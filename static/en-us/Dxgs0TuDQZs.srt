Before using reductions to prove that
certain languages are undecidable.

00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,939
It sometimes helps to get some practice
with the idea of reduction itself,

00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:08,650
as a kind of warm up.

00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,720
WIth this in mind, we've provided
a few programming exercises.

00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,220
Good luck.
