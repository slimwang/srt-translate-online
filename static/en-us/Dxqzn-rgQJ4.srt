There's in fact a look-at method on the camera itself, but most of the time, we

2
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:06,860
use the camera controls to let us move the camera around with the mouse. If you

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,105
run the exercise code, you'll see a grid and not much else. The drinking bird

4
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:13,800
has left the view. Why did he leave? Where did he go? We've had word that he's

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,076
been sighted at these coordinates. Your job is to properly set the target to

6
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:20,477
see what the bird's doing. You don't need to modify the camera's position or

00:00:20,477 --> 00:00:21,480
size itself.
