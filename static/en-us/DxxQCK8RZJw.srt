1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,430
Here's the solution I came up with.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,600
I chose columns 1 and 3 for my bases.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,820
Note that I couldn't
have chosen columns 1 and

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,620
2 because these are not
linearly independent.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,790
If that were the matrix B,
B wouldn't be invertible.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,270
Choosing 1 and 3 however,
gives me this matrix here as B.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,950
And I need to solve this equation for
the variables X1 and X3.

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,083
Simple substitution suffices here.

9
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:35,140
X1 must be equal to three and
X3 must be equal to 2, as a consequence.

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,740
And I just put in those answers here.
