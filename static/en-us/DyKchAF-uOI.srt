1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,550
So how do we compute this?

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:02,980
Well, first,

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:08,580
we want to be able to create a discrete
inverse response function from the data.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,900
And we refer to this as,
let's say, say G of Z,

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,685
and what we're basically interested
in for each pixel site, and

6
00:00:14,685 --> 00:00:18,675
I just showed you three in
the last image In image j.

7
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:21,575
I just showed you five, and
I basically showed the plot was,

8
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:23,565
were about 15 of them.

9
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:27,395
For each pixel site, and
we can choose a few good number of them,

10
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:31,415
all of the images,
we will compute the values, and

11
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:36,645
again we do this I'm in log here,
of both the exposures, And,

12
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:40,220
a time, to compute a function g(z).

13
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,870
I mean, doing in this log
allows us to do addition.

14
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,420
Otherwise, remember we would be
doing this as a multiplication.

15
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,510
Of course, what we have now is
an overdetermined linear system for

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,450
N pixels over P different
exposure images.

17
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:01,050
So again, we have P different
exposure images and we have N pixels.

18
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,500
We basically started off with I,
side pixel I and image J.

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,300
Now of course we have a number of
pixels that we want to measure,

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,580
and the number of exposures.

21
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,010
Remember, last time we basically showed
5, we had 15, and I had 3 points.

22
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,820
So N was 3, and
P was 15 to create those plots.

23
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,930
Now, of course, what we can do now is
create a system of linear equations,

24
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,949
log of exposure, log of the time itself.

25
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,320
And then, basically, subtracting by this
and this basically lets us do, you know,

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,490
these squared difference.

27
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,920
Of course, what we basically now do
is come up with a fitting term and

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
a smoothness term.

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,610
And this is the,

30
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:44,000
kind of way we basically solve these
types of linear optimization problems.
