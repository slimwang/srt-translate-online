00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,532
So now we know that lines y equals 4 and x equals 4 are reflections of one

2
00:00:04,532 --> 00:00:09,975
another in the line y equals x. If we flip either of them across this line, we

3
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:15,280
get the other one. Now, let's say we have some function that only intersects

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,194
the line y equals 4 one time. If we find its inverse, how many times will that

5
00:00:21,194 --> 00:00:24,693
curve intersect the line x equals 4?
