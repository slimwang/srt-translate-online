1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,070
One of the most exciting parts of this
machine learning engineer nano degree

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,890
program is that for the very first
time we are able to leverage

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,430
some of the materials that we've
produced as part of our partnership with

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,862
Georgia Tech on their online Master's
and Computer Science program.

5
00:00:10,862 --> 00:00:14,370
You're going to be hearing from the same
videos, the same professors that teach

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,160
graduate level machine learning
at Georgia Tech right now.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,110
You'll hear form Charles Isbell on
Michael Litman on the major schools of

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,090
thought on machine learning
like reinforcement learning and

9
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:22,906
supervised learning.

10
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:27,331
You'll hear from Goyle and I about
the more kindly oriented side of AI,

11
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:29,720
a different perspective
of what AI can do.

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,759
You'll also cover some classes
on applied machine learning,

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,150
specifically to certain domains
like trading and healthcare.

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,940
Now because these classes were produced
for the Georgia Tech online Masters

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,970
degree, they have their own learning
goals and we're using them in a way

16
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,330
that's a little bit different from
how they were originally produced.

17
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,580
So you might feel like it's
a little bit chaotic sometimes.

18
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,870
We'll try and
step in from time to time and

19
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,690
set the expectations and remind you
of what our learning goals are.

20
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,990
But we just wanted to let you know that
if you feel like it's a little bit

21
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,440
disjointed at times, that's intentional.

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,560
That kind of comes with the territory of
using the material that's been produced

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,080
for this master's program like this.
