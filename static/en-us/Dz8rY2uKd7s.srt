00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,932
>> In the last few quizzes, we figured out that if could get a quadratic

2
00:00:03,932 --> 00:00:08,412
equation in this form right here, with two factors involving an x to the first

3
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:12,977
power multiplied together. Then we could pretty easily find out where its x

4
00:00:12,977 --> 00:00:17,732
intercepts are. Or where that parabola cuts the x axis. Awesome. Just to cement

5
00:00:17,732 --> 00:00:22,417
that idea, let's do one more practice example involving these concepts. Let's

6
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:27,137
say then, that we have the equation y equals x minus 4 times x plus 3. If I want

7
00:00:27,137 --> 00:00:31,610
to find out, where this curve, intersects with the x axis, or in other words,

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,334
where its x intercepts are, what equation do we need to solve? Please write your

9
00:00:36,334 --> 00:00:41,018
answer in this box. Also, at this point, we don't need to multiply out anything,

10
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:45,207
or simplify at all. This is really just a one step problem at this point.
