00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,140
I want to introduce one more problem
that can be solved with search

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:03,540
techniques.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,900
And this is a sliding blocks
puzzle called the 15 Puzzle.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,359
You may have seen something like this.

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,629
So there are a bunch of little
squares or blocks or tiles and

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:20,780
you can slide them around, and the goal
is to get into a certain configuration.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,050
So we'll say that this is the goal
state where the numbers one to 15

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,109
are in order, left to right,
top to bottom.

9
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:31,619
And the starting state would be some
state where all the positions are messed

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,270
up, now the question is, can we come
up with a good heuristic for this?

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,640
And let's examine that as a way of
thinking about where heuristics come

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,369
from.

13
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:44,030
Now the first heuristic we're
going to consider, we'll call h1.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,320
And that's equal to,
the number of misplaced blocks.

15
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,689
So here, 10 and 11 are misplaced,
because they should be there and there,

16
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:53,570
respectively.

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,119
12's in the right place,
13 is in the right place.

18
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,969
And 14 and 15 are misplaced.

19
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:01,399
So that's a total of
four misplaced blocks.

20
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,890
The second Heuristic h2,
is equal to the sum of

21
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,424
the distances that each block would have
to move to get to the right position.

22
00:01:09,424 --> 00:01:15,200
So, for this position, 10 would have
to move one space to get to the right

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,210
position, 11 would have to move one so
that's a total of two so far.

24
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:23,309
13 is in the right place,
14 is one displaced.

25
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,409
And 15 is one displaced.

26
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,859
So that would also be a total of four.

27
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:32,819
Now the question is which, if any,
of these heuristics are admissible.

28
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:37,497
Check the boxes, next to the heuristics
that you think are admissible.

29
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:39,389
