00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,980
When I ran this experiment,
myself, Maps kind of surprised me.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,620
It'll actually let us drop a blank pin.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,220
Let's take a look now.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,480
We could see that the network
connections down again because I'm

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,620
getting these blank grid squares.

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,810
And if I click and hold to drop a pin,
then this blank pin is dropped.

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,520
Here's another nice side effect,
when the connection's restored,

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,220
the pin automatically updates
itself with a location.

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,370
This is about as graceful
as failure can get.
