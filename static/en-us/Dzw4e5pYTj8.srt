1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,930
Let's think about some of the first
things we would need to build

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:03,710
an application.

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,990
Like a real estate listing site.

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,099
First, we need to point
out locations on the map.

5
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:13,160
We're going to start off by mapping our
listings using lat-long coordinates.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,949
We'll learn how to get coordinates
from addresses later in the course.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,050
In order to keep this simple, we'll
just make one point on our map at first.

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,870
Within our initialized function,
we're going to create one lat-long.

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,310
We'll use the syntax seen here, which
is creating a lat-long literal object.

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,509
This point is in Tribeca.

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,340
Next, how do we make
it appear on the map?

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,930
We can use the little universally
recognized icon called a marker.

13
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,479
Markers are objects which can be
constructed either in the initialized

14
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,449
function or upon an action,
like clicking a button.

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,770
Let's create a super simple marker,

16
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,280
showing our first listing
at this point in Tribeca.

17
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:58,119
We're creating a new marker instance
using the google.maps.Marker object.

18
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:01,849
All the marker needs to know,
is the map that it should appear on and

19
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,519
where it should appear,
which is our point that we just created.

20
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,094
We'll also give the maker a title, which
will appear if we hover over the marker.

21
00:01:10,614 --> 00:01:12,545
There are a bunch more things
that we could specify.

22
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:16,504
We can make it draggable, so that when
it appears, the user can move around.

23
00:01:16,504 --> 00:01:19,765
We could specify an animations so
that it doesn't just appear on the map,

24
00:01:19,765 --> 00:01:23,507
it drops, for example,
let's test this out.

25
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:27,246
There's our marker, but a point
on a map doesn't do us much good.

26
00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:29,617
We have to tell the users
what they're looking at.

27
00:01:29,617 --> 00:01:32,347
Let's check out how to display some
information about the marker, next.
