1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,260
So, Charles, what did we learn about regression?

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,920
>> well, we learned a bunch of interesting historical facts about

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,570
where the word came from, which I thought was interesting anyway.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,672
>> Oh good.

5
00:00:12,672 --> 00:00:16,930
>> We learned about model selection and overfitting.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,300
And underfitting. And fitting in general, cross validation.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,920
>> Talked about, how to do linear and polynomial regression.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,888
>> Yeah.

9
00:00:28,888 --> 00:00:32,119
>> That the best constant, that the best

10
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,195
constant in terms of squared error is the mean.

11
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:36,828
>> Mh-hm

12
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,599
>> These little calculus for that.

13
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,285
>> Well we also did the same thing for well we talked about

14
00:00:44,285 --> 00:00:49,050
the process for how you do it in genreral for any polynomial function.

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,300
>> I think that's everything.

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,710
>> Well one more thing, and we talked a little

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,875
bit about representation, and how to make that work in regression.

18
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,460
>> Great, we talked about input representations

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,610
and what some of the issues are. There.

20
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,830
>> Yeah.

21
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,930
>> Great, I think that's, I think that's a good amount.

22
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:05,450
>> I think so, too.
