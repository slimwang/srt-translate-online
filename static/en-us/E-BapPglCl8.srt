1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,719
So, how useful is active network? There

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:04,880
are lots of potential applications that can be

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,910
built using this active network's paradigm. In

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,390
particular, what we want to do is, when

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,080
ever we desire certain ways to visualize

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,470
the behavior of the network. Then active networks

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,060
become very useful. So, for instance, for

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,760
implementing protocol independent multicast reliable multicast, or noticing

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,310
congestions in the network and notifying the source

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,316
and the destination about the congestions, private IP, any

11
00:00:32,316 --> 00:00:34,220
casting. These are all the kinds of things

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,670
that are useful to implement using active networks. And

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,920
as you can see from this list, the kinds of things that you want to do, using

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,070
active networks, are things that are related to network

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,170
functionality. Not high-level application,

16
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,590
but network functionality. In particular,

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,770
it is useful for building applications that are difficult to

18
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,230
deploy in the internet. So, when you rely on the

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,810
routing and the internet, it is entirely an administrative set

20
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,819
up, and the administrative set up tends to mirror the

21
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,610
physical set up. But, for your particular network flow, you

22
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,900
may want a set up that is different from the

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,260
physical set up. And the example I give you of

24
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,970
me sending a greeting that will be a single message

25
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,370
for most of the traverse through the internet,

26
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,720
but at some point, it may actually get demultiplexed

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,470
and get sent to several different destinations. Those

28
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,410
kinds of multicasting and things like that, are specific

29
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,270
to network flow. So, we are in some

30
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:35,190
sense, overlaying our own desire on topology, on top

31
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,000
of the physical topography of the internet, by using

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,080
the active network paradigm. But, the key properties that

33
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,910
you want to have for applications that you want

34
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,970
to build using the active networks paradigm, is that

35
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,700
the applications should be expressible and it should be

36
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,660
compact and it should be fast and it should not

37
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,240
rely on all the notes being active. These are

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,230
key things to note in building applications that live on

39
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,580
top of the active networks. So all of these

40
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,310
suggest, once again, what I said already and that is,

41
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,160
it is for providing network layer functionality,

42
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,550
not end application functionality. So, what you want

43
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,740
in the network layer, that is something

44
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,990
that again orchestrate using the active networks paradigm.
