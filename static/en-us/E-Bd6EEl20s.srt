00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,330
Now I'd like you to try your hand at
selections and manipulating text.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,030
I want you to write some D3 code that
will change the text of the main title

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,660
on this page from Data Visualization and
D3.JS to Gapminder World China.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,526
Now, you shouldn't use
document.getElementById or

5
00:00:19,526 --> 00:00:24,770
document.QuerySelector, instead,
I'd like you to use the D3 methods.

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,280
Enter your code in the box.
