1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,490
Read through what you've got as
far as the nouns are concerned.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,427
>> Sure.

3
00:00:04,427 --> 00:00:09,603
Pile, parts, tree, tree again,

4
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:14,273
pile, count, leaves, zero.

5
00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:15,880
Most of these are repeats.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,850
Subtrees, leaf and leaves so.

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,560
Yes, I think those are my main nouns.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,070
>> Didn't you underline them in there?

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,660
>> I did.

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,159
That one I was kind of wary of just
because of it didn't seem to be

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,970
something that would be descriptive
enough to maybe give us an object later.

12
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,750
It's just, what's the word?

13
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,280
>> I think you're right there.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,380
Pronouns are going to refer to something
else that's already in the text, so

15
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,620
you don't worry about pronouns.
