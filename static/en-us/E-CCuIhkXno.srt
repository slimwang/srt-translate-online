All the operations and functions
explained in this lesson are those

00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,790
which will help you perform computation.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,660
But there is a lot more to learn.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,780
Check out the link in
the instructor notes.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,480
I will meet you in the next
lesson with some more coding.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,650
Happy coding with Python and
bye until then.
