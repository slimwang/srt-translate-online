Now let's switch gears and talk about drug therapy for schizophrenia. As I

2
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:07,822
mentioned at the beginning of this lesson, the phenothiazines were discovered

3
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:12,669
in the 1950s and they were found to be more effective than placebo. That is,

4
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:15,945
when patients were given a placebo their symptoms did not improve, but when

5
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:21,348
they were given the phenothiazine their symptoms did improve. These drugs help

6
00:00:21,348 --> 00:00:24,996
reduce the hallucinations, delusions, agitation, and paranoia that these

7
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:30,965
patients experienced. Therefore, these drugs became widely used. Now there are

8
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:35,221
two major groups of antipsychotics. The conventional antipsychotics, which were

9
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:38,686
made before the mid 1990s and the atypical antipsychotics, which have been

10
00:00:38,686 --> 00:00:41,780
developed in about the last ten years.
