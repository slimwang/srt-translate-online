00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,502
This is similar to what Piaget did. He took a toy from a six to seven month old

2
00:00:04,502 --> 00:00:09,191
infant, and then covered it up with a blanket or towel. And found that infants

3
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:12,656
would look at this and be really confused, but then just go on to do something

4
00:00:12,656 --> 00:00:17,594
else, because they totally that the toy even exists. This is what Piaget called

5
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:22,024
object permanence. The abilitiy to understand an object is permemant even if

6
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:27,153
you can't sense it. This is why babies think pee a boo is so much fun. The

7
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:31,564
adult keeps appearing and disappearing behind their hands. But notice that

8
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:35,102
infants grow out of enjoying pee a boo when they develop the cognitive

9
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:38,740
capability to understand object permanence.
