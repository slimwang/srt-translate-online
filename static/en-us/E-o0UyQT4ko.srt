00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,130
To quickly summarize, basically
introduce the concept of light field,

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:09,150
to kind of let us get away from the
whole concept of just pixels in cameras.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,220
We talked about the plenoptic function,
and the parameters that could be encoded

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,560
in the plenoptic function,
how we would represent them.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,700
We talked about different
types of light fields and

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,990
what dimensions they captured from
holograms to simple panoramas.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,910
We looked at how a pinhole in a lens
system can be used to analyze

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,630
the scene and capture more
than just pixel information.

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,380
I showed you just by creating
an eccentric aperture

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,830
we can actually encode more information.

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:41,240
And also that combining a lens with a,
an array of pinhole cameras,

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,660
we can encode direction and
intensity of the rays of light.

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:50,224
And, using these concepts, and, again,
basically a lens and micro-lens arrays,

14
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:54,610
lenticular arrays and stuff like that,
we can build a 40 light field camera.

15
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,690
And I demonstrated at least one of them.

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,090
The premise of all of this was to,
basically, kind of now ask us to

17
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,019
push beyond the simple metrics
of cameras as we know them.

18
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,350
And start thinking of cameras that
capture a lot more light fields, and

19
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,900
that could be used to generate images by
combining information from the different

20
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,360
types of sensors.

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,300
Further reading on this one
available through the papers that

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,838
I'm listing here.

23
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:22,059
Some of the earliest work on defining
the plenoptic function comes in 1991,

24
00:01:22,059 --> 00:01:24,368
including the first
system to do it in 92.

25
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:28,405
And then of course, the graphics people
developed these approaches to kind of

26
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:30,660
render and capture light fields.

27
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,120
And then of course,
a light field camera itself.

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,345
Much more work continues
to happen in this space.

29
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:39,930
I encourage you to look it up,
a very exciting discipline on its own.

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,320
>> More information is available
elsewhere including the book that we're

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,470
looking at and also at the Lytro site.
