00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So just to summarize for a Google search, each had its own value proposition,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
but most importantly each had its own revenue stream,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and one segment cannot exist without the other--that is, if you had users

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but you had no revenue, you'd be out of business over time.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But if you had a revenue model but no users, there would be no reason for those

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
advertisers to show up. Now this was an example of a 2-sited market.

00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's see what happens when we have multiple sites.
