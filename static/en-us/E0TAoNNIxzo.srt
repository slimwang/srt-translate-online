1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is 4851,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
so suppose we have 100 people, and I'm not going to try and draw 100 people,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
but here we have N people.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In order to be able to communicate with everyone else,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
the first person will need a shared key with every other person,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
so that's going to be N-1 key shared between Alice

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and the N-1 other people.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The second person already has a shared key with Alice

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but needs a shared key with everyone else.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That is N-2 additional keys.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The third person that has keys shared with Alice and Bob

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
needs a key with everyone else, and this continues until

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
the next to last person, who needs a key shared with the last person.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That means we need the summation from N-1 down to 1,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
or we can think of that going forward 1+2+...up to N-1,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and that simplifies to N-1 times N-2 divided by 2.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
For 100 people, this would be 99 times 98 divided by 2,

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
which is 4851, which might not sound too bad,

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
but 100 people is a pretty small number.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If we think of doing this for the billion or so people on the internet,

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
then we would need around 10 to the 18 keys.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This isn't really a solution, both because of the huge number of keys that are needed

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and the need to establish all of these pairwise keys.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We haven't really solved our problem.
