1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,830
We're going to start off this unit with a small technical detail.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,130
When we considered our three problems, vertex cover, independent set, and clique,

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,220
we always said that we were looking for the best possible solution.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,460
So, for example, for the largest independent set or the smallest vertex cover.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,460
This type of problem is known as an optimization problem

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,300
because we're trying to maximize or minimize some value.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,950
In this unit, we're mostly going to work with a slightly different

8
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,420
version of these problems called decision problems.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,300
So we're not going to ask, for example, what is the smallest possible vertex cover?

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:40,370
But rather we're going to ask, does a graph have a vertex cover that is smaller than some number of k?

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,240
And k is given to us in advance.

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,040
So the main difference between an optimization problem and a decision problem

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,650
is that for an optimization problem, we ask, find us the best possible solution?

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,080
Or what's the best possible value that we can achieve?

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,560
And in a decision problem, we have to ask, is it possible to achieve a value of k?

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:08,200
And so up here the answer will be some number. And down here, the answer can only be yes or no.

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,040
And there are two main reasons why we do this.

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,190
First of all, it makes our lives much easier in some of the proofs that we're going to dive into.

19
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,860
And secondly, it's also a little bit more accurate because when you talk about

20
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,020
the P versus NP problem, although it's often stated for optimization problems

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,790
such as those we have so far discussed, the whole theory

22
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,240
has actually been developed for decision problems.

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,860
Now, you're probably thinking what difference does it make to talk

24
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,610
about an optimization problem versus a decision problem?

25
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,700
Or is this going to make any significant difference, for example, with the question of tractability

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,450
versus intractability and actually it doesn't really make that much of a difference,

27
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,430
but I'll actually have you figure out the details here in our next quiz.

28
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,910
And I would like you to think about four things and then give me your answer.

29
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:57,890
So the first question is, if the optimization version of a problem turns out to be tractable,

30
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,980
then what about the decision version of that problem?

31
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:07,290
Do we know that decision versions for sure to be tractable, intractable, or can we really say?

32
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,880
The second question I have for you is the same thing, only with intractability,

33
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,380
so if we know the optimization version of a problem to be intractable,

34
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,090
then what about the decision version, is that for sure, going to be tractable, intractable,

35
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,430
or is this a case where we can't really make a clear statement having only this information here

36
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,550
that the optimization version is intractable, and finally questions number 3 and 4

37
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:33,200
are exactly the other way around than questions 1 and 2, so here we have information

38
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,960
about the decision version of a problem, so question number 3,

39
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,120
if the decision version of a problem is tractable, then what about the optimization version?

40
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,550
And question number 4, if the decision version of a problem is intractable,

41
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,330
then what about the optimization version?

42
00:02:48,330 --> 99:59:59,999
So please give your answers here with one of each of the three possible choices here.
