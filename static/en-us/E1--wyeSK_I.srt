1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,320
Let's look at this pipeline again or

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,400
these elements again in the context of a panorama.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,765
[INAUDIBLE] panorama, basically, we are going to be able to look at the optics,

4
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:14,105
the sensor, processing, the display, to a user, to get a pretty panorama.

5
00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:19,400
So for example, here are the images, I'm showcasing seven images,

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,460
of a cricket ground, the famous Lord's Cricket Ground in London, England.

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,020
And if you notice, this was taken by a camera as the camera was

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,820
being panned from left to right.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,180
So we have seven images, one, two, three, four, five, six, and seven.

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,470
The goal of panorama building is to take this image and generate an image like

11
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,450
this, which basically is a seamless image that basically shows more detail and

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,200
space than an individual image there.

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,060
Just looking at the numbers, these are seven pictures, each picture was

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,620
about seven megapixels, so this is 7.1 megapixel each image, okay?

15
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:03,140
This is the panorama, this is 11,000x2,000 pixels, so that's 31 megapixel, and

16
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:10,525
more appropriately, the field of view is 151 degrees wide, and 24 degrees high.

17
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:15,160
Individually of course, you can imagine that, the vertical field of view for

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,060
each and every one of these images is the same, approximately as that, but, of

19
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,280
course this shows a lot more space because it's got a much wider field of view.

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,025
We'll talk about the concept of field of view a little later, but, right now,

21
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:32,980
basically think of it as this showing more, angular space, then each and

22
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,120
every individual one which is most really just this much,

23
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,200
going spreading out this way.
