00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,710
In lesson four, you wrote a class to compute some ugly fractions and averages.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,290
These methods don't need any instance variables. They should have been static

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:13,361
methods. We could easily make them static. And then in the tester, instead of

4
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:17,267
creating a math and Java object and then calling that, we could remove this

5
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:23,430
step and call the methods directly on the class. Which would look like this.

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,875
This would make it more obvious that these methods do computations based only

7
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:31,732
on their parameters. Their behavior won't be influenced by factors like

8
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:35,500
instance variables. So, go ahead and convert these three methods to static

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,240
methods, so that the tester can work without creating an object.
