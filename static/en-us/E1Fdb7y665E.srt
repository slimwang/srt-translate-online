1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,530
So the keyword this makes it possible for it to build just one

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:08,000
function object and use that as a method on a bunch of other objects.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,560
And every time we call the method,

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,140
it'll have access to whatever object it's being called on.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,880
This can be really useful for conserving memory,

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,060
and it's only possible because we have access to the parameter this.
