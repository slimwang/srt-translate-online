1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,840
Just to help us understand how we can do this kind of stuff,

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,450
I'm going to simplify this concept and

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:09,750
now showcase a simple way of how we can do a derivative of an image.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,410
Again, you've seen this already just a of the image itself.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,710
Now we're going to look at it with x, which basically means,

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:23,350
in a I'm going to look for a value, x plus 1, which basically means in this one.

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:28,010
And x plus the next column, keep the y the same, and of course, I look for

8
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,750
the original column, x itself.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,810
And I just subtract that and that'll give me the difference.

10
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,350
We have done this in the previous style sub lecture also.

11
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,460
Let's just simplify this and look what we can actually do to

12
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,750
extract basically this concept of derivative as a local product.

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,550
Those of you remember from previous lessons, local product, dot product, inner

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,650
product was something which was relevant in the concept of cross correlation.

15
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,460
Here, I've just simplified this by basically multiplying the first term with 1

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,670
and the second term with minus 1 to get rid of the plus sign here.

17
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,310
Let's rearrange this whole term.

18
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,830
So when rearranged, now we have moved the negative term in front.

19
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,130
And the positive term later.

20
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,950
Of course we can rewrite this form as a dot product.

21
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,980
Of minus and the 1 as a simple vector.

22
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,970
And then, of course, the f x and the f x plus 1,y as the other one.

23
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,218
So this dot product is basically now,

24
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:26,990
in essence, how we could compute something like this.

25
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,860
Now, of course, this is interesting because, in simple terms,

26
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,230
sometimes I could replace this dot product in case of images with

27
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,030
a cross correlation because in essence that's what this process would be.

28
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,600
So this should start telling us something.

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,050
This, for example, could be my kernel and this is my input.

30
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:48,560
Right?

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,180
So looking at that kind of wave we can now start thinking about how we

32
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,430
can actually start doing similar types of processing.

33
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,070
Now of course this is still a dot product.

34
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,730
I'm simplifying this to kind of say this is cross correlation.

35
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,710
We'll look at that in a bit.
