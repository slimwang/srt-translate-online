1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You can see the earliest and latest start times filled in for all the states.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Here's an alternative method for visualizing this.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Here I've given names to the various actions--

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the three on the top and the three on the bottom.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They have a duration along a time line, and we can see the time line there.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Notice that these three actions have no slack between them.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
One has to start after the other.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We say that these are on the critical path in that if any of these slip in the schedule,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
then the whole schedule will slip.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Whereas these three actions have some slack.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The could occur anywhere within this gray window,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and if this action slipped to the right, then the others would slip to the right

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
without affecting the final schedule.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I should say that over the years the field of scheduling has moved

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
in and out of the artificial intelligence.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Some people have worked on it, but most of the work on scheduling

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
has been done in the field of operations research-

18
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
a closely related field to artificial intelligence.
