00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,270
Our simplified answer is 5x cubed y cubed times the cube root of 2x squared y.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,875
Now that's pretty amazing if you got it right on your first try. If you

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:12,395
stumbled a little bit, that's definitely okay, see if you can find your first

4
00:00:12,395 --> 00:00:16,827
mistake in the solution video. Then pause it to see if you can work toward this

5
00:00:16,827 --> 00:00:22,458
answer. We start by simplifying the cube root of 54 and the cube root of 16. We

6
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:27,152
want to split this up into 27 times 2. This allows us to take the cube root of

7
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:32,740
27, which we know is 3. The same is true for 16. We split it up into 8 times 2,

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,650
so we can take the cube root of 8. So for this first radical, we know the cube

9
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:41,298
root of 27 equals 3. This 2 stays inside of the radical, since we don't have

10
00:00:41,298 --> 00:00:45,598
the 2 repeated 3 times. Now we can use power divided by root to simplify our

11
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:51,838
variables. For x, we'll have 8 divided by 3, which equals 2 remainder 2. This

12
00:00:51,838 --> 00:00:55,744
means we'll have x squared on the outside of our radical, And x squared on the

13
00:00:55,744 --> 00:00:59,650
inside of a radical for the variable y we'll have 10 divided by 3 which equals

14
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:05,430
3 remainder 1. This means we'll have y cubed on the outside of a radical and 1

15
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,790
y or just y on the inside of a radical for the second radical we want to take

16
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:15,546
the cubed root of 8 which equals 2. This to just stays inside the radical. For

17
00:01:15,546 --> 00:01:21,240
the variable x we use power divided by root, this gives us one remainder two.

18
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,365
So will have one x outside of a radical and x squared inside of a radical. For

19
00:01:26,365 --> 00:01:30,940
y will have two remainder one so y squared on the outside And Y to the 1 on the

20
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:37,247
inside. We multiply these numbers together to get 9 x cubed, y cubed over here

21
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:45,290
we multiply them as well. We'll have 4 x to the third and y cubed. Notice that

22
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,499
this term and this term has X cubed Y cubed times the cube root of 2x squared

23
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:55,448
y. This means that they are like. So really we're just going to do 9 minus 4

24
00:01:55,448 --> 00:02:01,188
and then multiply it by the trailing variables and radical. 9 minus 4 equals 5,

25
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:05,123
so this is our final result.
