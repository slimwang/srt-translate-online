1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now let's go ahead and redefine bridge problem in terms of lowest cost search,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
thereby generalizing it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In the initialization code you might need here a single call to lowest<u>cost</u>search.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Any other functions you need to define here.
