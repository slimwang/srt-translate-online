00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
in this tutorial we started by curating

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,139
a data set of movie review and label

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:06,389
pairs then we trained neural network on

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:08,279
these movie reviews and found that x by

5
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:09,990
itself it actually could not converge on

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,820
the data set so we adjusted the

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,320
parameters and got to start converting a

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,759
little bit but learning was incredibly

9
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,679
slow and only actually reached accuracy

10
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:18,300
around sixty percent is not that much

11
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,789
better than random after understanding

12
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:22,589
the fundamental pattern over trying to

13
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:23,850
discover we were able to significantly

14
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,730
reduce the noise in our dataset increase

15
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,079
the signal so that are known that was

16
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,670
able to discover our pattern much more

17
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,340
quickly like iterating several times to

18
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,479
the course of these different six

19
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,100
projects were able to achieve an

20
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,539
accuracy it was much higher in a

21
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,969
training speed was much much faster than

22
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,049
we started with

23
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:41,549
I hope you will find these techniques

24
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:43,469
generalized to pretty much any problem

25
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:44,909
you're interested in attacking the

26
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:46,530
neural networks will be incredibly

27
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,549
useful to you out in the real world
