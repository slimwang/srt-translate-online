00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's one more topic.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We're going to talk about how to extend classicial planning to allow active perception

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to deal with partial observability.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Here's a problem description.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There's a table and a chair, and there are two cans of paint.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The table is within our field of view,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and our goal is to have the chair and the table have the same color.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Here's the actions.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We can remove the lid from a can, making it open.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We can paint one thing with that can if the can is open.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We also have an active perception action,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
which is we can look at something.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If it's in view, we can look at it,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and then we're looking at that one thing, and we're no longer looking

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
at whatever we were looking at before.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now, here's the big extension that in addition to actions,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
we now have percept schemas.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Action schemas and perception schemas,

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and we can perceive the color of something if it's an object.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Here the objects are declared to be the table and the chair,

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and if it's within our field of view.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Notice that here we're introducing a new variable.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We never did that before in planning.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Before all the actions in planning, all the variables,

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
were predefined by matching against the precondition.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Here we're introducing a new variable.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We're saying if these preconditions are true,

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
then you can perceive something, and you'll learn something new.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You'll learn the value of this variable.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Here's a question. How can we achieve this goal?

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The first thing I want to ask is, without even thinking about the percepts,

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
is there a conformant plan that is a that doesn't do sensing

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
that will allow us to achieve this goal?

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Is there that type of conformant plan?

35
00:01:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Tell me yes or no.
