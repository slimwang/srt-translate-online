1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,873
Well, just like in the serial code we're going to have 64 multiplications to perform,

2
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:08,083
but now we can perform all of these multiplications in parallel.

3
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:10,848
It's going to take 10 nanoseconds.

4
00:00:10,848 --> 00:00:14,249
This is a good example of the throughput versus latency debate.

5
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:19,023
The latency of each operation is certainly longer than what we saw in the CPU case.

6
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:21,158
But because we can do them in parallel,

7
00:00:21,158 --> 00:00:25,000
we both complete faster and have a higher throughput.
