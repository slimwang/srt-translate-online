1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,947
So what was unethical by today's standards however was when Milgram told

2
00:00:03,947 --> 00:00:07,652
participants that they had no choice but to continue in the research even when

3
00:00:07,652 --> 00:00:13,166
they didn't want to. Now to be fair to Milgram he was not breaking any rules

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:16,204
because there were no rules at the time about how to treat participants and

5
00:00:16,204 --> 00:00:22,050
what they could and couldn't do. But in fact as a result of Milgram's study,

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,030
those rules came into existence as guidelines. Now, remember from lesson two

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,540
that the essence of these guidelines are first, that every participant sign a

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,360
consent form. Every participant be told in this consent form that they can

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,386
withdraw at any time, without penalty, and finally, that every participant be

10
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:44,510
told afterwards what the study was about. And that is, debriefed.
