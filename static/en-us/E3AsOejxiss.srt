1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,730
The final step in your
custom view creation

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,460
is adding interactivity.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,270
You can listen for user input events

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,360
including key presses, 
trackball movement,

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,370
and most importantly, 
screen touch events.

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,450
All by overriding the 
corresponding event handlers.

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,820
Android supports tracking of 
up to 11 individual contact points

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,760
in what we like to call,
jazzhands mode

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,260
which enables you
to complete

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,080
complex, multi-finger
interaction models.

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,940
Now, there's really no interaction
required for a wind gauge,

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,180
but you can find out more 
about handling input events

13
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,040
by checking the motion event docs 
or the developer guide

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,320
describing how to create your own, 
fully interactive custom views,

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,680
both from the instruction notes below.

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,110
Now, be careful not to let this
new found power go to your head.

17
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,460
By definition, your users
will have never encountered

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,670
your brand spanking new control.

19
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,746
So learning how to use it 
is going to add friction

20
00:00:48,746 --> 00:00:50,232
to the use of your app.

21
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:53,650
At the very least, it should behave 
consistently with the rest of the system

22
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,420
and you should avoid creating
your own versions of system controls.

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,560
If it looks kind of like a button 
and works kind of like a button,

24
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,894
you should probably
just go ahead and use a button.

25
00:01:04,894 --> 00:01:08,225
But I think this non sequitur 
has gone on long enough.
