00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,940
Let's return to our scatter plot that summarized the relationship between

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,020
age and mean friend count. Recall that we ended up creating this

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,050
plot from the new data frame that we created using the

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,700
d ply r package. The plot looked like this. As you can

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,170
see, the black line has a lot of random noise to

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,640
it. That is, the mean friend count rises and falls over each

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,950
age. Let's print out some of our data frame to have

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:26,140
a closer look. As we can see, the mean friend count increases,

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,750
then decreases later. In one particular case, we can see

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,250
that for 30 year olds, the mean friend count is

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,090
actually lower compared to the 29 year olds and the

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,910
31 year olds. Now some year to year discontinuities might make

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,770
sense, such as the spike at age 69. But others

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,440
are likely just to be noise around the true smoother

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,300
relationship between age and friend count. That is, they reflect

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,510
that we just have a sample from the data generating process.

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,040
And so the estimated mean friend count for each age

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,360
is the true mean plus some noise. We can imagine

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,560
that the noise for this plot would be worse if

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,680
we chose finer bins for age. For example, we could estimate

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,400
conditional means for each age, measured in months instead of

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,840
years. Over the next few programming exercises, you're going to

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,230
do just that. You're going to create a plot just like

24
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,930
this one with a new variable that measures ages in months

25
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,510
instead of years. Then you'll plot the conditional mean for

26
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,210
ages in months, and we'll compare this graph to the

27
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,360
one that you create. To start, you're going to create

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,730
the age with months variable, and save it into the data

29
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,240
frame. This variable will have each user's age measured in

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,420
months rather than in years. So, if a user is 36

31
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,060
years old and was born in March, the user's age

32
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,270
would be 36.75. Try coding this up in R for yourself.

33
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,270
And then once you have the code, copy and

34
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,980
paste it into the browser and submit. Now, this is

35
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,330
one of the exercises where the grader will automatically

36
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,730
check your output. Don't worry if you don't get this

37
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,970
one right on your first try. It's pretty tough.

38
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,900
I really recommend thinking about ages and people being born

39
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,070
in different months. How would that affect the variable age

40
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,990
with months? Working with actual values might help you here.
