1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, just to give you a review of scoring if you aren't familiar with the rules.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The letters score their value--the number that's on them--times whatever you've placed them on

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
if that's a double or triple letter score.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Here I don't have any double or triple letter scores, so I get the individual values of the letters--

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
10, 11, 12, 22--times the total word multiplier,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and the pink square are double word scores,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
so that's a double multiplier--22 times 2 is 44 points for that.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Then if the next play goes here, it has to connect.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now, this was a double word, but I don't get any double, because I didn't actually place

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
a new tile over an existing double word, so nothing is doubled,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but I do get credit for the Z, even though I didn't place the Z.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I get credit for that as 10, not as 20 as it originally scored, but as its face value--

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
10 plus 1--this is a triple 1, so that's plus 3 plus 1--10, 11, 14, 15.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Then if the next play, say, was here, that would just a score 3, 4, 5.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I didn't have any bonuses whatsoever.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This bonus here doesn't count, because I didn't play over it.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If a bonus is already covered up, it doesn't county any more, so this would just be 5.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
One more scoring rule.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If this is the word on the board--great play putting the Q on a double letter

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and a double word as well--this would score 20--1, 2, 3, 4 times 2 is 48.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The next play could be this, which simultaneously forms 3 words--

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
NO in this direction and then IN and NO in this direction.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
For NO, we'd get a double letter is 2 plus 1 is 3.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
For IN, we get just 1 plus 1, so that's 3 plus 2 is 5.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And for NO we get another 3, so that would be a score of 8 altogether.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Here is calculate_score. It takes all these variables that we need to specify the play.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We're going to start out a total of my word multiplier--

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that is, have I got any double or triple letters, and there might be more than one of them.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If I had a long word that matches up with some existing letters on the board,

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
then I'd get credit, and if. I covered a double and a triple letter, then I'd multiply by 6

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I need to keep track of that. Then I also want to keep track of the cross word totals.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Not the word I'm playing but the other cross words, but they are separate from this word multiplier.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Figure out where my starting position is from that position.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Figure out the direction that I'm moving in--down or across--what the delta are.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Figure out what the other direction is.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If I'm moving in the cross direction, I want to know that the other direction is the down direction.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now just enumerate the words.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Enumerate the letters in the word and the position within the word.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Figure out the square on the board and the bonus squares, the word multiplier,

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
if the square was already placed on the board,

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
so if it is a letter--and I've got a function for that.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I should be defining this here, so this is a bad piece code.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I should be calling is_letter(sq) rather than testing directly,

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
since is decided to make that more abstract.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Figure out the word multiplier from the bonuses.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You only get the bonus if the letter wasn't already on the board.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Figure out the letter multipler--same thing.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Increment my points by the points from the letter times the letter multiplier,

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and now if the square is an anchor and the anchor is not one of these unrestricted anchors,

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
then we want to look for the cross words.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If there is a cross word, figure out the cross word score and add that into the total.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Why do I have this direction is not down here?

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Because I'm going to do--cross word score is going to recursively calculate score,

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and we don't want it to recurse infinitely. We just want it to recurse once.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
To explain that a little bit more, note up here in horizontal_plays we're calling calculate _score,

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
so the only place we call calculate_score is here, and we're calling it with the across.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The way we get the down is because we transpose the board.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So for calculate score, we know we're going to be called with the across direction the first time

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and then the down direction the second time.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Although, I guess I feel a little bit bad that that assumption that we're always going to be called

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
with across the first time is kind of hardwired into this.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That makes calculate_score a little bit brittle.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Probably, I should refactor this to stop the recursion in some other way.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But I'm so close to the finish line now I don't want to stop to clean things up.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I want to get to the end.

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Here is cross<u>word</u>score. Figure out the position.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We find the cross word. That's a function we already wrote.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Then we recursively call calculate_score.
