1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,335
Let's pull just one of these
commands out to start.

2
00:00:04,335 --> 00:00:08,850
8.8.8.8 is the address of
a particular service at Google.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,430
And ping is a command for testing
whether your computer can send and

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,352
receive network traffic
with that address.

5
00:00:14,352 --> 00:00:22,070
And -c3 means to send three test
messages, then quit and print results.

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,960
All traffic on the Internet is split
up into messages called packets.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,846
A packet is just a short message sent
from one computer to another with

8
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:32,803
the addresses of the sender and
the recipient on it.

9
00:00:32,803 --> 00:00:36,948
You can imagine that network traffic is
made up of a stream of little postcards

10
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:41,412
going back and forth, carried over the
various media like Wi-Fi, and ethernet,

11
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:42,898
and cable modems and so on.

12
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:46,677
The ping command sends and
receives individual packets to

13
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:51,009
test whether traffic can get from
one address to another and back.

14
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:58,011
So if you ran ping -c3 8.8.8.8,
pinging this service at Google.

15
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:01,904
And you got results that looked
like these, specifically,

16
00:01:01,904 --> 00:01:05,731
3 packets transmitted,
3 received, 0% packet loss.

17
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:08,668
Which of the following
conclusions seem reasonable?

18
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,836
One, that your computer
has Internet access.

19
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:16,051
Two, that the computer at
8.8.8.8 is up and running.

20
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:21,914
Three, that there is a website you
could access at http:// 8.8.8.8.

21
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:25,368
Four, that your computer is
directly on Google's network.

22
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:29,460
Or five, that your ISP knows how
to send traffic towards Google.

23
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,800
Check whichever ones of these apply.
