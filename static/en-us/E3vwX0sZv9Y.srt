00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,280
It doesn't matter which order we go in. Our observed frequency of 41 minus our

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:13,290
expected frequency of 33 squared divided by 33, plus our observed frequency

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,220
number two minus the expected frequency divided by the expected frequency, is

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:25,920
about 2.89. Good job. Now that we have our chi squared statistic, we need to

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,290
compare that to the chi squared critical value, just like we've done with all

6
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:29,890
the other tests.
