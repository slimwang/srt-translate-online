00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,420
There are a couple of cool little properties of BRDF.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:08,950
One named Helmholtz, after the guy Helmholtz, basically light

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:13,650
doesn't know which way's up, or another way of saying it is it's a reciprocity.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,620
That is, if a light source is coming this way, and

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,420
the camera is going that way, and I swap the camera and the light source,.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,820
I get the same, reflectance function, right?

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,450
So, it doesn't matter whether the light comes in this way and

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,550
goes out that way, or comes in this way and goes out that way.

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,369
There is no light diode, for the nerds among us, all right?

10
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,350
There probably are, you probably could build active light diodes, but

11
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,240
for normal properties you don't get that for our purposes,

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,530
there's another important property which is referred to as rotational symmetry.

13
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,620
And the way of thinking about that is.

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,590
If I rotate the surface, about the normal, nothing's going to change.

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,370
All right.

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,790
And what that, essentially means is is that I only have to

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,130
worry about the little tangent plane right at the point that I'm looking.

18
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:06,300
And so the only thing that matters, is the relative direction between these.

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,170
Not just in, in terms of here I want to talk about the amount around the angle.

20
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,610
So the absolute, angle doesn't matter just the, relative distance between them.

21
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,520
And that's written like this.

22
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,779
The absolute angle in terms of the tilt still matters, okay?

23
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:23,810
And we'll, we'll show you that in just a minute.

24
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,440
But the, the rotation around, is only relative.

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,770
Around the normal.

26
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,180
Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions for

27
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,470
real objects, can be incredibly complicated here's a sort of,

28
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,030
little panoply of different types of reflectance functions.

29
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,240
We're not going to talk any more, about those.

30
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,760
If you want to do,

31
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,310
take a computer graphics course and learn how to render hair or.

32
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,420
See this bird down here by the way.

33
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,570
I think it's peacock feather.

34
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,350
It's actually not dye, but

35
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,690
it's refractive so bird feathers are actually not painted if you will.

36
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,090
But they refract the light through the material that's in it.

37
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,446
It's a very complicated BRDF.

38
00:02:02,446 --> 00:02:06,470
We're not going to talk anymore about that, because we're going to talk about.

39
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,980
Two specific reflectance functions, that are special cases of BRDF's, and

40
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,880
that you can combine them to sort of make most normal types of objects.

41
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,780
Namely we're going to talk about what's called diffuse, or

42
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,210
matte reflection, plus specular reflection.
