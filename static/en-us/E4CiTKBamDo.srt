1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,080
Armed with an abstract model of
a message-passing algorithm, what about

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,630
a programming model that implements it
so that we can write an actual program.

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,660
That's the topic of this lesson.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,100
It's a particular library standard
called the message passing interface,

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,230
or MPI for short.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,430
Now I've picked out a couple
of things for you to read so

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,290
that you can get familiar
with how MPI works.

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,580
The main things I want you
to keep an eye out for

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,150
are how to do hello world in MPI.

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,250
How to do asynchronous sends and
receives using the routines MPI I send,

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,600
I receive, wait, and wait all.

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,620
How to use the built in collective
operations like barriers, reductions,

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,320
scatters, gathers, all to alls.

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,015
And finally,
what the heck is a communicator?

15
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:47,580
MPI_COMM_WORLD, what is that?

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,120
Now, sometime after you're done,
I'm sure there will be

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,440
an assignment of some sort to give
you hands on experience with MPI.

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,210
So pay attention!
