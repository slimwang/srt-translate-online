1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,404
Now that we've found out another 0 of our function, we should automatically

2
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:08,538
know what one of its factors is. One of its linear factors to be precise. So,

3
00:00:08,538 --> 00:00:14,266
what factor is associated a 0 of 1 half. Please fill in just integers in these

4
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:17,738
two boxes, and make sure that the numbers you fill in have a greatest common

5
00:00:17,738 --> 00:00:19,704
factor of 1.
