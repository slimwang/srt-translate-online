00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,260
Now I'd like you to implement levels for your cat.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,050
Let's say that new cats have a level of newborn cat.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,490
After ten clicks, they get up to infant.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,938
Go ahead and use computed observables to add cat levels to your application.

5
00:00:14,938 --> 00:00:19,380
Now remember, you'll also need to add something to your HTML so you can show it.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,670
Hey, I'm a pretty fast clicker.

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,926
I already got up to 110 here.

8
00:00:22,926 --> 00:00:23,890
Can you do better?
