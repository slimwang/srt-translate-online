00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,190
So let's wrap up our discussion for today and

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,070
also wrap up the foundational unit of our course as a whole. We started off

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,240
today by revisiting this notion of Cognitive architectures that we talked about

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,990
at the very beginning of the course. We use that to contextual our discussion of

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,290
Production systems, specifically those implemented in a framework called SOAR.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,550
As we saw, production systems enable action selection.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,020
They help us map percepts in the world into actions. Of course,

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,620
this is only one of the many things that a production system can do.

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,090
It can really map any kind of antecedent into any kind of consequent. But

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,259
in our example, we saw how the production system for

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:36,170
a pitcher can map percepts from a baseball game into pitch selection.

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,440
We then talked about impasses and how when a production system hits an impasse,

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,250
it can use chunking to learn a new rule to overcome that impasse.

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,280
This is the first time we've encountered learning in our course, but

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,130
learning is actually going to be foundational to everything we talk about from

16
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,990
here on. This wraps up the fundamentals unit of our course.

17
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,730
Next time we're going to talk about frames,

18
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,560
which we actually saw a little bit of today. Frames are going to become

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,220
a knowledge representation that we'll use throughout the rest of our course.
