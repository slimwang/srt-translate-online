00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:03,859
So,let's make sure we understand BFS and the problem that we're going to solve.

2
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:08,618
If we have a graph, an arbitrary graph with n nodes, what is the minimum possible

3
00:00:08,618 --> 00:00:13,364
maximum depth of that graph, and what is the maximum possible maximum depth of that graph?

4
00:00:13,364 --> 00:00:17,016
And by that I mean we can draw any graph we want, okay?

5
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:21,891
And we would like to draw it to minimize the biggest number that we write in here.

6
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:25,402
Or we'd like to draw a different graph with N nodes and we'd like to

7
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:28,125
maximize the biggest number that we write in here.

8
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,560
So, I'd like you to express these as functions of N.
