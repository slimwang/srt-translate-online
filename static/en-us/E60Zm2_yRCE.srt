00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,730
Before we begin, we should take
a moment to discuss API usage limits.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,220
It is important to Google that
developers have access to

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,190
as much capacity as they
need to be successful.

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,130
And so, usage of the Google Places API
for Android is free and unlimited for

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,180
all apps.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,640
However, to ensure fair use by all apps,

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,900
there are tiered query
limits on some methods.

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:26,080
The Places API enforces a default limit
of 1000 requests per 24 hour period.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,890
There's another checkpoint when your
average is 150,000 requests per day.

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,980
If you exceed either of these
thresholds, your app may start to fail,

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,430
as further API calls are denied.

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,340
So to avoid this,

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,800
we have a simple review process in
place to be granted a higher limit.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,070
Instructions on this review process can
be found in the documentation linked,

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,250
in the instructor notes below.

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,680
But because of these usage limits,

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,530
in order to use the API,
you will need an Android API Key.

18
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,640
If you fail to provide this, you may
notice that the Place Picker widget will

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,925
launch, and then immediately close.

20
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:58,450
It's an interesting
error to try to debug.

21
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,500
So to get properly configured, and

22
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,670
create your API Key, you need to return
to the Google Developer console.
