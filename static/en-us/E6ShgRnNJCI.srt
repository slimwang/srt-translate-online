00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,110
I need this for 16 because 4 times 4 is 16, 5 times 5 is 25. This one had an

2
00:00:05,122 --> 00:00:10,565
area of 20. 5 times 4 is 20. This bottom side is the same as this top side, so I

3
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:15,890
should have 4 times 4 or 16, and then for over here, I have four for this piece,

4
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:21,080
and four for this piece, 5 for this piece, and 5 for this piece. 4 times 5 is

5
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:20,907
20.
