00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,108
>> For the first point we know it's 0,20 so here's 0 and then I go up 20, so

2
00:00:05,108 --> 00:00:10,594
this one is on our line. The next point is 1,22. I notice that this box is at

3
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:16,309
1,24 so this can't be right. If I drive 2 miles, I pay $24, 2 miles and $24, so

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:22,375
this is on our line. If I drive 3 miles, I pay $26. $26 would be halfway between

5
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:28,557
24 and 28. So it'd be right here. So this point and this point don't satisfy our

6
00:00:28,557 --> 00:00:34,390
equation. If I drive 4 miles, I pay $28. So this one is correct. If I were to

7
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:40,798
drive 5 miles, I would have to pay two more dollars so, 30. But this point has a

8
00:00:40,798 --> 00:00:46,802
y value of 32, and I know if I drive 5 miles, I only pay $30. So, this isn't on

9
00:00:46,802 --> 00:00:52,946
our graph. And, finally if I 6 six miles, I know I would have to pay $32. So,

10
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:55,093
this point is on our graph.
