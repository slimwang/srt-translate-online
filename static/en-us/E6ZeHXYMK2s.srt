1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Once we have printed out our current information, we read a command, we're going to define

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
appropriate function input command for that and then we're going to invoke a function named debug

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
with the command with the current argument and with all local variables.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We have our debug function--return a value named resume.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If resume is false, we stay in this current event--that is we don't proceed in our code,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and if resume is true, then we exit the loop, step out of our trace it function

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and then execute the next line in the program.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let me first come up with the debugging function.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It accesses the state of the debugger by these two global variables--stepping and breakpoint.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If the command we have entered as an argument, then this should be a space between the command

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and the argument and we get the argument by splitting the entire string,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
getting the second element in the resulting list, which is the argument.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Otherwise, the argument is just none.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now, we can check what the command actually is and what it should do.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
For instance, if we say s or any command that starts with s and want to step to the program,

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
so what we do is we set stepping to true such that in the next line the program will stop again

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and we return true such that after stepping,

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
execution resumes and actually goes to the next line.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We can now add more commands--for instance, continue here which sets the stepping variable

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
to false and still ask the debugger to resume.
