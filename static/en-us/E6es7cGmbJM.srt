1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,270
Right so this should be
a relatively simple example,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,680
very tiny little example,
but it may be challenging.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,100
So here's what's going to happen.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,820
We are in a little four-room museum, and

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,930
we're interested in together
exploring the museum, but

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,650
the first thing we have to do is
actually end up in the same place.

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,600
So we each know what state,
we are in state four by the way, but you

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,800
don't know which state the other person
is in, you know where I am for example.

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,770
I know where I am, but
I don't know where you are.

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,990
We win if we end up in the same state
you can go basically north, south, east,

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,580
west or stay put, and if we're going to
move simultaneously, if I turn ends,

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,950
and we're both in the same
place we win okay.

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,560
>> So normally you would have to issue
these commands into the environment.

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,940
Right?
You walk around by yourself.

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,210
But you need to tell me what, what
you're going to do, so I can keep track.

16
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,730
>> Okay, and all I can do is move north,
south, east, and west?

17
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,750
>> Or you can stay put.

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,450
>> Or I can stay put?

19
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,370
>> Yeah
>> Okay.

20
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,480
>> And for

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,260
what it's worth in the DEC-POMDP model,
It's a planning problem.

22
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,120
So we can actually make
up a strategy in advance.

23
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,680
As long as we don't use it
as part of the strategy.

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,130
What state where, we're starting in,
because we don't know that.

25
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,210
>> So we can talk about
what our strategy would be?

26
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,160
>> Yeah.

27
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,378
>> Well I can think of sort of
three classes of strategies.

28
00:01:20,378 --> 00:01:23,060
>> Okay.
>> So one would be one of us decides

29
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,426
never were to move so that the let
the other person move around.

30
00:01:26,426 --> 00:01:28,810
>> Good.
>> That way we can't just miss it to

31
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:34,670
other right, and so I could not move or
you could not move right.

32
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,410
I should see those two separate things.

33
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,442
The other one would be we just agree on

34
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:45,350
a set of actions that we will take that

35
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,040
guarantee that we will
end up in the same state.

36
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,470
>> Well and maybe one way to do that is,

37
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,640
we'll pick out like a focal point will
pick a room that we should both go to.

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,980
>> Right, I was thinking three
because three is my favorite number.

39
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,710
>> Nice.

40
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,390
Okay.
So,

41
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,580
which of these strategies
do you suppose is better?

42
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,950
Well, It depends on exactly how rewards
and discount factors are defined.

43
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,990
>> Yeah, that's true.

44
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,160
But if we just think about cost somehow
being how long it takes us to get there.

45
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,529
>> Okay.
>> I actually guess.

46
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,950
Going to the same room is
probably the best one, because

47
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,980
no matter where you are long as you can
either take zero two steps to get there.

48
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,860
One step to get there or
two steps to get there.

49
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,580
>> Good, good I think you're right
actually, so let's do that so

50
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,920
we defer to sign in advance that we're
going to converge on room three.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,270
And you wake up, and

52
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,030
you find you're in room four to start,
but I don't know that.

53
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,260
But I know what room I'm in, and
now we both get to choose an action.

54
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,190
>> And I would choose the action left.

55
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,800
Assuming we aren't in the same room.

56
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,100
I would choose the actual left.

57
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,650
>> Okay.
All right, and

58
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,770
I will tell you that I
put you in room three.

59
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,450
and I take an action that is trying to
also move me towards room three, and

60
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,030
it worked.

61
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,738
>> We're both Room three.

62
00:02:56,738 --> 00:02:57,680
>> We're both there are three.

63
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,319
Hey what you want to see first.

64
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,584
>> Room three.

65
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:05,520
[LAUGH]
>> This is the Salvador Dali room.

66
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,100
>> Excellent.

67
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,050
>> All right, so this worked out
actually really well for us,

68
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,050
because you can imagine if this is
a much more complicated domain,

69
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,320
if there's a lot of stochasticity
if our task was more complicated.

70
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,640
It might be very difficult
to know what to do.

71
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,490
For example, what if you thought
you were in room four, but

72
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,310
you were actually in a room two.

73
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,730
And because you know partial
observable states being what they are.

74
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,580
So, you might not even know that
you're not in room three yet, and

75
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,970
it might be very difficult to get
there and know that you got there.

76
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,210
>> Well, I would hope that
there would be some room

77
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,470
>> Where we know whether

78
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,210
we're in that room or
not you never sure.

79
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,740
I dont know I mean whenever you do this
in a real museum right that's what you

80
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,020
do look just meet you at the entrance.

81
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,140
>> Well I thought it was
the Jurassic room, but

82
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,600
it was actually the Cretaceous room.

83
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,780
>> This is where pick an intruder
the entrance or something.

84
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,470
>> I see.

85
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,390
Yeah like a good focal of so
like one like the entrance.

86
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,600
>> No three was the answers as weapons.

87
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,280
>> All right.

88
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,820
Done and done.
