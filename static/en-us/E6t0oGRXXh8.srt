Hello. Welcome to the lesson on How to Solve Problems. Solving problems is one

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,254
of the most important skills you can learn. And calling it skill is really an

3
00:00:08,254 --> 00:00:11,920
understatement. Nearly everything you can do can be viewed as solving problems.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,334
And improving as a problem solver is a lifelong challenge. One short lesson is

5
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:19,296
not going to be enough to make anyone an expert problem solver. But for this

6
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:21,936
lesson, we're going to, to look at some aspects of how to approach more

7
00:00:21,936 --> 00:00:25,687
complicated programming problems. And hopefully, that will help you in solving

8
00:00:25,687 --> 00:00:29,561
any problem that you're faced with from now on. But it doesn't really make sense

9
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:33,177
to talk about solving problems without thinking about particular problems. So,

10
00:00:33,177 --> 00:00:36,622
we're going to look at a specific practice problem and talk about how I would go

11
00:00:36,622 --> 00:00:40,314
about solving that. And our goal by looking at a particular problem is not just

12
00:00:40,314 --> 00:00:44,142
to solve that particular problem, but to draw some general lessons about how we

13
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:46,453
can get better as problem solvers in general.
