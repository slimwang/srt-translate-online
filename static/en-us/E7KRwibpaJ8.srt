1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And this is how I solved the problem.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I assigned ta_300 to name + is the TA for

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
+ course for name, country, course in ta_data.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And, notice I had to use this country

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
even though it didn't show up here

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and that's because each of these lists contain 3 elements

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and I need to reference all three of those elements.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I only did this if course.find for this string CS3--

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
because you'll notice all of the 300 level classes

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
have CS3 in them--was not equal to negative one.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Because, remember, find returns negative one

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
when it doesn't find what you're asking for.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And when I run this, I get exactly what I want.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Good work.
