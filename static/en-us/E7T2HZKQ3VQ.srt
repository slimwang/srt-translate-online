1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,841
This vertical distance is about forty five and eight tenths of a centimeter.

2
00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:08,886
Nice problem solving if you got this correct.

3
00:00:08,886 --> 00:00:13,020
We'll find this vertical leg by using 
the Pythagorean theorem.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,032
We know the horizontal distance are one leg
of the triangle is twenty units.

5
00:00:18,032 --> 00:00:21,394
And we know the length of a string is fifty units.

6
00:00:21,394 --> 00:00:23,932
Now our units are centimeters

7
00:00:23,932 --> 00:00:26,910
but I'm just leaving it out as we work 
through the problem.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,775
We want to make sure we add that back in

9
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:30,644
when we get to our answer.

10
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:32,677
So twenty squared equals four hundred

11
00:00:32,677 --> 00:00:36,547
and fifty squared equals two thousand five hundred.

12
00:00:36,547 --> 00:00:40,032
Then we'll subtract four hundred from both sides of our equation

13
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:43,674
to get b squared equals two thousand one hundred.

14
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:46,135
We'll take the square root of both sides of the equation

15
00:00:46,135 --> 00:00:47,888
indicating plus or minus.

16
00:00:47,888 --> 00:00:50,282
But we'll only use the positive root

17
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:52,561
in the sense that we have a distance.

18
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:56,970
In this case b is about forty five and eighty two hundredths

19
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,802
Round it to the nearest tenth

20
00:00:58,802 --> 00:01:01,722
we'll have forty five and eight tenths.

21
00:01:01,722 --> 00:01:03,505
We've been working in centimeters

22
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:07,144
so we'll report this answer in centimeters.
