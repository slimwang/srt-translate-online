1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,580
In the responsive images support course,

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,000
they tell you how to
use unicode characters.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,520
I believe it's like fontawesome.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,776
So you can take these icons and
link them, so

5
00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:15,000
you get a Facebook icon or
a Twitter icon that you can use.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,040
So if you want to add something special,

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,700
you can check out that course and
try to give that a shot if you want.

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,840
>> So,
this is the CSS Zen Garden web site.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,670
As you can see here,

10
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,110
there's all kinds of little things
you can choose from the side.

11
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,621
But if we go to view all designs here,

12
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:35,488
we can see that there's just tons of
just these amazing looking pages.

13
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:38,430
Let's go to this apothecary one.

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,238
I mean like,
just really well thought out designs,

15
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,530
really good use of font and spacing and
page breaks and things like that.

16
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,250
And this is all the same CSS as,
say, this page.

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,480
Or sorry, all the same content, [LAUGH]
not CSS obviously, all the same content.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,610
Two completely different pages,
two completely different styles, but

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,640
all of the same content and
just sort of this beautiful use of CSS.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,703
So if you're looking for inspiration
on what you want to do with your CSS or

21
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:16,280
your style, this is a great
page to look for some ideas.

22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,960
Some of it is very advanced,

23
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,650
so by no means do you have to
create something like this.

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,468
The people making these
tend to be like really

25
00:01:27,468 --> 00:01:30,960
well-established graphic designers.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,220
But I mean, you can just get some ideas
of some of the awesome things you

27
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,070
can do with CSS.

28
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,126
>> Can you recommend a good source
of copyright for your images?

29
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:44,680
That I do.

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,480
Look for
the word creative commons license.

31
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,350
A lot of people,
a lot of independent photographers,

32
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,410
they post free photos every day,
everywhere.

33
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,030
Just search for the word
creative commons license, photos.

34
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,270
Flickr has a whole set of great
photos that you can look on,

35
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,370
and there's a filter on Flickr for
creative commons license.

36
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:15,160
And if you don't want to use Flickr,
just use your favorite search engine.

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,150
And type creative commons license
images, and it will have a filter to

38
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,840
search by images and it will give
you all the creative commons images.

39
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,680
And those are all free to use, provided
that you give the author attribution.
