1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,490
Before we go on,
let me introduce myself.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,600
My name's Andy, and three years ago,
I couldn't code at all.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,450
Now I can, and
I want to tell you how that happened.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,040
I graduated from college in
2009 with a degree in physics.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,790
And I had no coding skill at all.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,300
And at the time, I was actually
pretty intimidated by programming.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,290
Even though I didn't start
learning to code until 2012,

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,560
these three years from 2009 to 2012,
are relevant to how I learned to code.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,300
Because it was during this time that
I was doing a lot of teaching and

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,380
a lot of learning about
how people learn.

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,110
And I learned something that would wind
up being incredibly important to me.

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,380
When I would eventually learn to code.

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,120
I learned that anyone
can learn anything.

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,460
Well, just about anyone can
learn just about anything.

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,160
But for the most part, this is true,

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,780
because even though everyone has
different backgrounds and experiences

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,120
when you get down to the level of
brains they're all very similar.

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,680
And our brain is also this
incredibly flexible thing.

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,519
By giving it the right input you
can actually change your brain and

20
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,510
make it do whatever you want.

21
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,996
But, that's enough about the brain.

22
00:01:08,996 --> 00:01:12,620
After three years of teaching and
learning, sometime in early February of

23
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,050
2012, I heard about this new
education company called Udacity.

24
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,640
That was actually what the logo
looked like at the time.

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,700
I didn't know much about it, but online
education sounded really interesting, so

26
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,420
I emailed someone who worked there.

27
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,860
Three days later,
I was on a plane to San Francisco.

28
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,570
It was very exciting.

29
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,490
But things at Udacity were
pretty chaotic back then, and

30
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,890
nobody had even told me
what my job would be,

31
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,460
though I assumed it had something to
do with education and maybe technology.

32
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,800
Either way,
February 15th was my first day of work,

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,510
and I would figure it out then.

34
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,000
That morning, I got dropped off at
our office, which, at the time,

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,388
was just Sebastian, who's our CEO.

36
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:50,050
It was his house.

37
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,920
So, I walk to the door, I still didn't
know what my role would be, but

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,430
that was going to change
in about 30 seconds.

39
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,690
I rang the bell and Sebastian answered.

40
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,870
Our conversation went
something like this.

41
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,740
He told me that I would be the assistant
instructor for the course he was making.

42
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,580
This was news to me, but
I was trying to play it cool.

43
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,330
So I asked him to remind me of
the title and then he told me.

44
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,400
The course was called CS373 How
to Program a Robotic Car.

45
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,800
And I was terrified.

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,080
I didn't know anything about
programming or robotics.

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,850
And I might have quit right then,
if I hadn't remembered that lesson.

48
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,830
And because I really believe
that anyone can learn anything,

49
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,400
I started learning and
I haven't stopped.

50
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,410
And now, here I am today.

51
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,730
Very, very excited to be assembling
the resource I wish I had had

52
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,940
three years ago.

53
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,250
Now, you may be thinking, why should
I entrust my programming education

54
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,730
to someone who only has
three years of experience?

55
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,020
And the answer is,
you shouldn't and you aren't.

56
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,730
Let me explain how this
nanodegree is going to work.
