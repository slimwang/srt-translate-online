00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now I want to ask you one quiz question.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What if we wanted to return or to print all values of the filled-in formula

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
rather than just the first one?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
For some of these formulas there are multiple possibilities of digits to fill in

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that would all work equally well.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If we wanted to see them all, if we wanted to have them all printed out, what should we do?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Should we change the function fill-in to return a list rather than generate results?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Should we change the single word "return" to "print" in the function solve?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Should we change the function valid to do something else to validate

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
each of these possible formulas?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Or do we need to add a new function to do something that we haven't done before?
