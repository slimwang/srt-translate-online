00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hope you enjoyed the last unit. You guys have been doing great.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You've been doing amazing work, getting a lot done,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
doing a really good job of answering the questions.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I've been looking at this book here.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is a book from my father's collection.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's called "Introduction to the Theory of Games" by McKinsey.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It was published in 1952,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
4 years before the start of artificial intelligence.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And so game theory and AI have kind of grown up together.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
They've taken different paths,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and now they've begun to merge back together.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We've talked about games already in a previous unit.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We talked about mostly turn-taking games

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
where 1 player moves and then another moves,

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and the trick is how to work against an adversary

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
who's trying to maximize his own utility

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and thus minimize your utility.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Game theory handles those types of games, but it also really focuses

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
on games where the 2 moves are simultaneous,

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
or another way to think about them is 1 player moves

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and then the other moves, but the second player doesn't know

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
what choice the first player made, so it's partially observable.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And it's this back and forth of trying to figure out what should I move

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
given what I think he's going to move and what does he think about

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
what I'm going to move that gives game theory its special status.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We're going to talk about how that works for AI,

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and 2 problems are studied.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The first is agent design.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That is, given a game, find the optimal policy.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And the second is mechanism design.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That is, given utility functions,

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
how can we design a mechanism so that

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
when the agents act rationally the global utility will be maximized in some way?

35
00:01:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's take a look.
