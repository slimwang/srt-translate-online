Let's see if a similar sort of reduction happens with another rational

2
00:00:03,123 --> 00:00:07,986
function. How about we play with this one? F of x equals x squared minus 1 over

3
00:00:07,986 --> 00:00:13,640
2 times x squared minus 3x plus 2. How would you factor the numerator and the

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,816
denominator of this function? Please just factor for now. No cancelling

5
00:00:17,816 --> 00:00:18,849
anything out yet.
