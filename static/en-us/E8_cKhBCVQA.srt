00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,910
Inter-domain routing concerns routing between

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,810
domains or autonomous systems. It involves

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,720
the reconfiguration of the border gateway

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,280
protocol, policies or configurations that are

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,730
running on individual routers in the network. Changing BGP policies at these

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:25,440
edge routers can cause routers inside an autonomous system to direct

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:32,380
traffic to or away from certain edge links. We can also change the set of egress

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:38,310
links for a particular destination. For example, an operator of autonomous

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,880
system one might observe. Traffic to destination

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,160
D traversing the green path. But by

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,550
adjusting B to B policies, the operator might balance load across these two edge

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,780
links, or shift all of the traffic for

13
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,340
that destination. To the lower path. An operator might

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,290
wish to use inter domain traffic engineering if

15
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,720
an edge link is congested, if a link is

16
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,420
upgraded, or if there's some violation of appearing

17
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,000
agreement. For example, AS1 and AS2 have an agreement

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,270
that they only send a certain amount of traffic

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,520
load. Over that link in a particular time window.

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,810
If the load exceeds that amount, an operator would need to

21
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,040
use BGP to shift traffic from one [INAUDIBLE] link to another.
