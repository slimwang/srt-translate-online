00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,050
In this lesson we talked about
distributed shared memory systems, and

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,430
about the mechanisms they use in order
to manage that distributed state.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,780
We talked about coherence mechanisms,

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,100
we talked about consistency models that
are meaningful in those environments,.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,540
As a final reminder, note again

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,810
that all of what we talked about was
in the context of memory management.

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,940
These types of methods apply to other
applications that are responsible for

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,800
managing distributed and shared state.
