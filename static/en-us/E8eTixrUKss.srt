Now that we know we need to subtract 3 from both sides, what does x equal? We

2
00:00:04,452 --> 00:00:09,275
saw already, from simplifying expressions, that subtracting 3 from the left side

3
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:13,690
is going to get x by itself. But how does this affect the right side? Please

4
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:18,055
fill in this box right here with just one number that you think the right hand

00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:18,922
side should be equal to now.
