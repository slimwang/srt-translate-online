00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,627
Remember, a problem with histograms which you learned in lesson two. We

2
00:00:04,627 --> 00:00:09,923
sacrifice detail for convenience. Because of these bins, we can't determine the

3
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:15,062
proportional values less than or greater than certain numbers. We want to know

4
00:00:15,062 --> 00:00:20,002
things like this, though, to see how certain scores compare to other scores in

5
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:25,221
the distribution. So what will allow us more detail? Adding more values to the

6
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:28,989
data set, increasing the bin size, or a smaller bin size?
