1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,650
So what are the challenges that we're
going to face when we have this

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,510
task of managing cyber security for the
organization that we're talking about?

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,780
We said we have to know what
are the assets that are of value and

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,390
are they under risk?

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,980
Also, sort of understand the threats.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,168
And, how serious are those threats?

7
00:00:20,168 --> 00:00:24,945
So when we talk about risk, actually
we're going to look at this a little bit

8
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:28,965
more, but risk is really
the likelihood of an attack, okay?

9
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:30,810
So probability of an attack.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,910
It's not the worst case but
the worst can happen.

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,110
It's sort of trying to compute
the likely case in some sense.

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:43,495
So continuing with the challenges,
even if I sort of identify my assets and

13
00:00:43,495 --> 00:00:46,805
threat source, and
perhaps the likelihood of attacks,

14
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:50,970
then I have to worry about,
well what can I do about it?

15
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:56,247
What sort of solutions are out there or
controls that exist?

16
00:00:56,247 --> 00:00:58,970
Deciding that of course is a challenge.

17
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,250
We did talk about cost-benefit and
the trade off that are there

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,290
when you think about
the deploying various solutions.

19
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,220
So, of course we want to do
into a cost effective manner.

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,230
It sounds simple, but doing that,
again, is a serious challenge.

21
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,720
Obviously we have to argue
that the cost is less than

22
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,875
the reduction in risk
we're going to have.

23
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:24,265
Finally, we know that when you look
at sort of the threat landscape, and

24
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:26,905
I think in the context
of database security,

25
00:01:26,905 --> 00:01:30,417
we did the question where we said,
what are the threats?

26
00:01:30,417 --> 00:01:34,542
External hackers or insiders,
and we say in one of the surveys,

27
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:39,312
insiders and unauthorized access was
ranked higher than external hackers.

28
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:44,332
So we have to of course, understand
the people and the process that we have.
