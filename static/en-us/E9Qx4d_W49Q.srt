00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,490
We saw that Access Control is
a fundamental requirement for

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,689
computer systems that protect resources.

00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:10,080
We started with the Access

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,860
how we can implement using

We also explored how operating
systems implement Access Control
