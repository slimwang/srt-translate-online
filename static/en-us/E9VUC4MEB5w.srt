00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,430
Here's the scenario. We've obtained access to a file belonging

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,110
to some enemy, and we want to do some sabotage.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,410
The files stores a table of key value pairs, both

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,900
of them ints, and the whole file is in binary.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,600
It just goes key, value, key, value, key, value, all

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,180
the way through. Your task is to write a program

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,430
that will change the value associated with a particular key.

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,300
So the perimeters to your program will be file name,

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,660
the key who's value we want to change, and the new value we want

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,190
to associate with that key. Now our

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,230
enemies engineers weren't very clever. So the

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,080
keys in the file are in no particular order. You just have to search

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,058
there. Consult the man pages for open,

14
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:41,860
read, write, Lseek, and close. And Good luck.
