1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,843
This line goes 3 units up for every unit that it goes to the right. If we look

2
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:11,548
at this point right here, for example, and we step 1 unit to the right, we need

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:17,165
to count up 1, 2, 3 units before we hit the graph again. We can draw a right

4
00:00:17,177 --> 00:00:22,229
triangle going over 1 and up 3. This then, is the slope of this line.
