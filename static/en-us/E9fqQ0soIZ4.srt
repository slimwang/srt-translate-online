1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,850
Lets look at an example of
using variable reduction.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,089
Say we are analyzing an employee
survey where the employee has to rate

3
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:11,890
with the response from one to seven,
the following questions.

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,990
My boss treats me with consideration.

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,250
My boss gives me recognition
when I do a good job.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,350
My boss consults me when there
are decisions to be made about my work.

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,260
Now, in reality,
these are all similar and

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:33,149
could probably be categorized as
employee satisfaction with supervisor.

9
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,310
An analyst could choose
to leave them all in,

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,829
but again, if they're already dealing
with a number of other variables,

11
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:43,210
it might make it simpler to
just have a single variable

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,770
that captures most of the variance in
the response of these three variables.

13
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,609
Again, much easier to communicate
the concept of employee satisfaction

14
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:55,939
than to identify each
questions results separately.

15
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,370
One negative aspect to variable
reduction is that while it does reduce

16
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:05,670
the number of variables in the analysis,
depending on the method used in

17
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,590
the data, it can make the interpretation
of the model more difficult.

18
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,870
If the variables you are combining
aren't necessarily related, for

19
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,810
example, population totals and
income levels,

20
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,560
the component variables that
are created might be hard to explain.

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,900
It's a good practice to try
to use variable reduction

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,780
when the variables are somewhat related.

23
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,040
We see this in the example data we built
out in the exercise from the previous

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,230
lesson.

25
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:41,520
We have 12 months each of temperature,
snowfall, rain and precipitation data.

26
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,959
I wouldn't want to use variable
reduction methods to combine all 48

27
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,786
variables at once, but it would make
sense to create component variables for

28
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:53,510
each category of climate.

29
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:57,939
This way, snowfall is kept
separate from temperature.

30
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:02,280
So, as an analyst, you need to weight
the benefit you can get from reducing

31
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,810
the number of variables you use in
the clustering analysis, with the all

32
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,500
important aspect of needing to be able
to explain the basis for the clusters
