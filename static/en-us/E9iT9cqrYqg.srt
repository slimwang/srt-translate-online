00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,428
We've been working with quadratic inequalities and clearly linear inequalities

2
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:08,588
before that, but a lot of the techniques that we've learned to use can actually

3
00:00:08,588 --> 00:00:12,685
be used in a number of other kinds of situations too. Now we're going to take a

4
00:00:12,685 --> 00:00:16,781
second to talk about rational inequalities, which are things like this, for

5
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:21,023
example. The quantity 2x minus 18 divided by the quantity x minus 4 is greater

6
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:25,533
than or equal to 0. The reason this is called a rational inequality is because

7
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:30,157
the left side over here is an example of a rational expression. Remember when we

8
00:00:30,157 --> 00:00:34,573
talked about rational numbers early Julie pointed out that the word ratio is

9
00:00:34,573 --> 00:00:38,846
inside the word rational. So while a rational number is just the ratio of 2

10
00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:43,062
integers. We will remember the denominator is not allowed to be 0, and rational

11
00:00:43,062 --> 00:00:46,787
expression seems to be pretty closely related. It's just the ratio of two

12
00:00:46,787 --> 00:00:50,722
polynomials. And like with rational numbers, the denominator is not equal to

13
00:00:50,722 --> 00:00:51,070
zero.
