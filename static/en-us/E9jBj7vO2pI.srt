00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,300
In lesson 3,
we looked at text field customization.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,190
We created delegate objects which
implemented the protocol that

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,080
the UI text field class
was designed to use.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,640
In this lesson,
we're going to look at table views.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,560
And, you'll see that they're more
complex, but that their architected

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,690
in a similar way, just like text views,
table views use delegates.

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,430
Both view classes need view controllers
to implement delegate protocols,

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,750
in order to invoke
the methods they need.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,580
Methods that would be inappropriate
to implement inside of view class.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,370
Again, with tables, you'll see that
we can customize UI kit views by

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,910
implementing their protocol
methods in our own way.
