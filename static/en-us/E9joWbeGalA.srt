Responsive patterns are quickly
evolving, but there are a handful of

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,160
established patterns that work well,
across pretty much any device.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,046
Most patterns used by responsive web
pages can be categorized into one of

4
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:18,830
four patterns, mostly fluid, column
drop, layout shifter, and off canvas.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,200
In some cases, a page may use
a combination of patterns.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,110
For example, column drop and off canvas.

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,270

00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,610
the examples moving forward, the colored
boxes represent areas of content.

00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,540
Let's break them down one by one.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,630
I'm going to show you how these
patterns work, and then using your

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,860
Flexbox skills and media queries, you're
going to practice implementing them.
