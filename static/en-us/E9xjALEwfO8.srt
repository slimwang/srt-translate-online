1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,890
In the developer console,
when you create a billing account,

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,410
there are a number of steps
that you need to go through.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,993
The first is to name the account.

4
00:00:06,993 --> 00:00:09,071
And then later on when you're
creating your project,

5
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:11,068
you'll pick the billing
account based on its name.

6
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:13,368
Then you have to specify the country for
the account and

7
00:00:13,368 --> 00:00:15,110
where the account resides.

8
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,190
Payer details are going to
be linked to this country.

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,560
So be sure to pick the right one.

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,280
Then you just pick the account type.

11
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,390
You might be paying as a business or
you might be paying as an individual.

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,280
You just pick which one.

13
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,290
Next comes the payer details.

14
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,124
And that's just the name and
address of the payer.

15
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:33,050
And then finally there's
the payment type.

16
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,220
And this is going to be a credit card or
bank details.

17
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,850
And depending on which one you pick,
you have to configure it.

18
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,730
It's as simple as that.

19
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,230
Once you've filled out this form with
all of these details and submit it,

20
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,830
it will take a few moments.

21
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,260
But then billing will be available and
you'll be able to create a project and

22
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,200
select the billing profile
that you've just set up.
