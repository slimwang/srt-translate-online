1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,170
So, how well does it work?

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:07,170
Well, here's a nice example of finding both the telephone and the shoe.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,720
So here is the original phone and here you can see the outline.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,990
And here are the modest number I don't know one, two, I don't know.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,010
About 15 key points that have been matched.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,600
Now remember, you only need three to find the affine, so by finding more than

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,190
three, you get a much more robust solution to the transform.

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,800
Likewise, see so here we have our green shoe and

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,060
here you can see where it's found.

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,750
And again, you can find the set of feature points, key points,

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,050
that were matched.

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,320
But's also pretty cool.

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,660
I only need to find three points from one object in the corresponding place, and

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,080
then I can predict where the rest of them go.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,720
So that means, I don't have to see the whole object.

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,470
So here you see an example.

17
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,360
Here is the shoe.

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,370
I'm going to draw inside so you can see this right.

19
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:59,570
But you'll notice it's being occluded by this box of whatever the groceries are.

20
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,500
Okay.

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,790
Only the front part and the back part of the shoe were found.

22
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,010
All right, but I only needed three matches to find an affine transform, so

23
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,070
I didn't have to see the whole shoe.

24
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,250
I only had to see enough of it to do what's called the alignment.

25
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,300
Same thing is true of this telephone here.

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,380
The whole back end of the telephone is missing, but

27
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,950
we're able to recognize it by just finding features within the front part.

28
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,949
That's pretty impressive robustness with respect to occlusion.

29
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,660
Here's another one.

30
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,060
Now you can see the again, David had this thing about teddy bears,

31
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,920
shoes, and telephones.

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,090
I'm not exactly sure why.

33
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,140
Anyway here you can see the shoes behind the teddy bear,

34
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,740
only the front part is visible but you can see it.

35
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,520
Same thing with the phone.

36
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,310
So the idea is that as long as I can find these,

37
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,139
a small number of these local matches, I'm able to do the recognition.

38
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,840
oh, and here's one you, you saw before.

39
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,720
Remember the, the, the totem poles?

40
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,490
He's at UBC, University of British Columbia.

41
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,870
They got a lot of Native American, Indian stuff up there, so

42
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,920
I'm guessing that's what this is.

43
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,740
And you remember the thing just works.
