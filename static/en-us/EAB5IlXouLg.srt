00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,930
Just to recall again, let's take our favorite panorama image.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,980
We want to be able to take an image like this and again,

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,620
there are lots of images, in this case the panorama was scanned this way.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,610
And what we want to do is basically find, to generate a novel image

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,060
the pixels from one image and the overlapping image beneath it and

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,390
give you best possible pixel value within it.

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,020
Today, we're going to look at another method to do that.

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,850
This basically shows the example where blending can be done to

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,960
generate a novel image like this.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,880
And with the right proper thing, you get a beautiful image like this.

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,350
In a past lecture, we had looked at how to do this by cross fading different

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,190
images, and looked at different sizes.

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,610
If I looked at the whole size here by putting two images on top of each other,

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,520
doing some sort of a cross-fade.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,580
I get a little bit of a ghostly artifact, I can do this for

16
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,300
a smaller window and I get the artifacts right here.

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,820
Or you want a smaller window.

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,430
And we looked at various methods to actually figure out how to use the frequency

19
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,740
information to look at the size of these types of windows.

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,610
But when we do any type of pixel and pixel merging from one to the other,

21
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,570
you will always have some ghostly artifacts.
