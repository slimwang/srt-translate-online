1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,800
We've talked about a few
different things so

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,320
far like market segmentation and
personas.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,920
And I know you're a startup, so
you just want to get to the bottom line.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,410
So where do you start?

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,530
What do you do first?

6
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,790
Well, let's talk to an expert.

7
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,280
What does Moore have to say about this?

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,180
>> As a startup, I think it's best
to start with persona and I think

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,360
the persona is the target customer
with a compelling reason to buy.

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,600
And then I think as you start to
engage them with that persona.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,030
And so you put out your app or
you put out your downloadable thing, and

12
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,770
you're hoping this
persona will download.

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,720
Your communication,

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,770
you use pictures that you hope
look like the person you want.

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,150
And you say things you
hope they want to hear.

16
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,050
And then you start seeing how
well they engage with you.

17
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,170
And sometimes as you watch them engage,
you realize, I have the wrong persona.

18
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,530
This thing is actually getting traction,
but

19
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,360
it's getting traction with
a different group of people.

20
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,420
So you say okay,
well now maybe that's my persona, right?

21
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,090
So you have to be willing to move.

22
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,680
I think when you start getting
quantitative around the discipline of

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,070
segmentation is when you want to scale.

24
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,802
When you start scaling and you start
saying, I'm going to actually make

25
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:09,997
significant marketing,
I'm going to raise capital somehow.

26
00:01:09,997 --> 00:01:12,540
And I'm going to spend
that money on marketing.

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,490
Now you need to have a more

28
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,080
analytical approach to where
you're targeting that money.

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,160
But the beginning I think
it's much more qualitative.
