1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:01,595
Materials are cool.

2
00:00:01,595 --> 00:00:04,890
[LAUGH] And we've seen how we can
change the color of objects using them.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,750
But what if we wanted to stretch
an image across an object?

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,810
For example,

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,660
what if we want to put a photo of
ourselves in a 3D picture frame?

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,340
We'd have to use textures.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,875
Textures are images that get
stretched around meshes.

8
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:25,801
They're used for adjusting many
different elements of a 3D model.

9
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:30,322
Like color, transparency,
depth, shininess,

10
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:35,270
metalness, light emission,
and many more.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,100
Textures are a very important
part of creating materials.

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,720
Let's play with some.
