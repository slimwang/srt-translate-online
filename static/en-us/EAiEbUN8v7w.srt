00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,700
In the last video we saw how we
can take string literals and

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,250
combine them with integer literals
using the concatenation operator.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,670
This expression evaluates to the string,
I need two cups of coffee on Monday.

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,740
The powerful thing about concatenating
different parts of the text together

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,080
is that you can swap out different
parts if they need to change.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,450
For example, the number of
cups of coffee might change so

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,270
instead of a literal value here,
we can change it to be a variable.

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,850
Now I've removed the two and
replaced it with a quantity variable, so

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,680
when we evaluate this expression,

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,600
we'll always get the latest
value of the quantity variable.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,130
If the variable is holding the value 2,

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,780
then it'll pronounce something like,
I need 2 cups of coffee on Monday.

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,260
So these parts of the string stay
constant and they don't change,

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,490
whereas the quantity is free to change
and will always get the latest value.

15
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,730
I'm going to try it
out in Android Studio.

16
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,950
Since quantity happens to be
a variable that we already have

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,710
declared in the MainActivity, I can just
use it directly in submitOrder method.

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,319
I'm going to make up a string
like Total Item Count, and

19
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,910
then add quantity, and then coffees.

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,500
This isn't really related to price, but

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,490
I just want to show you that you can
concatenate strings with variables.

22
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,930
Let's run this to see
what it looks like.

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,640
If I change the quantity and

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,670
then hit the order button then it
shows total item count, 3 coffees.

25
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,600
I forgot to add the space right
after the 3, but before coffees, so

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,610
we should go and add that in.

27
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:34,000
I am going to add a space here so that
it appears right after the quantity.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,740
Notice that quantity here
is not in double quotes,

29
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,770
if it was then it would literally
show quantity on the screen, but

30
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,700
we want the value of this variable so
we don't put it in quotes.

31
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,240
Now that it has an extra space
here let's try to run it and

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,090
make sure it's correct.

33
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,900
Now when I change the quantity to 3 and
hit the Order button it says,

34
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,340
Total Item Count 3 coffees.

35
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,930
It correctly has a space before and
after the quantity value.

36
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:01,710
Taking a step back, when you look at
this line of code it can be a little

37
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,650
overwhelming because there's quotation
marks everywhere and plus signs and

38
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,720
spaces in weird places.

39
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,080
Just imagine that the plus
signs disappear and

40
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,470
everything in the quotes
gets squished together and

41
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,150
that the quantity variable gets
replaced with an actual value.

42
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,450
Because it's not that easy to read,
it's common to have mistakes here.

43
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,050
You might miss an opening or
closing quotation or

44
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,060
put the plus in the wrong place or
accidentally put a variable in quotes.

45
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,800
Just read through your code carefully to
make sure it's doing what you expect.

46
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,720
You can also do math expressions.

47
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,630
You can have quantity times five
in parentheses and this will

48
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,110
turn into a single integer value and
that will get concatenated to Price.

49
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,470
A string plus an integer turns into
a string and that gets stored in

50
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,570
the variable priceMessage and
that gets displayed on the screen.

51
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,610
When I run this on my device
It shows up as Price 15.

52
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,140
If you want the dollar sign or
the currency symbol to show up,

53
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,370
you need to make it part of
the string literal, like this.

54
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,940
The integer only holds the number part,
not the currency symbol.

55
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,718
If I run this on my device and

56
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:11,560
then hit the Order button,
now I see the currency symbol.

57
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,490
Following the pattern that I've
been showing you, go ahead and

58
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,410
modify the submitOrder method so

59
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,710
you can practice displaying
different messages on the screen.

60
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,670
First, try to display Amount Due
$10 on the screen when you

61
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,329
hit the Order button.

62
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,430
Once you get that working,
then change it so

63
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,350
that you display this string
when you hit the order button.

64
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,740
Repeat the same for
each of these different strings.

65
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,610
You should only see one of these
strings on the screen at one time.

66
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,295
Remember to concatenate
the strings with variables so

67
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:44,755
that the quantity and price values are
accurate based on the quantity picker.

68
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:48,285
So, if I change this to quantity
of five cups of coffee,

69
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:51,714
then the amount due should be $25.
