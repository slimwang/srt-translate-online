1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,890
Now that we have a derived feature x, before we go on to making

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:11,020
kernel density estimates let's look at a simple histogram, of this feature x.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,553
Let's switch to our [INAUDIBLE] in this block off code here,

4
00:00:15,553 --> 00:00:19,750
in the [INAUDIBLE] we have defined the variable x.

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,860
We're going to bend it between 0 and 1 with 100 bins.

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,450
We're not going to normalize it, so we can look at the number of entries.

7
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,630
Let's run this piece of code.

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,880
Once the code has finished running,

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,640
you will see a histogram that looks like this.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,587
This is our variable of interest x.

11
00:00:42,227 --> 00:00:45,090
It ranges between 0 and 1.

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,500
It also has two definite peaks.

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,310
One at the value of zero, the other between 0.8 and 1.

14
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,420
Somewhere around 0.89 or 9.

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,570
Notice that we had two variables in our model, but

16
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,140
we have changed that to a single variable x,

17
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,840
which is a combination derived from the two variables here.

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,910
This will let us use a single variable kernel density estimate,

19
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,899
to build a model of x.

20
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,960
Form the derived variable corresponding to x, for the state of California.

21
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,570
Name it y.

22
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,840
Once you're done click on this box.
