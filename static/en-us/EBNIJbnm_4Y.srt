1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:06,429
The solution set includes negative 3, negative 1, positive 3 and positive 1.

2
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:12,228
Four separate answers. Great work if you found these four. And keep in mind, we

3
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:16,450
should have these four answers, since we have a 4 for our highest power. We can

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:22,019
make the substitution u to equal m squared. We know this since m squared

5
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:27,757
squared equals m to the fourth. This lets us have a power of two here and a

6
00:00:27,757 --> 00:00:33,725
power of 1 here on the us. Next, we factor this quadratic expression to get u

7
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:38,870
minus 9 times u minus 1. We set each of these factors equal to zero to get u

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,457
equals 9 and u equals positive 1. Now we're ready to go back and find the

9
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:48,701
original values for m. We use u equals 9 and u equals 1 from the two solutions

10
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:54,375
we found from factoring. We know u really equals m squared. So for this u,

11
00:00:54,375 --> 00:01:00,846
we'll have m squared equals 9 and for this u, we'll have m squared equals 1. We

12
00:01:00,846 --> 00:01:05,000
want to solve for m, so we take the square root of both sides of the equations.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,712
So here we'll have m equals plus or minus 3 and here we'll have m equal to plus

14
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:15,402
or minus 1. So we'll have negative 3, positive 3, negative 1 and positive 1 as

15
00:01:15,402 --> 00:01:17,310
our solution set.
