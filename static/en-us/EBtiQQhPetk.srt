00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,038
We saw before that this absolute value function, g of x, equals 3 times the

2
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:07,998
absolute value of x minus 2, does not have an inverse when we consider the

3
00:00:07,998 --> 00:00:14,975
entire domain, all the real numbers. But maybe if we apply some restrictions to

4
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:19,676
the domain, we can make this function have an inverse. Considering each of

5
00:00:19,676 --> 00:00:23,456
these choices on its own, which of them would make the function g pass the

6
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:27,882
horizontal line test? Please note, that if you pick more than one choice here,

7
00:00:27,882 --> 00:00:30,486
that doesn't mean that we have to use both of those parts of the domain at the

8
00:00:30,486 --> 00:00:34,659
same time. We're just looking at these one by one.
