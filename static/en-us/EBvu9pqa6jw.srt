00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,270
So how about we try modifying the greedy vertex cover algorithm.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,840
Remember, the greedy approximation algorithm is that while not edges are covered,

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:13,580
we choose a vertex has the most uncovered edges and we put that vertex into the vertex cover.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,910
So we're going to modify this by also picking up random edge each time we go through this loop

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:24,100
and picking one of that edges endpoints at random and adding that endpoint to the vertex cover.

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,350
Now, what I'd like to know is does this algorithm perform as well as a

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,030
factor 2 approximation algorithm or maybe does it perform even better.

8
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,820
Now, I'd like you to do is go to the forums and provide a proof that does,

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,300
or if it doesn't, then provide a counter example--provide a graph that it doesn't perform as well

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,380
as the factor 2 approximation algorithm on.

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,180
So it could be either one, and I'd really like all of you to discuss this and see what it proves

12
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,280
or counter examples you come up with.

13
00:00:51,280 --> 99:59:59,999
So when you've done that, go ahead and post to the forums and then check this box.
