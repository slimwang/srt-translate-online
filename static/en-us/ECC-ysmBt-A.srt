1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,610
And the correct answer
is hardware pixels.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:09,990
This mobile device has 1920 pixels going
across horizontally in landscape mode,

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,520
and 1080 pixels going
vertically in landscape mode.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,450
And these are the actual
physical pixels on the device.
