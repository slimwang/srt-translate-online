1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,928
Well the answer again is log N.

2
00:00:01,928 --> 00:00:05,421
Just like in the previous step, we're doubling the hop count on each step

3
00:00:05,421 --> 00:00:08,678
so it will take log N steps to fill in all output positions,

4
00:00:08,678 --> 00:00:12,315
and if you count both awake and asleep threads as doing 1 unit of work each iteration,

5
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:15,007
we do N log N work overall.

6
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:20,488
The big idea here is that this entire algorithm is a good example of trading off work for steps.

7
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:23,526
We do more work than the serial version, N log N versus N,

8
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:26,846
but we finish in fewer steps, log N versus N.
