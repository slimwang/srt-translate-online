1
00:00:00,171 --> 00:00:03,943
The problem with everything that I just showed you,

2
00:00:03,943 --> 00:00:07,554
is it would be very difficult to turn it into code.

3
00:00:07,554 --> 00:00:08,820
Why do I mean that?

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,710
What I mean is, I've been showing you everything in terms of geometry, right?

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,380
I'm like waving my hands, and we've got points, etcetera, whatever.

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,230
Computers don't do so

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,820
well with, waving hands and, despite what my undergraduates say.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,200
Okay?

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,980
What we need to do is we need to go from the geometry, to algebra.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,640
Because believe it or

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,440
not, computers are fine for algebra as long as you know what you're doing.

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,540
That is, you can convert, algebraic expressions into computations.

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,240
In fact, we talked about that earlier.

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,390
But, it's very hard to go from geometry to computation.

15
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,440
And the way we're going to do that,

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,600
is we're going to take the geometry and then convert that to algebra.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,620
So we're going to start off, today with a pair of calibrated cameras.

18
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,890
Okay, so here's my pair of calibrated cameras.

19
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,590
I have two camera centers, Oc, and Oc prime,

20
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,100
and they're both looking at some world point, X.

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,530
And it's viewed in the two images, and it's seen here.

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,190
Because these are calibrated cameras,

23
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:09,600
I'm going to assume that I know the translation T, along the baseline.

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,200
It. Sorry T is the vector that is the baseline right so,

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,960
if I have to shift you know, two, seven, nine.

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,230
To get from one camera to the other in XYZ, that's what my translation would be.

27
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,930
And I also know R, I know the rotation matrix though, you would have to

28
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,920
rotate one camera center to become aligned with the other camera center.

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,220
That's what it means to be calibrated.

30
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,360
So we write this, this way, okay?

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,860
It says from geometry to algebra, we're not quite there but, but

32
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,910
we're almost there.

33
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,670
But basically what we're saying is,

34
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,050
the location of the point X in the prime frame, can be expressed by

35
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:49,740
rotating X as appearing in the non prime frame and then translating it by T.

36
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,470
That's just the equations we had before.

37
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,990
I know this is not the homogenous version, it's okay,

38
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,180
in a minute we'll make everything beautiful.
