00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,592
Let's zoom in here a little bit. We know that 95% of sample means will be within

2
00:00:06,592 --> 00:00:13,017
two standard deviations from the mean. Most likely, this sample mean here is one

3
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:18,624
of the 95% that will fall within two standard deviations of the new sampling

4
00:00:18,624 --> 00:00:24,643
distribution, if everyone used the Bieber Tweeter. So, in other words we have

5
00:00:24,643 --> 00:00:31,271
this new predicted population mean. We'll call it mu sub BT for Bieber Tweeter.

6
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:36,131
Our best guess for this is 40, but it'll be within an interval around 40, most

7
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:42,531
likely. And we know that 95% of sample means, just of people who use the Beaver

8
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:49,894
Tweeter, will be within this interval. Well, most likely, this is one of those

9
00:00:49,894 --> 00:00:55,250
95%. Let's assume that this is in that interval. If this sample mean is indeed

10
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:01,583
within this interval, then what could the population mean be? Well, if 40 is in

11
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:09,464
this interval, we know 40 has to be greater than this but smaller than this. Do

12
00:01:09,464 --> 00:01:14,646
you remember how to solve inequalities like this? So, we're trying to solve for

13
00:01:14,646 --> 00:01:19,041
the population mean. So, let's subtract it from all three sides of this

14
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:26,226
inequality. If we do that, then these cancel and these cancel. So, we're left

15
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:32,434
with negative 2 times the standard error is less than 40 minus the population

16
00:01:32,434 --> 00:01:38,326
mean is less than positive 2 times the standard error. Now, I'll subtract 40

17
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:43,813
from all three sides of the equation. So, here, we get negative 40. And now, the

18
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:49,222
last thing we need to do is to make this positive. So, we'll multiply by

19
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:54,580
negative one on all 3 sides. When we multiply or divide by a negative number,

20
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:00,842
these inequalities go the opposite way. When we multiply this by negative one,

21
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:07,802
we get positive 40 plus 2 times sigma over root n is greater than positive

22
00:02:07,802 --> 00:02:15,418
population mean is greater than positive 40 minus 2 times the standard error.

23
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:21,328
And now, we have this gorgeous interval. So, let's recap really quick. We know

24
00:02:21,328 --> 00:02:28,786
that 95% of sample means will fall within two standard errors of the population

25
00:02:28,786 --> 00:02:34,768
mean. We're guessing that the sample mean we have is one of those 95% that falls

26
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:40,506
within this interval. And if that's the case, we're pretty sure that the

27
00:02:40,506 --> 00:02:46,458
population mean, then is between this sample mean plus or minus 2 times the

28
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,833
standard error.
