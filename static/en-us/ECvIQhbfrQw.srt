00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
The last part about human resources are qualified employees

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,890
and the culture you set for your company.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,400
Qualified employees are the difference between a good idea

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,710
that never went anywhere and a billion dollar firm.

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,330
It gets a million times but it's very true.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,040
A employees in a B market will always win over B employees in an A market.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,450
Hopefully, your A employees in an A market and you'll be figuring out where

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,290
to put the bags of money, but you want to always hire people better than you,

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,650
and if that's threatening to you as a founder or if that's threatening to any of your employees,

10
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,070
the system kind of collapses from there.

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,880
You want people who actually can see farther than you or have skills deeper than you,

12
00:00:40,880 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's the sign of a world-class founder.
