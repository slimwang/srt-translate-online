00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,984
For a hyperbola that is not centered at the origin, we can use h comma k as its

2
00:00:03,984 --> 00:00:10,190
center. This actually gives us two equations for hyperbolas. This equation has

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,885
the x squared term coming first. So the parabola will open to the left and to

4
00:00:14,885 --> 00:00:20,338
the right. H and k will be our center. And the value of a will be how many

5
00:00:20,338 --> 00:00:24,666
units we move in the x directions. And the value of b will be how many units we

6
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:29,468
move in the y direction. This allows us to graph our ellipse, and then draw the

7
00:00:29,468 --> 00:00:34,550
box around it for our rectangle. Other hyperbolas however open up and down.

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:39,948
These hyperbolas start with the y squared term. This term will be positive

9
00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:44,604
instead of being negative. But notice that h and k have been switched here. H

10
00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:50,486
is still with x and k is still with y. But k comes first in this equation and h

11
00:00:50,486 --> 00:00:54,796
comes second. So, you want to keep this mind when finding the center if the

12
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:59,358
hyperbola opens up and down. The h value will be this value and the k value

13
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:04,063
will be this one. This might be confusing but you can always remember that

14
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:08,625
anything associated with the x direction will be with the variable. For

15
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:13,482
example, the x coordinate of the center will be h. That's with the x. And the

16
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:18,530
way we move in the x direction, a will be here. Underneath the x squared term.

17
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,630
Likewise, anything having to do with the y or the y direction will be next to

18
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,734
the y variable. The y coordinate of the center k is here, and the way we move

19
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:32,504
vertically up and down, the value of b is here. These equations aren't that

20
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:36,230
different. And really the things with a squared and b squared work exactly the

21
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,891
same as before. The only difference is that this hyperbola opens left and right

22
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:44,859
since the x squared comes first and this parabola opens up and down since the y

23
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:51,910
squared term comes first and is positive. The other subtle difference is hk.

24
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:56,711
Here they're in order, h and then k. Here we need to be careful and get the h

25
00:01:56,711 --> 00:02:00,980
next to the x. And then get the k that's with the y.
