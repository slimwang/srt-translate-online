1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,080
So just the nomenclature that
we're going to use here, and

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,900
this is taken directly
from the rosetal paper.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,000
We have a couple things.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,050
First of all, there's the actual state,
and they use L for

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,740
location, but L is not,
maybe not just be the position.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,620
It might also be the scale,
rotation, etc.

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,070
And then they've got an observation
that's called F, and

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,890
you know why it's called F?

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,650
Because what we were actually
tracking were faces.

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,050
But just think of it as the observation,

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,670
we're actually talking about
them as being Zs previously.

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,100
So the goal is to predict
the target location

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,400
based upon our last belief about where
it was and our current new measurements,

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,740
and in fact, what we need to be able
to evaluate is this probability of

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:51,290
the location given my last
belief plus my new measurement.

16
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,950
Now, we've done this before, right?

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,240
We've said that this equation was
made up of two components, and

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,650
we'll just copy them back up here.

19
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:03,450
The two components are the,
we'll do the purple one first,

20
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,390
that's just our dynamics model.

21
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,390
That says, if I know where
thing was at time T minus one,

22
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,200
what's my belief about where
it might be at time T?

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,400
Now in their work here, they used, the
fancy word for it is Brownian motion.

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,180
For those of you remember,

25
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,090
that's little particles just vibrating
around doing whatever they want.

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,040
Another way of thinking about it is,
they don't have a velocity model.

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,720
They basically say, if something is
here In the next frame it's going to be

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,460
somewhere around here and
maybe rotated a little bit, and

29
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,360
it doesn't remember
anything about velocity.

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,470
So, it's just based upon position.

31
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,080
But the new part that's kind of cool
here is this observation model.

32
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,550
This observation model
is the probability

33
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,620
of the observation given the,
the state, given the location.

34
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,930
And what they're going to do there is
they're going to use that eigenbasis

35
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,790
approximation.

36
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,590
So what that means is, I'm going to say,
if I can reconstruct this patch

37
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,940
well from my basis set,
that's going to be a high probability.

38
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,130
And if I can't reconstruct it well,
that's going to be a low probability.

39
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,810
That's fundamentally the observation
model that they're going to use.
