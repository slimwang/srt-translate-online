00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,960
Hopefully, once your app is
launched on the Google Play store,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,840
you will have lots of users who
will use your app constantly.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,110
So if you've got Analytics enabled,
then every time a user does

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,580
anything with your app,
a hit will be sent to Analytics.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,500
But now you might start worrying about
impact on performance and battery drain

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,210
from sending all these outbound requests
over the network so frequently.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,660
Because every outbound request
needs to wake up the battery.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,670
Relax, you don't need to
worry about battery drain,

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,750
because the engineers at Google
already worried about it for you.

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,540
They designed the Google analytics
class to batch up requests,

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,310
to reduce pings to the battery,
which means adding analytics to your app

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,020
has a minimal effect on performance and
battery usage.

13
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,340
Android devices have a central analytics
service, that's shared by all apps.

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,230
So when a user uses an app,

15
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:58,590
that app sends a hit request
to the analytic service.

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,800
This is not an outbound
request over the network, so

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,110
the radio receiver and
the battery are not involved.

18
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,630
So the analytics services collects
the hits from all the apps and

19
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,660
batches them up, and sends them
together in two minute intervals

20
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,450
With the maximum hit of 20 per batch.

21
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,680
It's only this batched request
that goes out over the network.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,280
The analytics service takes
care of sending the hit

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,310
at intervals that don't have
too much impact on the battery.
