1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,880
The IPsec header has an IPsec sequence
number designed to prevent replay.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:13,170
It is used only if Is used, or the
authentication option in ESP is used.

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,400
A sliding window of size n,
which should be at least 32, is used.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,110
That is, although packets
may arrive out of order,

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,180
the sequence numbers should be
within the window of size n.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,860
More specifically, when a packet
arrives, if its sequence number is

7
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:36,070
smaller than the smallest number
of the window, it is rejected.

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,220
If the number is greater than
the largest sequence number

9
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,230
of the sliding window,
then the packet is accepted, and

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,850
the window it advances
to discover this number.

11
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,670
If the sequence number
falls in the window,

12
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,200
it is checked to see if the sequence
number have been seen before.

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,510
If yes, it is also rejected.

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,520
If not, it is accepted and the number
is recorded as having been seen.

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,920
That's how we reject duplicate packets.
