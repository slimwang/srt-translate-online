00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,090
Next, we're going to write a kitten class that

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,390
calculates the cuteness based on a kitten's age. We'll

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,680
say that kittens over six months old are

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,860
cute. We'll say that kittens between two and six

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,900
months, including exactly two months and exactly six

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,380
months, are super cute. And kittens under two months

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,260
old are not quite cute yet. They're still too

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,340
young and sort of look like aliens. There's some

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,670
code for the kitten class to get you

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,440
started. You should implement the get cuteness method
