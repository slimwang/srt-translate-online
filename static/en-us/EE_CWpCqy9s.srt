1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,690
The second way how clouds
are commonly differentiated is based

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,740
on the service model they provide.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,920
Here's a great image that depicted
the differences between the different

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,170
service models.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,780
Without the use of cloud computing,
you run your application on premise, and

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,550
that means you have to take care of all
of these different layers yourself.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,850
You manage them personally.

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,240
The applications, the data, the runtime,
middleware, O/S, so different

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,000
components of the software stack
including the virtualization technology.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,750
And then the lower level, all of
the components of the hardware stack.

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:40,810
In the other extreme, you can use cloud
computing services and then directly

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,830
leverage the fact that cloud computing
can provide you with an application.

13
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,620
So this is a model called
software as a service.

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,850
And this resembles
what Gmail offers you.

15
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,990
You don't have to run your mail server,
install quotas,

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,350
manage security patches, etc., for
the employees in your company.

17
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,510
You can just force them to
use Gmail and, in fact,

18
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,520
can just contract Gmail to run
the email services for your company.

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,510
In the case of Gmail, everything
is run by Google in this case.

20
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,260
It's their hardware, it's their
software stack, system software.

21
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,460
They own and manage the data,
they run the application, configure it.

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,210
Update it, upgrade it and
everything else that's necessary.

23
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,110
So this is the software as a service,
or SaaS model.

24
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:36,030
A second model is where the cloud
service can provide you certain APIs

25
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,770
that you can access to develop
particular types of applications.

26
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,690
The cloud service provides
a development or execution environment.

27
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,150
And that includes the operating system,
various libraries, various tools that

28
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,290
are necessary for the applications
that need to run in that environment.

29
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,590
One example is the Google App Engine and

30
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,890
this is called platform as
a service offering, or PaaS.

31
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,100
In the case of the Google App Engine,

32
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,000
the platform as a service offering
is that it offers everything that's

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,660
necessary to develop applications for
Android platforms, for instance.

34
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,910
Windows Azure was originally purely
intended as a pass offering for

35
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,740
developing and running .NET
applications, and more recently

36
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,780
another type of extension was added to
the Windows Azure portfolio services.

37
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,600
Finally at the lowest level, clouds
can provide infrastructure instances,

38
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,537
like compute instances that consist of
the CPUs, or rather virtual CPUs with

39
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:44,170
accompanying memory, or
storage, or the necessary

40
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,870
network resource in order to form
a cluster of such compute instances.

41
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,180
Amazon's compute cloud is an example
of such an infrastructure as service

42
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,710
cloud computing model.

43
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,220
This can also include other types of
hardware resources, like GPUs, so

44
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,450
you can rent from Amazon
instances with GPUs for instance.

45
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,190
Again know that these types of clouds

46
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,020
don't really provide you with
the physical resources directly.

47
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,220
Instead, the resources are virtualized.

48
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,100
And so it may turn out that you
are using independently some subset of

49
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,830
the physical resources
available in that cloud system.

50
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,300
But it's quite possible and

51
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,030
likely that you're sharing
the resources with other tenants.

52
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,410
An exception to this is that,
in particular of the case of Amazon,

53
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,430
they do provide some high
performance instances.

54
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,840
So if you're renting through Amazon,
a cluster of VMs or

55
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,600
virtual cluster or virtual high
performance instance, you will in fact

56
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,350
end up at a virtual machine that runs
independently on physical hardware.

57
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,040
The same thing happens
when it comes to the GPUs.

58
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,740
Your GPUs won't be shared in this case.

59
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,270
But that's just because of some
technical challenges in terms of how to

60
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,900
get sufficient performance level
in a virtualized environment for

61
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,140
these high performance instances or GPU
enabled instances that Amazon provides.
