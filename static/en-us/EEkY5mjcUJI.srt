00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,800
The Wagon Pool app falls
responsive design principles, so

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,260
the app fits on different devices.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,620
The app also has a simple
user interface so

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,370
that all the features are intuitive and
easy to use.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,420
But Wagon Pool app doesn't
connect with an external server,

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,690
the only data that is
used is the user's input.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,150
And finally this app doesn't
utilize any mobile device hardware.

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,030
It doesn't connect with a camera or

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,590
a microphone,
because there's no need for it.

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,560
It's a simple calculator.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,860
Depending on the type of app you need
to create, you may end up using some or

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,370
all of these elements.

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,770
Let's read a little bit more about the
different types of mobile programming.
