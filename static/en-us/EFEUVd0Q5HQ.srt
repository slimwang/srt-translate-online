1
00:00:00,151 --> 00:00:03,131
Now before we finish,
I want to actually now showcase you, yet

2
00:00:03,131 --> 00:00:05,491
another example of similar
coded photography.

3
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:06,315
Except this time,

4
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:09,148
we're going to talk about the concept
of a flutter shutter camera.

5
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:12,025
The flutter shutter camera,
basically now attempts to do

6
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:15,610
the same thing the coded camera did,
except that this time around rather

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,389
than change the aperture, it wants to
change something about the shutter.

8
00:00:19,389 --> 00:00:22,964
In coded aperture,
we added obstructions to the aperture.

9
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:27,526
In flutter shutter, let's control
when the shutter opens and closes.

10
00:00:27,526 --> 00:00:32,125
So, you know, again have the whole thing
and just figure out how to open and

11
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,027
close it in a specific manner.

12
00:00:34,027 --> 00:00:36,709
Just to kind of look at this,
let's look at this series of examples.

13
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:39,833
A standard camera or traditional camera,
when it takes picture,

14
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,968
when the shutter is open,
you get one frame.

15
00:00:41,968 --> 00:00:42,502
Right?

16
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:46,330
And these are ideas come from this
Raskar et al 2006 paper that's

17
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,782
represented at the end and

18
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:51,151
also we'll provide you the links
where to look at in detail.

19
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,019
I do encourage you to look at these
papers to kind of get a good sense of

20
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:55,364
the exact technical details.

21
00:00:55,364 --> 00:00:59,824
I'm just summarizing them and giving you
the big overview of these concepts here.

22
00:00:59,824 --> 00:01:01,901
So, of course,
when I open the shutter like this.

23
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:06,016
And if the car is moving, what I would
basically get is the car is moved and

24
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:10,086
if I actually have the shutter,
you'd actually get some sort of blur.

25
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:12,245
A motion blur in this instance, right?

26
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:14,365
Let's look at it again.

27
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:18,431
When I open the shutter,
the car is moving.

28
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:21,474
And of course,
depending how long the shutter is open,

29
00:01:21,474 --> 00:01:23,433
I will get a blurry image like this.

30
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:25,269
Well, let's actually do
something interesting.

31
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:29,002
Let's actually change how
the shutter opens and

32
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:31,467
also control it when it closes.

33
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:34,398
So now basically what we'll do is
we'll open and close the shutter and

34
00:01:34,398 --> 00:01:35,948
this is basically showing you this.

35
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:39,931
Now, if I know exactly how this opens
and closes, this is interesting.

36
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:41,726
Now, I do get a motion blur image.

37
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:46,638
But if you notice this one has
a very specific sharp lines.

38
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:49,731
Let's look at them next to each other,
this was when the shutter was open

39
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:52,469
the whole time and this was when
we kind of flutter shuttered it,

40
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:54,567
that is opened and
closed it at different rates.

41
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:56,053
Here everything is blurred.

42
00:01:56,053 --> 00:01:59,014
In this one, you do see some blur.

43
00:01:59,014 --> 00:02:01,590
But actually,there is a little
bit of a better signature.

44
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,782
So you, for example, see these lines
at different you know, there's no,

45
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:07,768
of course, detail here whatsoever.

46
00:02:07,768 --> 00:02:11,875
But here, you actually see different
characteristic lines on this image.

47
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,954
This actually is much
more useful than this.

48
00:02:13,954 --> 00:02:18,125
And if I actually know this code, then
I actually know a lot more about this

49
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,293
image too and that's the basic idea.

50
00:02:20,293 --> 00:02:23,216
If I know the code on how and
when I open this,

51
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:27,878
I should be able to kind of use this
information to model the output that

52
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:32,007
I'm getting after all of this
is accumulated or integrated.

53
00:02:32,007 --> 00:02:36,119
Here I know all of it, but since I have
no control over how the aspects of what

54
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:38,752
happened in the middle
everything is blurred.

55
00:02:38,752 --> 00:02:42,554
So Raskar et al actually designed
this camera by actually just taking

56
00:02:42,554 --> 00:02:46,552
an existing camera and putting some
sort of a additional controller that

57
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:50,024
would basically change the control
of how the shutter opens and

58
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:52,081
closes with a digital process here.

59
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:55,601
So they actually, could actually
figure out the exact code on how the,

60
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:56,840
the shutter would open.

61
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,489
So they created this new
camera to do this and

62
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:00,148
they did a lot of other
experiments with it.

63
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:03,050
Again, I recommend you to look
at the paper for more details.
