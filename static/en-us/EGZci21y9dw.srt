1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,780
Now it's your turn.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,350
Let's move on to another more real-world example.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,980
Now, this right here is a groundbreaking new application called Udacity Retain.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,245
Aside from a snazzy name, it,

5
00:00:14,245 --> 00:00:19,370
it does have some pretty good organization when you look at the underlying code.

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:20,490
So let's do just that.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,727
We have an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file.

8
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:30,833
If you look at the JavaScript file, we see a pretty similar organization in

9
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,850
this app as we saw in our pizza application.

10
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,840
Now, we just spent some time going over the pizza application together

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,290
just a moment ago.

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:43,177
So, go ahead and clone this repo and get it onto your local machine.

13
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:46,950
Then take a look at it and try to figure out roughly how it's organized.

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,380
You will see some similarities between the pizza app and this app here.

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,225
Now, if you have a moment of disorientation, that's normal.

16
00:00:55,225 --> 00:00:57,190
Anytime I look at someone else's code for

17
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,155
the first time, it takes me a bit to get my bearings.

18
00:01:00,155 --> 00:01:00,750
[SOUND] So

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,033
don't worry if it takes you a few minutes to start understanding things.

20
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:09,640
Feel free to comment things out and see what breaks.

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,990
Add comments as you figure out what things do and notice the big picture.

22
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,620
Does the model ever talk to the view directly?

23
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,770
How about the view to the model?
