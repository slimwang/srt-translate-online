1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,617
These are three ways of symbolizing the alternative hypothesis. And in real

2
00:00:04,617 --> 00:00:09,630
terms, this is like saying, the intervention will make learners more engaged.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,438
In other words, the population parameter after the intervention will be greater

4
00:00:13,438 --> 00:00:17,861
than the current population parameter. Or it'll change how much learners are

5
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:22,790
engaged. Which is symbolized by this way of writing the alternative hypothesis,

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,947
or will make learners less engaged. Our next step is to decide which of these

7
00:00:27,947 --> 00:00:30,733
alternative hypotheses we want.
