1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,430
And the correct answer is we see two values in the URL,

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,050
the value we submitted and the value we hardcoded in our code.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,090
So let's take a quick look at this again.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,200
Recall that in our code, I added this extra input type hidden, name equals food,

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,300
which matches this name and the value eggs, hardcoded.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,000
And then in our browser, when I click steak, the URL updates to have both steak,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,020
the one we've just added, and eggs in the URL.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,340
Let's try a few more examples while we're here.

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,837
Let me try adding pizza.

10
00:00:31,837 --> 00:00:35,669
You can see steak, the one that came from us, changed to pizza, and

11
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,330
eggs remained.

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,950
Let's see also what happens if I type in eggs.

13
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,280
Now we get eggs twice.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,560
So you can see we always have the value that was in our hidden elements

15
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,810
in the URL and then what came from the user is also there.

16
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,730
But we can't add multiple things quite yet.

17
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,530
To be honest with you, I wasn't actually sure what was going to happen when I

18
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,900
was writing this lesson plan.

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,870
Just happened to work out in a, in a way that I could make a nice example.

20
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,580
And just goes to show you, you know, some of the stuff is a little tricky, but

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,610
it's very easy to just play around in your editor and

22
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,680
in your browser to actually, you know, see what happens.
