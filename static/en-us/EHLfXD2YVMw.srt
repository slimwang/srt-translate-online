00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,060
I am in a terminal. I am going to fire up

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,950
python and I am going to show you how to use python

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,280
to do hashing for you because we are going to be doing

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,870
a lot of this in this class. One thing we can use

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:14,260
is hashlib. Hashlib has a couple of hashes available to you.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,100
You have md5, shaw1, 256. Those are the ones that we just

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,220
talked about so let's go ahead and get the md5 of something.

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,380
The way we do that is we say. X equals hashlib.md5 and

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:26,970
we say.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,360
Now X is this hash object and the way we get something useful out of this is we

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,570
call the hex digest function on them. If we call hex digest on the result of

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,840
md5. We get this string. And this is the md5. Has of the string Fu.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,255
And if I were to change, let's do this all in one line. Let's say

14
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:55,360
hashlib.md5, hello, hello. Whoops, hello, hello,

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,360
and call Hex Digest on it. We can see our

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,560
hash. Now, if I were to just change one of

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,350
these characters, let's say it changed to a capital O

18
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,410
We can see our hash completely changes. See we had

19
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,440
f five two blah blah blah two six three here.

20
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,300
So that's a neat property of this particular hashing function

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,900
and if we were to change this back to hello

22
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,390
hello we get our original hash. What's nice about a hash

23
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,840
algorithm like M d five its available on every system and if I type if I you

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,730
know hash hello hello On any system with MD5,

25
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,230
we're going to get the same result. Thatâ€™s pretty cool.
