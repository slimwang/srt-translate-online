1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,580
You could say, well, instead of using small windows, use a slightly bigger

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,950
window, so this is question of, how should we pick the window size, and just

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,800
like when we were talking about scale, there's not going to be any easy answer.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,270
Here's an example of another stereo pair, I'm only showing you the left.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:21,950
So if I do a sliding window stereo, well, for a small window size,

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:29,060
well I, I get the branches pretty well, of the tree, but you'll notice

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,680
there is all this I think the technical word is crap, all over everywhere else.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,580
That is you know, this is a disparity image, and, and my ground should be

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,610
going from near to far, and there shouldn't be all this junk all over it.

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,950
So what do I do?

11
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,550
Well obviously, because of noise and

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,170
things, I need to make my window bigger to get a more robust match.

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,400
So if I make my window bigger, I get this nice ground pattern here, right,

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,580
you can see that it goes from near to far, okay, and

15
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,840
the trees back here are farther away.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,600
But notice what happens to the tree branches there.

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,100
Okay?

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,830
The window is too big, and when you put it over a branch,

19
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,110
it gets both the branch and the background, it doesn't know what to do.

20
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,495
Just as I said earlier in this course, scale is always an issue,

21
00:01:10,495 --> 00:01:11,610
there's no magic answer.
