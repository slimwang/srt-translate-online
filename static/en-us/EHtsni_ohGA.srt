00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,980
We just said that the amount of cleaner fluid that Grant needs is greater than

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,930
50 liters. So if we decide to call the amount of cleaner fluid x, then we'll

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,765
have x is greater than 50. How would you represent this inequality on this

4
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:16,074
number line? Notice that the 50 hash mark is right here, and I've put a question

5
00:00:16,074 --> 00:00:20,429
mark on that to indicate that you need to pick which of these symbols belongs at

6
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:25,301
the 50 mark. Then also please tell me, which side of the number line we should

7
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:25,928
shade in.
