1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,210
That's it.

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,400
You can build a simple
convnets with just this.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,630
Stack up you convolutions, which
thankfully you don't have to implement

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,450
yourselves, then use trieds to
to reduce the dimensional ID and

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,200
increase the depth of your network,
layer after layer.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,890
And once you have a deep and
narrow representation,

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,330
connect the whole thing to a few
regular fully connected layers and

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,420
you're ready to train your classifier.

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,630
You might wonder what
happens to training,

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:30,070
into the chain rule in particular,
when you use shared weights like this.

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,220
Nothing really happens.

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,920
The math just works.

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,580
You just add up the derivates from all
of the possible locations on the image.
