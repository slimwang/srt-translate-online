00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,549
Now let's do a little performance analysis here.

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:07,958
Let's say that we have 32 adjacent threads in a warp that are each processing a separate row in the matrix.

3
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:10,204
These rows may be different lengths.

4
00:00:10,204 --> 00:00:13,995
Will the overall run time of this set of threads be dependent on

5
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:18,027
the shortest row, the average row, or the longest row?
