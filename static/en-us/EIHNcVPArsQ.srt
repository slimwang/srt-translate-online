00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,310
As an example, here's my blog, circa an embarassingly

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,670
short time ago. Now, if you resize this window,

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,270
nothing really changes. Nothing adjusts other than

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,730
the amount of margin space. It's really

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,380
a fixed width layout. Now, let's take a look at this on the phone.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,340
Now here, I get a very different version of my

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,430
blog. It fits well on the phone, but I'm only

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,490
getting this because my blog is running on Wordpress. And,

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,680
Wordpress is configured to give a totally different version to phones.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,050
But, that's not actually what I want. Because I really

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,370
want to have a shared layout between the two. Let's

12
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,900
take a look at this on a intermediate device. My

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,390
seven inch Android tablet. Now here, what I'm getting is essentially

14
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,080
the desktop version. I can still scroll through the

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,340
site but you can tell all the text is pretty

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,560
small. Although interestingly, if I rotate to landscape mode,

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,200
it adapts. Now why does it do that? Well it

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,860
turns out it's our old friend viewport. There's now

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,230
viewport set in this page. So, what does that mean?

20
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,890
Does layout happen if the device flipped? Or does layout

21
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,460
happen at the magic 980 pixel width and then get

22
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,030
rescaled to fit on the screen?
