00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For this question, we're just going to discuss threat models and the one-time pad from Unit 1.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In order to know that a one-time pad provides confidentiality,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which of these do we need to assume about the adversary?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Is it necessary that an attacker has limited computational power?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Is it necessary that the attacker doesn't know anything about the key?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Or it is necessary that the attacker cannot modify the message?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that apply.
