1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
The correct answer is the setupTo

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,350
AutoLayout Constraints. Because the Record

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,109
button has an intrinsic size.

4
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:08,760
I've used the edge of the button and the trailing

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,440
margin of the view to set up a

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,170
constraint in the x-axis. And I’ve also

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,179
used the bottom of the Record button in

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,220
the Bottom Layout Guide to set up a

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,990
constraint for the y coordinate in the y axis.

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,840
You can use different constraints

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,560
than this,

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,779
as long as you have one for the x-axis

13
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:31,160
and one for the y-axis
