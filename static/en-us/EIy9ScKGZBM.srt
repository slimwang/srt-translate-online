1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,710
Alright, when doing the order of operations, I'm going to start within any

2
00:00:03,722 --> 00:00:07,694
parentheses I have. I need to simplify this container. So I'm going to leave the

3
00:00:07,705 --> 00:00:11,598
3 on the outside. Now I have 4 times 2 cubed or 4 times 2 to the 3rd. I know I

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,425
have a choice. This 2 could go with multiplication or with exponents, the power.

5
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:20,702
I know it should go with the power, because powers take priority. So I have 4

6
00:00:20,714 --> 00:00:24,987
times, 2 cubed is really 2 times 2 times 2, or 8 minus 20 times 2. Okay.

7
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:29,550
Let's keep going with simplifying this parentheses. I have 3 on the outside.

8
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:34,246
Now, with this 8, I have a choice. It could be paired with multiplication or

9
00:00:34,258 --> 00:00:38,976
subtraction. I know multiplication comes first. So I'm going to have 32 minus 20

10
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:43,404
times 2. I do this multiplication before I do this subtraction. My parentheses

11
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:47,438
is getting smaller which is good. Now the next choice I have to make is with the

12
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,229
20. Should it go with the multiplication or with subtraction? I know that

13
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:55,219
multiplication comes first before addition or subtraction. So I have 3 on the

14
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:59,334
outside, 32 minus 40. We're almost done, 32 minus 40 I know that's negative 8 so

15
00:00:59,346 --> 00:01:03,343
I have 3 on the outside times negative 8. Alright if you have trouble with this

16
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:08,079
part here's what you can do. Remember, subtraction is the same thing as adding

17
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:12,834
the opposite. I could have 32 plus negative 40. Subtracting positive 40 is the

18
00:01:12,846 --> 00:01:17,547
same thing as adding negative 40. When I think about these two numbers, I know

19
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:21,858
40 is more negative, so I'm going to have 8 more negatives than 32. So I get

20
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,621
negative 8. And 3 times negative 8 is negative 24. If you got negative 24, nice

21
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:26,914
work.
