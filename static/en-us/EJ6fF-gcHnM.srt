1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,680
The reason that this volume doesn't work is because it's giving us a negative

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,565
value. For a quantity that we should be able to touch and feel, it's tangible.

3
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:13,345
And length and areas and volumes are usually positive. Let's see if we can

4
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:17,440
figure out why by using a real piece of paper again. After all, this is the

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,480
right size, so maybe if we try to make this box, we'll figure out what's going

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,132
wrong. Here's my ruler and my piece of paper and I'm going to measure in three

7
00:00:27,132 --> 00:00:31,508
inches from each side and then in the other direction as well. Okay, so there's

8
00:00:31,508 --> 00:00:35,942
one of the squares we should draw. Now let's draw the other three. Two squares,

9
00:00:35,942 --> 00:00:40,386
and now potentially for the tricky ones. So here's the issue we have when I

10
00:00:40,386 --> 00:00:44,810
tried to draw my boxes for the corners that I want to cut out. This length right

11
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:49,284
here is 3 inches, or x, the length of the square that I want to cut out. But you

12
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:53,631
can see that if I started to cut here, and actually cut down the whole length,

13
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:57,909
right there, I'm already cutting into an area that's supposed to be part of

14
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:01,894
another square that I'm going to, to cut out. This is a major issue. I'm not

15
00:01:01,894 --> 00:01:05,798
going to have enough flaps left, or enough material left if I cut out all of

16
00:01:05,798 --> 00:01:10,977
this. In fact, let's just do it to see what happens. Now I just have this strip

17
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:15,212
of paper and I can't make a box out of this.There are no flaps. I guess this has

18
00:01:15,212 --> 00:01:19,646
something to do with what's going on. So for our 5 inch by 7 inch piece of

19
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:25,278
paper, what value must x, the cut length, not exceed in order for us to still be

20
00:01:25,278 --> 00:01:30,670
able to have flaps that we can fold up and make this into a box? Just think back

21
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,940
on what the problem was before with the 3 in cut length, and use your common

22
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,044
sense. This is kind of a riddle. So, just think through and take your time.
