1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,610
While I was working as a Fire Chief,
working hard around

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,800
cardiac arrest survival, training
people in CPR in our community and

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,370
putting AEDs in the community,
but I was out to lunch one day.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,300
I heard a siren in the distance.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,060
It grew louder and ended up pulling
right in front of a deli where I was

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,590
eating, that's when I learned that
somebody right next door had suffered

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,660
a cardiac arrest, and I wasn't aware
of that until that ambulance got there.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,360
That event made me realize that
even though somebody's trained,

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,240
they're not always in the exact right
place and the exact right time, and

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,250
maybe we can bring technology in, where
firefighters are alerted with radios,

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,390
maybe we could use people's cell phones,
who are trained in CPR,

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,180
even our off duty professionals,

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,850
make them aware of the events that
they were close too but couldn't see.

14
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,020
We're crowdsourcing good Samaritans,

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,870
that's really the purpose
of the Pulse Point app.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,750
The solution that we have,
only can exist with a mobile app,

17
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,810
where you have push notifications,
you have location based services,

18
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:01,120
you have people carrying phones who
have the sophistication to do this.

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,300
We have an entirely
volunteer development team.

20
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,570
So Android being so widely adopted,

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,790
it's a platform when we put our
development time into that,

22
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,280
we know it's going to get into
the hands of a lot of users.

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,890
As a fire chief I didn't have app
developers, no programmers on my staff.

24
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,830
But we understood the problem very well.

25
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,810
So we ended up turning to a university,
NKU, Northern Kentucky University,

26
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,340
who had an app development school.

27
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,540
And we brought out
a number of interns and

28
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,550
sucked them up here in the Bay area,
and prototyped using interns.

29
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,640
Once we've proven the concept,
that's when we turned to deductial and

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,060
workday and they sort of helped
take the concept and make it real.

31
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,520
When you first load the application,
it shows you all the emergencies that

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,370
are happening around you,
not just cardiac arrests.

33
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,550
If you want to be notified
of cardiac arrests,

34
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:04,150
you just go into the setting screen and
you select the CPR notification.

35
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,130
Once you've done that, if a cardiac
arrest occurs within walking distance of

36
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,930
you, you'll be notified.

37
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,580
And you'll receive a map, and
it'll show you where you are,

38
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,350
where the patient's located, and
any nearby public access defibrillators.

39
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,160
The app also provides CPR instructions.

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,050
So reminders, and also a metronome

41
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,430
that can help you set the proper
cadence of your chest compressions.

42
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,800
You can't solve this
upfront on a white board.

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,120
It's a constant iteration,

44
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,370
learning from your users,
getting experience in the field.

45
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,670
And you have to be in the game.

46
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,320
You have to actually be solving
the problem to be able to learn enough

47
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,510
to make a difference.

48
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,700
We had somebody playing soccer,
at a local school,

49
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,740
collapse with cardiac arrest,
911 is called, and we have

50
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,150
an EMT who's home with his family that
lives across the street from the school.

51
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,280
Gets notified, just runs across the
street to do CPR, an event he would not

52
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,780
have been aware of but very close by,
and saved the gentleman's life.

53
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,790
So it's actually seeing the app save
lives, those are where you say,

54
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,390
we really made a difference
in these people's lives.

55
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,480
And we have so much potential to
do it again, and again, and again.
