00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,650
Welcome to lesson three. This'll be databases. Databases are

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,240
how you actually store all those information that we've

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,190
been collecting from users. This is basically the final

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,190
piece that'll allow us to build fully functional web applications,

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,380
and your homework for this lesson ought to be

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,870
actually build the first version of your blog. So. Databases

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,180
are actually quite complex. We can spend a lot

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,235
of time talking about them. You can actually get a

9
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:29,360
Ph.D in databases if you want. But, in this lesson, we

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,492
have about an hour, so we're going to divide it into

11
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:34,150
two parts. The first part of this lesson will talk about

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,760
SQL and kind of basic database technologies, a lot of things

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,310
you'll probably encounter outside of this course. And then, in the

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,000
second part of this lesson, we will talk about Google App

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,240
Engine's data store which abstracts away a lot of the headaches

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,410
of installing a database and getting it setup. It's actually the

17
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:55,410
reason we decided to use App Engine for this course, it was

18
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,280
the ease of getting started with databases, so let's dive right in.
