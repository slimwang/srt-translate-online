00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:05,626
What is the ratio between the amount of traffic incurred by Ben's implementation,

2
00:00:05,626 --> 00:00:08,302
versus your optimized implementation?

3
00:00:08,302 --> 00:00:10,063
Please fill in the blank here.

4
00:00:10,063 --> 00:00:12,700
Your answer does not have to be exact,

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,934
but it should be within 10% of the actual ratio.
