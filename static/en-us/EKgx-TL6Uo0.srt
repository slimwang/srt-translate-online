00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,280
For us,

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,090
query will be the most complex of
the required content provider methods.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,120
We've given you the bones,
of the query operation.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,970
As you can see,
we use our SURI nature object,

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,149
once again to switch on the type of URI.

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,220
Note that each response from this
function, will return a cursor that

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,740
corresponds to the incoming
query as defined by the URI.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,470
This is the only function where we
will have to fill out a different

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,000
response for every type of
URI in the content provider,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,360
as several of them
are used in queries only.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,520
At the bottom of our function, we're
going to set the notification URI for

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,370
our cursor to the one that
was passed into the function.

13
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,550
This causes the cursor to register
a content observer, to watch for

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,430
changes that happen to that URI and
any of its descendants.

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,020
This allows the content provider,
to easily tell the UI when the cursor

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,040
changes, on operations like
a database insert or update.

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,620
We'll see more on this later,
when we cover inserting and

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,300
updating the database.

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,840
Uncomment the test basic weather query
function within test provider and

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,600
run this code when you're finished, to
make sure all of this is working well.
