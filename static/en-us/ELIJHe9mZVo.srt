This is referred to as the Bayer to RGB demosaicing process.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,600
In this case we just take a four by four subset and use that simple math and

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,350
average to start to create an RGB triple.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,510
And that, of course, is the one that's to create those layers.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,780
There's a lot of literature on this kind of demosaicing.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,220
I encourage all of you to look it up,

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,340
and and kind of try to understand the whole process as needed.
