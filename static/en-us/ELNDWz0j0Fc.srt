1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,412
We need to make sure that x is greater than 0 inches. Now of course if x was

2
00:00:04,412 --> 00:00:09,110
equal to 0, then we just wouldn't have cut into the box at all. You would have

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,601
just a regular rectangle of paper. And this is physically possible, however

4
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:17,699
there are no flaps here to fold so it's not really our ideal situation. A

5
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,224
negative value, however, doesn't make any sense. After all, like we've seen many

6
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:26,433
times in different examples throughout this course, measuring negative lengths

7
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:31,767
is a pretty tricky thing to do. It doesn't make sense in this situation. So,

8
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:36,803
bottom line, if we want flaps, x must be greater than 0.
