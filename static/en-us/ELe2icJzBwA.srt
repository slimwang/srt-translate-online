1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,397
What we're looking for is the point of intersection between our line x equals 75

2
00:00:05,397 --> 00:00:10,686
and the line that corresponds to brand 1. So, we follow the teal line up until

3
00:00:10,686 --> 00:00:16,001
it intersects the purple line, which happens right here. We follow that over to

4
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:21,265
the y-axis. That point looks like it's halfway between this grid line and this

5
00:00:21,265 --> 00:00:27,056
grid line, or halfway between 800 and 900, if we count up from 500. So, it looks

6
00:00:27,056 --> 00:00:29,535
like Grant will pay $850.
