00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,090
An IDS can be deployed at
the perimeter of a network, or

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,640
subnet, to monitor traffic going in and
out of the network.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,550
Such an IDS is a network IDS.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,540
It typically uses
a packet capturing tool,

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,740
such as the libpcap tool to
obtain network traffic data.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,810
The packet data contains the complete
information about network connections.

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:29,050
For example, if a user connects to
a website using his browser, the packet

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,640
data will contain all the TCP handshake
information between the browser and

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,250
the web server, and all the URL
requests from the browser and

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,240
the return page contents
from the server.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,390
That is, by examining the packet data,

12
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,580
the IDS has all the data sent and
received by the user's browser.

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,480
If the user's machine is infected by
a bot malware, for example, any attempts

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,720
to connect to a website for command and
control, the network IDS will be able

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,790
to see that the traffic looks like
CNC activities and output an alert.
