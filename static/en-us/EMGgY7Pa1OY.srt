00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,630
The process we just went
through will repeat.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:07,370
But running Saga a second time will
create totally new execution context

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,190
instead of referencing
the original blue context.

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,540
This accommodates for
storage of different bindings.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,470
As ever, the interpreter's
lookup focus will also shift

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,320
into the newly created content.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,230
The var declaration creates
a new variable in this context.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,520
And if you like to think about the
storage layout that languages use for

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,670
your data, you could say that
this variable is stored in

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,640
a new distinct location
from the first one.

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,290
Now while this isn't necessarily
the case, it's likely true and

12
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,030
it's a useful way to think about it.

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,040
What values do you expect
to be logged by this line,

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,960
given the current in memory conditions
