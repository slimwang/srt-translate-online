For the first one, you should have a base of 4, since you have the repeated

2
00:00:04,154 --> 00:00:08,624
multiplication of 4. And you have it repeated one, two, three times. So, we have

3
00:00:08,636 --> 00:00:13,005
4 to the third. Here, we have repeated multiplication of 6. So, 6 is my base and

4
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:17,373
I have it repeated one, two, three, four, five times. Here, I just have one 7.

5
00:00:17,473 --> 00:00:21,817
So, I'm going to put 7 as my base. I don't have any repeated multiplication, I

6
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:26,437
just have the 7 once. So, my exponent is a 1. Here, I have the 3 as my base. And

7
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:31,500
I have the 3 repeated seven times, so 7 is my exponent. Nice work on that quiz.
