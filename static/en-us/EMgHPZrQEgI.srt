1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We can compute this using the formula for conditional probability.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this case what A is is the probability the coin toss is valid.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A is valid, and we know that the probability of A is equal to 0.99998.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What B is is the probability that it's heads.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So the probability of B is the probability of H, which is 0.49999.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now we just have to plug these into the formula.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But what we need to use the formula is the probability of A intersect B.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And what A is the probability of A intersect B. What A is is valid.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Instead of heads and tails, what B is is heads.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If we intersect heads and tails with heads, we get tails.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We know the probability of tails is 0.49999.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That means using the formula we have the probability of tails, which is 0.49999,

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
which is the probability of A intersect B.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We're dividing that by the probability of A,

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
which is a valid event which is 0.99998.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We get 0.5.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I should note that this is not the case for real coin tosses.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
There is no physical coin ever manufactured that has exactly

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
chances of landing on both sides.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
In fact, with real coin tosses, at least with American currency,

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
there is a much higher percentage--much higher meaning close to 51%

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
rather than 50%--that the coin lands on the same side that it started on.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
When we talk about mathematical coin tosses,

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
we're going to assume that there is no edge case

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and that it's equally likely

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
that we have a uniform distribution and there are only 2 outcomes.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
When we talk about mathematical coin tosses,

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
we're going to assume that we have a uniform distribution,

29
00:01:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and there are only two outcomes.
