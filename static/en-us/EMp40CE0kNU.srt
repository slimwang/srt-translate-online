1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now we have to introduce some extra constraints so that this truth assignment has to be satisfied.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And to do that, we're going to introduce a set of nodes

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
for each clause that is sometimes referred to as a gadget.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
These gadgets come up a lot in NP-completeness proofs.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In this case, it's going to be a little piece of a graph but it's going to be a little piece of a graph that has

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
particular mechanics to it that makes the graph act like a three-set problem.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
All right, now we're going to extend this graph by adding a gadget for each clause.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A gadget is going to be a little chunk of a graph but it's going to have very particular property to it

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that it's going to be three-colorable in the context to the rest of the graph

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
if and only if the corresponding clause is satisfiable in the context of the assignment.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So let's imagine that we've got, this is our clause (l₁, l₂, l₃).

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
All right, there's a couple different ways of making this gadget,

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Here's one that makes sense to me.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Essentially, these are going to be little triangles, that kind of correspond to or expressions

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and the or of l₁ and l₂ or'd with l₃ is going to give us the answer for the clause.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So, here's the sixth node.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
They're going to be connected to some of the nodes that are already in the graph.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
In particular, the three literals that are in that clause and the slack variable in the middle

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
slack node in the middle and false node off the side

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and just to simply things, remind you that false node is colored black, the slack node is colored red,

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and this literal nodes are either going to be blue or black each one.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And now, what I'd like to do is show you the different ways of coloring these

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
either allow the rest of this structure to be colored with three colors or not.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So let's start off with the case where all three of the literals are false.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's an important case because if the assignment is such

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
that the literals are all false then this clause it's not satisfied.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This clause is not satisfied so the whole formula is not satisfied.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So this is going to be important to make sure that this graph is not going to be colorful.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So given that these two nodes are connected to slack, neither of them can be red.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So this one in particular can either be blue or black.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If this one is color blue, then that means neither of this can be colored blue

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and neither of these can be colored black, so they have to be both colored red and that doesn't work.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So this can't be blue and it can't be red, so it has to be black.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This can either be blue or red, it doesn't matter which is which.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
All right, so now we have this node.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Well this node is kind of obvious, it's connected to red and black, so it has to be blue.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now this node is connected to blue and black, so it has to be red.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And this node is connected to red, blue, and black so we are in trouble.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So the graph was not colorable when these three literals are all black.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But if this literal is blue, well that means that one of the literals in clause is true,

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
so the whole clause should be true so this better be colorable.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay, by the same argument before, this is red and black so this one has to be blue as well.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So looks like we're okay.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We're able to assign colors to all these nodes so that none of the coloring constraints are violated.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So that's okay. So this one is blue and these guys are black.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Actually this one doesn't matter what it is, that thing is colorable.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So this could either be blue or black. What if this one was blue, that's going to be okay too.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We can just swap the two colors of these nodes.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
All right, so what that means is if this one is blue, the thing is colorable. Definitely.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So one of them is true, that's if this one is true, that's enough.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So let's consider the case where this one is black and one of the other guys is blue.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
All right, so this one is forced to be blue.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Since this one is black and this one is blue, this one is forced to be red,

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
which means this one's forced to be black which means this one's forced to be blue

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
and now we're in good shape because this one is black and this one is red

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and now we have a valid coloring, actually no matter what l₂ is colored.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
In the same argument where it's to be switched, which one of these two is blue?

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We can just swap these two colors and everything is fine. So what did we just show?

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So, this gadget for this clause is colorable as long as

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
the three literals it's connected to are not all black.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And that's great because that's exactly what the satisfiability condition is.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So we create one of these gadgets for each for each in the clauses

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
connect them to the rest of the graph and now we get this giant graph

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and that whole graph is satisfied, if and only all the gadgets can be colored,

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
which is the same as saying if and only all the clauses can be satisfied

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and since they're all connected with n, that's exactly what we wanted it to be.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So this graph that we built is colorable if and only the entire formula is satisfiable. That's kind of cool.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Right. So, even though a formula with boolean variables in it

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and a graph with different colors in it, feel like very different problems

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
in a very deep fundamental mathematical way, they're really the same problem.
