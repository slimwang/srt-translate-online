00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000

Try to see if you can think about the answer and find it yourself.

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Of course it's okay if you want to run the code in the Python interpreter as well,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but see if you can figure out the answer without doing that.
