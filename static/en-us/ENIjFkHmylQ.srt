00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,940
The correct answer here is viewWillAppear as this is

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,100
the method where we show and hide things on our phone.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,650
Now, if you look at our class, this method, viewWillAppear, does not exist yet.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,800
As I start typing it, however, Xcode actually autocompletes the method for

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,760
me and I can accept that autocomplete suggestion by hitting Enter.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,490
There. This method viewWillAppear is inherited from UIViewController, and

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,190
that is why this keyword override is used.

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,160
Now in here, I want to hide the stop button.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,960
To do this, I will need to access the stop button in the code somehow.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,290
And the way I can do that is by pressing Control on my keyboard and

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,910
creating an outlet at the top here.

12
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,910
I will call it stopButton and hit Connect.

13
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,568
Okay, I'm going to scroll up a little bit so we can see all of the code,

14
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:51,550
and inside viewWillAppear, I will hide the stop button.

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,560
Now, one last thing I want to do here is I want to make sure that

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,810
the stop button actually starts to show up when I press this microphone button.

17
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,550
So remember when I press this microphone button, this action gets called.

18
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,940
So in here, I'll say stopButton.hidden is equal to false.

19
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,240
Let me run this and see if it works.

20
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,860
All right, so when the app first launches, I do not see any stop button.

21
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,900
That is good.

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,200
When I click on this microphone, the stop button starts showing.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,720
That is great.
