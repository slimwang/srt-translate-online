00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Hope you took a few minutes to look over

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,658
the documentation for UIViewController.

3
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:06,059
Don't worry if it seems a bit strange for

4
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:08,339
now, you’ll know this class inside and out

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:10,230
by the end of this course.

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,119
I’ve added this function “viewWillAppear” to the

7
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:14,039
ViewController.swift class just for this quiz.

8
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:17,190
And here's a quick question to

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,320
test your knowledge. Which of these is

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,059
called first in the life cycle of a

11
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:24,809
UIViewController? Is it viewDidLoad or

12
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:30,169
viewWillAppear?
