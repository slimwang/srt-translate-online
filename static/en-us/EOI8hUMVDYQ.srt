1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,120
But what if we missed things going on between the samples,

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,250
what if we don't have enough dots?

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,655
All right.

4
00:00:08,655 --> 00:00:12,100
Well, not surprisingly something's getting lost, right,

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,830
some information is getting lost, right, so here we're showing you right so

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,380
I've got a dot here, I've got a dot here and there's all this change going on in

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,600
between, that is not realized or I should say not captured.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,810
Perhaps, the surprising result though, is that actually

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:34,780
this is indistinguishable from a lower frequency, okay, so

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,380
here what's drawn in is, this the same set of dots, that we had before, but

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,550
there's a low frequency sinusoid that fits through there, 'kay.

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,200
Continuing with that, with sort of a surprising result is that,

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:56,680
the low frequency that was always indistinguishable from those high frequencies,

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,020
if you only gave me a small number of dots.

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,790
Okay, that is, I can't tell, whether or not it's a high frequency or

16
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:09,450
a low frequency, and that's the definition of aliasing, or

17
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,530
I should say that's an example of aliasing, the definition is it's the signal

18
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,490
that travels sort of in disguise of another signal or of other frequencies.

19
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,020
All right.

20
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,650
Now we're going to make this formal in just a minute, but that's what's going on

21
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,660
in aliasing is that I've got a signal and I can't distinguish between a low

22
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,540
frequency that was in there and actually a high frequency
