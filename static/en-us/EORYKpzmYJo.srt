1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,600
Let's take a closer look at the methods
we'll use in the My Favorite Movies app.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,050
Here's the documentation for
the movie database.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,600
I've posted a link to this
documentation in the instructor notes.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,250
Scroll down a little
bit here on the left.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,505
This section on the right gives us
a list of all the methods provided

6
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:17,105
by the API.

7
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:25,595
I'm going to select Account, and then
go to Account/ID/Favorite right here.

8
00:00:25,595 --> 00:00:28,209
This is a method that we'll be
using in My Favorite Movies.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,750
As you might expect,
this method can be used to add or

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,930
remove movies from
an account's favorite list.

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,810
You can see we have this information
about the required parameters,

12
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,360
as well as this required
JSON body section.

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,880
The JSON body,
also known as the HTTP body.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,350
Is part of an HTTP request that
allows us to pass parameters,

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,340
without having to pass them in the URL,
like we've done before.

16
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,000
We'll start using the JSON Body
when we make our first

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,070
post request later in this lesson.

18
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,980
For now I want you to focus on
an extremely useful feature of the movie

19
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,780
database's documentation.

20
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,470
If we click this post banner here,
a pane will slide out from the right.

21
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,310
And in this pane,
we can take a look at example request.

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,190
This is very much like the API
explorer that we saw with Flickr, so

23
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,170
let's scroll down a little bit.

24
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,380
And it gives us this really
nice boilerplate code,

25
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,740
that we can use to call each
of the methods in the API.

26
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,590
So for this particular example,
we're calling HTTP,

27
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,900
here's the url, for count id favorite.

28
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,130
Notice it has id in red, because you'd
have to substitute in an id value for

29
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,140
the user id.

30
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,350
But if we keep going down,
we can see in a share all session,

31
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,290
these are some classes that we're
familiar with, and this is really nice.

32
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,980
If we continue to scroll to the bottom,
we can see an example response.

33
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,480
And for this particular method,
the response returns a status code and

34
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,990
a stats message, and

35
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,650
if it's successful, it says, the item
slash record was updated successfully.

36
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,550
Before you get started,
I highly recommend just taking

37
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,740
some time with the documentation, and
clicking some of the other methods and

38
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,260
taking a look at their
example responses.

39
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,030
And their example boilerplate code here,
to actually make the network request.

40
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,729
If we look back at the required
parameters section,

41
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,430
we see this parameter called session_id.

42
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,060
What's this parameter all about?

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,390
Well, if you do some digging,
you'll find that The Movie Database uses

44
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,020
sessions whenever we want to
write data using the API.

45
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,580
And by write, I'm referring
to the methods that update or

46
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,630
change data that's stored
in the movie database.

47
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,420
So this would include methods like,
account ID favorite,

48
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,550
where we're changing
an account's favorite list.

49
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,690
It might also include methods for
rating a movie.

50
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,950
There's some separate
documentation about sessions,

51
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,650
that's located on the movie database's
main website that I'm looking at now.

52
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,690
I'll post a link for
this in the instructor notes as well.

53
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,382
This page details how to create and
use a session,

54
00:02:50,382 --> 00:02:52,739
and it's associated session id.

55
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:58,109
Without reading the entire page,

56
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:02,080
we see that the basic work flow requires
us to create a new request token.

57
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,520
And then we can either do Step 2a or
Step 2b.

58
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,050
Step 2a says,
ask the user permission via the website.

59
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,190
Or we can the user permission via
the API, and then in Step three we

60
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,210
create that session ID that we
just saw in the documentation.

61
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:17,900
Now, you'll for

62
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,370
Step two, we do have these two different
ways of asking the user for permission.

63
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,760
One uses the website.

64
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,690
And one uses the API.

65
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,270
In this lesson, we're going to use Step
2b, and we're going to ask the user for

66
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,350
permission via the API.

67
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,670
And then in the next lesson
we're going to ask the user for

68
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,890
permission via the website.

69
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,100
So you'll get to look
at both approaches.

70
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,400
Now if you haven't already,

71
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,090
I highly encourage you to go through
this page and read it yourself.

72
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,510
And some of the terms might
not make sense yet, but

73
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,120
start building a mental picture of
the steps required to create a session.

74
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,450
because a session's what we're going to
need to make our first post request, and

75
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,020
actually favorite movies right?

76
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,240
The My Favorite Movies App.

77
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,390
So we'll need to be able to do that.

78
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,020
Before we go on,
let's talk to Travis and

79
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,670
see what he has to say about
authentication and the movie database.
