00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Alright, let's go through his together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Checking whether or not the tags match is as simple as checking to see if

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
the entry tag name matches the exit tag name

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
or the beginning tag name matches the closed tag name.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If they're not the same, then we'll indicate as much by calling graphics.warning.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Otherwise, they are the same, so I just tell our graphics library that we're beginning this tag.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's a bold tag. There may be some arguments. In this case, there aren't.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I call interpret on all the subtrees.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's convenient that we made interpret work on trees instead of single elements

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
because now it's just 1 line to call it here.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
When I'm done, and this is critical, we have to call graphics.endtag.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Otherwise, it would be run away bold.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The whole rest of the webpage would be bold.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We need to stop doing whatever this tag did.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We only want to apply it over the span that it controls.
