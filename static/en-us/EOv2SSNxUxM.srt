1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,780
We'll start things off here in lesson
one where you'll brain storm ideas for

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,650
your app, and
you'll also build a skeleton UI, and

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,530
kind of start looking at some APIs and
libraries.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,540
Now, if you are in the iOS
developer nano degree and

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,530
you were following along with
the intersperse lessons,

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,490
you can skip this lesson and
move on to lesson two.

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,680
Because in lesson two, is where were
going to start choosing an idea for

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,710
our app, thinking through features,
building through a paper prototype, and

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,460
then actually building and
testing our app.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,370
We'll do lots of user testing in
this phase, to help us find bugs and

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,030
also make sure that people
want to actually use your app.

12
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,590
Then, in lesson three,
you'll reflect on the process.

13
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,465
And you'll think about those things
that maybe you'd do differently, or

14
00:00:44,465 --> 00:00:45,295
you could do better.

15
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,159
Because as developers,
if we're going to get better,

16
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,922
we have to think about those things
that we're kind of not so great at.

17
00:00:51,922 --> 00:00:56,001
Now, also this course is only
going to teach you to build an app.

18
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:59,817
We're not going to talk about
monetizing it or building a business.

19
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:01,450
If you're interested in that,

20
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,700
Udasity has an entrepreneurship
management nanodegree.

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,030
Which is a great option,
if you're a budding entrepreneur and

22
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,420
you want to make a business
out of an iPhone app.

23
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,870
There's a link to it in the instructor
notes, if you want to go check that out.

24
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,530
Now as we continue, this is going
to be a wonderfully messy and

25
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,960
creative and awesome, but
sometimes frustrating journey.

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,860
And, it's often said that the journey
of a hundred miles begins with

27
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,090
a single step.

28
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,546
So, let's take that step now.
