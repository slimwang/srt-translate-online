1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,560
So here's a typical group of friends in middle

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,450
school. And some of the people are popular, some of

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,050
them might not be. The first step to deciding

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,290
who's popular, is looking at who has a lot of

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,070
friends. So let's draw in some links, that show

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,290
who's a friend. And friendship links are one directional. Just

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,020
because Alice's friends with Bob, doesn't mean that Bob

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,910
is friend with Alice. So we'll draw our links as

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,040
arrows, so this means this person, we'll call him Bob, is

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,560
friends with Alice. And let's say, Alice

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,320
has many friends. And let's say Bob is also friends with

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,680
this person, they're friends with each other.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,270
We have lots of friendship links. Some

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,600
of them are bi-directional but not all of them. So, we have lots of friendships.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,680
So, is this enough to decide who's popular. So, if you

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,620
went to a school like I did, it's not. Just having a

17
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,730
lot of friends is not enough to make you popular, you

18
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,860
have to have the right friends. You have to be friends with

19
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,510
the popular people. So, it's not enough to have lots of

20
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,710
geeky friends say in high school, you've gotta have lots of friends

21
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,580
that are popular. So that means the definition of popular, isn't

22
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,690
just about having lots of friends, it's about having lots of friends,

23
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,970
who also have lots of friends. That's what

24
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,800
make some one popular, so we can define

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,600
popularity of a person is the number of

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,470
people who are friends with p. This means

27
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,100
the number of links from someone else to

28
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,288
that person is their popularity score. So here

29
00:01:34,288 --> 00:01:37,456
is Charlie, so there are one, two, three

30
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:41,856
links into Charlie, so Charlie's popularity score would

31
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:45,030
be three. Alice also has three links, so her

32
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,270
popularity score would also be three. Bob only has one

33
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,435
arrow going to Bob, so his popularity score would be

34
00:01:50,435 --> 00:01:53,730
one. So, this isn't a bad way to define popularity,

35
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,480
but it's not quite right. So, the definition of popularity

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,270
doesn't just depend on the number of friends you have,

37
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,000
it depends on, both, the number, and the popularity of

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,920
your friends. So, we can change the definition. Let's instead

39
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,199
define the popularity score of a person p. Now

40
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,010
it's going to be the sum of the popularities of

41
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,890
all of their friends. So we can write that in

42
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,590
a mathematical way, so using the sigma means to sum

43
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,830
up. We're going to take each friend, that is in

44
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,918
the friends of p. And we're going to sum up the

45
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:28,890
popularity score of the friends. If the mathematical notation is

46
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,320
unfamiliar to you, we could also write this as pseudo

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,520
Python code. We're thinking of the popularity of

48
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,400
a person p. Let's assume we have a

49
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,760
function that gives us the friends. So we're

50
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,050
going to start with a score of zero. We're going to

51
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,140
loop through the friends. And for each friend,

52
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,960
we're going to add to p score, the popularity score

53
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,370
of the friend. And we'll return the score

54
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,580
as the result. So now, you've seen a mathematical

55
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,620
definition of popularity, you've seen the same thing as code. I'm going to ask

56
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,520
you a very important quiz question next. Its an easy one to get

57
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,620
right if you try it twice because there's only two answers, but think

58
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,570
about it carefully. See if you can get it right the first time.
