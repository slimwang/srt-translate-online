00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,719
The drinking bird has just one degree of freedom. It can rotate around its

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,822
pivot point. However, the motion along this axis is fairly complex, and is

3
00:00:06,822 --> 00:00:10,598
difficult to capture in a few simple equations. One brute force method to

4
00:00:10,598 --> 00:00:13,864
create animations is called motion capture. The idea is to capture the

5
00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:17,510
movements of a person or object by using a few strategically placed cameras.

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,565
The information recorded is processed to derive the paths of various parts of

7
00:00:20,565 --> 00:00:25,190
the body. These motions are then applied to the model in the virtual world. To

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,750
more easily track where each part of the body goes, it's common to attach ping

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,899
pong balls or lights to a person while filming them. These attached objects are

10
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,230
called markers. There's a a move toward marker less systems where no special

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,805
suits are needed. In the foreground here, you can see the actors pose being

12
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:42,951
capture and applied to a character. In this clip there's a lot going on. You

13
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:45,842
might want to watch it a few times. In the upper right the 2 actresses are

14
00:00:45,842 --> 00:00:50,390
being recorded. The cameraman is also moving around the scene. In the lower

15
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,860
right you can see a reconstruction of the actresses's motions. On the left,

16
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,094
these motions are being applied to the 2 computer animation characters in real

17
00:00:57,094 --> 00:01:01,178
time. There're 2 views here on the left. On the one half is the cameraman's

18
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:05,358
view. The other half shows a fixed camera view of the whole scene. Motion

19
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:08,094
capture is used extensively in the film and games industry, as it's a

20
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:12,600
straightforward way to quickly generate animations and is cost-effective. There

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,235
are some drawbacks. The first is cost of entry. This process is currently not

22
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:19,964
something you can easily do without some investment. That said, costs are

23
00:01:19,964 --> 00:01:22,694
coming down, and inexpensive hardware such as Microsoft's Kinect can be used

24
00:01:22,694 --> 00:01:27,509
for capture. You can also use more limited forms of capture. This demo, by

Jerome

[UNKNOWN],

27
00:01:28,293 --> 00:01:31,984
does head tracking using a web cam. It's using 3JS and is Free Source, so it's

28
00:01:31,984 --> 00:01:37,160
something you can instantly use yourself. Motion capture can only do so much.

29
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,628
Systems that use markers can track only those markers. For example, hand and

30
00:01:40,628 --> 00:01:44,968
finger gestures will not be caught by a full body capture system. Motion

31
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:48,840
tracking is also affected by the limitations of the actors in the world itself.

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,464
There are real world constraints on real world performances, and the data is

33
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:55,070
only as good as your actors can provide. Artists generating animation have

34
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,670
unlimited freedom, at least until they run out of time or money. To get back to

35
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,550
our humble drinking bird, the way this process could work is that we track the

36
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,382
motion over time. The positions tracked could be turned into the amount of

37
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:08,947
rotation of the Z-axis for the bird's moving part. We would then have a giant

38
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:12,450
table of values, which we could interpolate between. At some given time T, the

39
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,542
angle of rotation is Z. Apply this rotation at that time, and we have an

40
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:18,469
animation matching real life.
