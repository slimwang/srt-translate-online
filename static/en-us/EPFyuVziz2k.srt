00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,757
Now, I think this is a really difficult concept, so fair warning, this might be

2
00:00:04,757 --> 00:00:08,979
confusing. If you're totally good on this, awesome, move forward. If not, you

3
00:00:08,979 --> 00:00:12,517
might want to spend a little bit of extra time trying to understand this

4
00:00:12,517 --> 00:00:16,350
concept. Since we said that we can substitute really whatever we want in the

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,370
place of x, I can actually substitute in a different expression that involves an

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,605
x. So here we have a function defined with x as the independent variable. And in

7
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:30,100
the place of a independent variable I can plug in x squared for example.

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,935
Remember that these variables are really just place holders for us to plug in,

9
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:38,190
other numbers that we know that they can equal. And if we decide that we want to

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,364
plug in x squared, we are totally entitled to do that. So, how would you write

11
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:48,662
out, in simplest terms, what f of x squared is? And yes, please remember to

12
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:50,383
simplify as much as you can.
