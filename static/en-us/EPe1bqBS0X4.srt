1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,305
The general GI section only has four
properties that we can play with.

2
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:08,370
Indirect intensity and bounce boost
are pretty self explanatory in

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,150
that they control how intense indirect
light stored in the light map and

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,670
how much light should bounce
in the scene respectively.

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,880
Then, there's the default
parameter that lets us control

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,300
a lot more specific properties
in the baking process.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,840
Check out the Unity documentation for
how you can control these properties.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,820
And lastly, there's the directional
mode, which is a drop-down of three

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:34,535
choices, non directional, directional,
and directional specular.

10
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:39,630
From the materials lesson, remember
the terms diffuse, normal, and specular?

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,920
These modes are all ways to capture
light information when baking

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,330
that brings out the best
in our materials.

13
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,930
Nondirectional mode
stores light information

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,640
as if materials were purely diffuse.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,680
Directional mode stores the same
information as non-directional mode, and

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,290
also stores the direction
light hits objects

17
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,480
to make the most out of normal maps.

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,515
And as you can probably guess,
directional specular stores directional

19
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:07,289
mode information as well as indirect
lighting information to use for

20
00:01:07,289 --> 00:01:09,387
the specular property on materials.

21
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:12,706
Given this information and the fact
that we're targeting Google Cardboard,

22
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,430
what do you think is the correct
directional mode we should use?
