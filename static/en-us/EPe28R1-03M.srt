00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,330
So each x that we see we want to substitute negative m directly into that spot.

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,984
Since we know that the entire quantity x is squared, we need to make sure that

3
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:13,650
the entire quantity negative m is squared. So I put parentheses around it to

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,328
indicate this. The same thing is true with subtracting here. You have minus

5
00:00:17,328 --> 00:00:22,289
negative m and then plus 2. So let's simplify this, negative m squared turns out

6
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,851
to be just m squared. Since the negative signs will multiply with one another

7
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:31,845
and turn in to a positive sign. Minus negative m is the same as plus m and then

8
00:00:31,845 --> 00:00:34,340
we have plus 2 at the end. Great!
