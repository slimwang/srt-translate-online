1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,850
The correct one is number two.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,670
Threads are inherently complex and
dangerous.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,270
If you try to write a concurrent
app by using threads directly,

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,560
it's very easy to create
hard to predict bugs, and

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,150
seriously hurt
the performance of your app.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,210
GCD makes it easier and
safer to write asynchronous programs,

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:24,110
by hiding the threads within
the concept of a queue of closure.

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,970
Blades, for example,
are inherently dangerous, so

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,510
we added handles to make for
safer knives.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,130
This is the same idea.

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,990
The queue is the handle for the thread.
