1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,290
So from the Trait Theory perspective people have consistent and unique

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,645
dispositions for behaving and there are five major dimensions of personality,

3
00:00:08,645 --> 00:00:13,130
openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and nervousness or

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,290
neuroticism and recall also that traits lower our threshold for behaving in

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,320
particular ways and that these traits exists on a continuum from low on one

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:29,801
side to high on the other. And therefore we can plot any person's personality

7
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:35,749
on a graph, just as we have here. So here are my scores after taking the big

8
00:00:35,749 --> 00:00:43,712
five personality test. So I was very high in openness to new experiences. I was

9
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:50,170
medium low on conscientiousness, a little bit closer to the disorganized side.

10
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:56,552
I was medium high on extroversion. I was high, quite high, on agreeableness and

11
00:00:56,552 --> 00:01:00,776
I was also quite low on nervousness or another way of saying that would be high

12
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:06,181
on calmness and relaxation. And the nice thing about this personality

13
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:11,006
questionnaire is you can compare other people too. So Lauren, for instance,

14
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:16,753
took the same test. And here were her scores. We were very similar on openness

15
00:01:16,753 --> 00:01:21,870
to experience. She was higher on conscientiousness, very high on extroversion,

16
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:27,938
you might have gotten a sense that she's very extroverted. She's also a very

17
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:32,299
agreeable, medium high at least. And we're very similar on calmness, neither

18
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:35,230
one of us gets too nervous and high strung.
