1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,740
So given that just using a higher resolution

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,470
image, everywhere, isn't a great solution, what do

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,610
you think you should do? Should you use

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,950
a low quality source image? Replace it with

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,460
JavaScript? Should you expect the server to give

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,840
you the proper pixel density image magically? Or,

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,670
should you make several copies of the image

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,130
and conditionally request the right one from the client?
