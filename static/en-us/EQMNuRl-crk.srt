00:00:04,132 --> 00:00:07,696
even by today's standards, what Milgrim did, in his research, was actually not

3
00:00:07,696 --> 00:00:13,615
unethical in terms of the deception. Because he did two things. He debriefed

4
00:00:13,615 --> 00:00:19,215
his participants. And it was a necessary part of the design. In fact if you

5
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:22,845
think about it, research often needs to use some degree of deception because if

6
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:26,035
we told participants in advance what the study was about, and what our

7
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:31,080
hypotheses were, it would completely invalidate the results.
