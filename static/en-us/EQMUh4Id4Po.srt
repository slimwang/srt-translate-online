1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,030
All right, why don't we walk through the solution.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,920
Here, we're going to start with our olympic_medal_counts_df DataFrame,

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,150
as we have in the previous exercises.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,160
First, we're going to create a new, smaller dataframe called metal counts,

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,480
which is the olympic_medal_count_df DataFrame, but only the gold, silver, and

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,125
bronze columns.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,175
Then we're going to use the numpy.dot function to matrix multiply this

8
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:26,810
metal_counts_matrix with the 4, 2, 1 array which represents the number of

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,460
points that each country would score for a gold, silver, or bronze medal.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,280
So what we're going to get here is an array,

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,190
where the value is 4 times the number of gold medals plus 2 times the number of

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,020
silver medals plus 1 times the number of bronze medals.

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,750
Down here, I'm going to define this Python dictionary called olympic_points,

14
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,430
where again I provide us the keys,

15
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,490
the column names, and as the values pandas series, where I provide as

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,370
the argument first the list of country names and here, this array points,

17
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,040
which again has the total number of points that each country earned.

18
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:05,830
Finally, I'm just going to say olympic_points_df is DataFrame of olympic_points.

19
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,600
This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to pandas and

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,610
numpy's functionality.

21
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,830
If you're interested to read more about what these libraries can do,

22
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,950
I encourage you to check out the full documentation which are found in
