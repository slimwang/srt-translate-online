00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,945
Now it's important to know that there are cultural restraints when it comes to

2
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:09,810
IQ testing. The question of race and IQ is very complicated and controversial.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,173
Now we won't cover all the nuances of this argument, and the evidence

4
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:17,682
supporting it. But it's true that traditional IQ tests have worked against

5
00:00:17,682 --> 00:00:22,950
people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, because they're so verbally based.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,793
And people from low socioeconomic backgrounds tend to be exposed to less

7
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:32,064
complex vocabulary. In order to be more culturally fair, non verbal

8
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:36,782
intelligence tests have been created. The most well known of these is Raven's

9
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:41,238
Progressive Matrix Test. This is what the test looks like. Because this simply

10
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:44,694
asks the person to recognize a pattern in shapes, it doesn't require special

11
00:00:44,694 --> 00:00:49,740
language or educational skills. Hence, it's culturally free.
