00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,262
The first two graphs here, which are the ones with even degree, are these two

2
00:00:03,262 --> 00:00:07,413
graphs down here. The one with the positive leading coefficient is graph D, the

3
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:11,465
one whose ends are both pointing upward. It's coming from up high on the left

4
00:00:11,465 --> 00:00:14,850
and rising up again on the right. B is the graph that has an even degree, but a

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,608
negative leading coefficient. It's coming up from negative infinity on the left

6
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:22,500
side and dropping back down there again on the right. The top two graphs both

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,902
have odd degree. Graph A has a negative leading coefficient, since it's

8
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:30,385
starting way up high and then dropping down low on the right. And graph C has a

9
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:34,829
positive leading coefficient, since it's starting low and then rising high.
