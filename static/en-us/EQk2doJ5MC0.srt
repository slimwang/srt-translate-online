1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,560
All right, awesome,
I get to tell you about coco values.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,070
So coco stands for
cooperative-competitive values.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,110
>> Coco stands for that?

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,320
>> Well, the coco part of coco value
stands for cooperative-competitive.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:10,868
>> Okay.

6
00:00:10,868 --> 00:00:13,031
>> And this is an idea due to Kalai and

7
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:16,430
Kalai because you need as
many of those as you can get.

8
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,220
>> Mm-hm.

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,760
>> Here is an example
of coco values that

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,220
feature some people
that you may recognize.

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,650
So this is Curly and
Smooth and the bananas.

12
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,500
So Curly and
Smooth would like to get bananas,

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,850
turns out Curly is too
short to get any bananas.

14
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,580
>> So true.

15
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,010
>> And Smooth is tall
enough to get two bananas.

16
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,718
>> Yeah, it's very.

17
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:39,550
>> But if Smooth stood on top of Curly's
head, then he could actually get four

18
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,130
bananas, he could reach these
two additional high bananas.

19
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,120
>> So it's like a Tuesday.

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,200
>> So
let's set this up as a matrix game.

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,510
Here's a matrix version of the game.

22
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,470
So this is suggest to you and
you have two choices.

23
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,454
You can just reach for
the bananas yourself, or

24
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:55,325
you could stand on the top of my
head and reach the other bananas.

25
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:56,520
>> So you're my friend in this.

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,160
>> Sorry, Curly,
you can stand on the top of Curly.

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,985
Not you, I mean Smooth can
stand on top of Curly's head.

28
00:01:00,985 --> 00:01:02,324
>> Okay.

29
00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:07,409
>> And Curly has the choice of either
[LAUGH] allowing that to happen or

30
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:08,680
not, okay.

31
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,750
>> I like this game.

32
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,630
>> Yeah.

33
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,959
Believe it or not, I did not make this
up for the purposes of this class.

34
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:17,020
And so
we can ask some questions about this.

35
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,486
So for example, what's the nash?

36
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:21,070
>> I'm sorry, you're actually
asking me [LAUGH] what the nash is?

37
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,030
I guess I should-
>> It's a rhetorical question,

38
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,320
except it's not rhetorical.

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,860
It's just a question.

40
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,480
>> Pure nash?

41
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,810
>> If you can find one, sure.

42
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,080
>> Okay, well, is there a pure nash?

43
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,470
I mean, I've just seen these numbers for
the first time.

44
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,660
>> Yeah, but you shouldn't.

45
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,670
Okay, sure.

46
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,250
>> So I can just ask the question,
all right so, if we do don't boost and

47
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,640
reach, would either want to move?

48
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,490
Well, it doesn't really matter
if you go from reach to climb.

49
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,550
You get the same value.

50
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,080
>> Right.
>> And

51
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,410
it doesn't matter if-
>> No, wait.

52
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,494
No, you, sorry, you, right, you, Smooth.

53
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:54,484
It doesn't matter to Smooth-
>> It doesn't matter to Smooth once if

54
00:01:54,484 --> 00:01:58,437
you're in don't boost, reach, and
if you're in don't boost, reach,

55
00:01:58,437 --> 00:02:00,220
it also doesn't, wait.

56
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,260
No, I'm sorry, I take that back.

57
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,940
>> It does matter.

58
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,810
>> It does matter,
I'm reading the numbers backwards.

59
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,020
So, the first one is for Curly, and
the second number's for Smooth.

60
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,500
>> See, I put them in the same order
as there, where they're standing.

61
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,509
>> That makes perfect sense.

62
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:14,670
So if you have 0,2, so then if we're
stuck on don't boost and Smooth can move

63
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,860
from reach to climb, Smooth would not do
that because you're going from 2 to 0.

64
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,725
Meanwhile, if we're in don't boost,
reach, and Curly can change,

65
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,700
then Curly would go from 0 to 0.

66
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,310
And it doesn't really make a difference.

67
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,500
I guess don't boost and
reach is a Nash equilibrium.

68
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,841
So, let's see, I think there's probably
there's a symmetry thing there.

69
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:38,122
So we know don't boost and
climb is not a Nash equilibrium.

70
00:02:38,122 --> 00:02:40,995
For the same reason that 0,
2 is one, 0, 0 is not,

71
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,910
because I'd be going from
0 to 2 if I were Smooth.

72
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,976
So there's no point in
worrying about that.

73
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:46,460
What about boost and reach?

74
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,398
Well, let's see.

75
00:02:47,398 --> 00:02:51,370
That's 0, 2, and so
Curly doesn't need to move,

76
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,370
doesn't have an advantage to
moving from boost to don't boost.

77
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,720
But Smooth would want to move because
you'd be going from 2 to 4, so

78
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,732
that is not Nash equilibrium.

79
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:01,490
>> Okay.
>> Now let's look at boost and climb, so

80
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,060
boost and climb, let's see, it's 0, 4.

81
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,800
So if I went from boost to don't boost,
I would still stay at 0, and

82
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,430
so that doesn't help Curly any.

83
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,500
And I wouldn't move from climb to reach
because I'd be going from 4 to 2, and

84
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,110
so therefore, that is also a Nash.

85
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,970
>> All right, now,

86
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,230
which Nash equilibrium do you
think would be more beneficial?

87
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,040
>> Well for Smooth,
it would definitely be boost and climb.

88
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,670
>> Yeah.
What about for like the society of these

89
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,710
two people, like if you just add
up the total retrieved bananas?

90
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,100
>> So that would be 2 versus 4.

91
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,290
>> Yeah.
>> So in fact again, boost and

92
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,240
climb would be,
on average, more benefit.

93
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,360
>> On average.

94
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,490
>> Or the sum for the society.

95
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,170
>> Yeah, right.
>> So on average is all the same thing.

96
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,760
>> Right, but it sort of doesn't matter
to Curly, but it would matter to Smooth,

97
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,550
and it's also the case that to Nash,
it doesn't really matter.

98
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,850
Both of these are Nash equilibrium, so

99
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,248
they're both perfectly acceptable from a
Nash equilibrium sort of point of view.

100
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:57,670
>> Yeah, this is like the example
that I did with chicken,

101
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,476
where you have two Nash equilibrium, and

102
00:03:59,476 --> 00:04:02,228
they're both kind of equally
good from Nash's point of view.

103
00:04:02,228 --> 00:04:03,428
Although in that case,

104
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:07,290
they're very different from
the two players' point of view.

105
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,600
Here, I suppose either way,
Curly gets nothing.

106
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,570
So really,
it's just about making Smooth happy.

107
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,669
I like this game.

108
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:17,420
>> [LAUGH] So okay, sure, fine.

109
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,180
So that being said, can we see
anything about correlated equilibria?

110
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,269
>> I mean, I'm sure we can, right?

111
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,647
We can, any makes Nash equilibrium
is a correlated equilibrium, but

112
00:04:24,647 --> 00:04:27,520
I think this one's a little
different right here, right?

113
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,820
Because no matter what happens,
Curly gets 0.

114
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,800
>> So that means that anything's
going to be equally okay to Curly.

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,660
>> Right.
>> So Curly is not really

116
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,020
going to participate in
the equilibriumness or lack thereof.

117
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,020
>> Right, so really, this is all about
getting to boosting and climbing.

118
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,889
>> Yeah, though I think you said that
any convex combination of a Nash

119
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:48,710
is a correlated equilibrium.

120
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,251
>> That's right.
>> So it should be everything like 0, 2,

121
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:59,410
0 to 1, 0 to 2, 0 to 3, 0 to 4, 0 to 5,
0 to 6, all the way up to 0, 3, 0,4.

122
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,342
We know that all those have to be Nash,
correlated, they have to be a value of

123
00:05:04,342 --> 00:05:08,600
some correlated equilibrium
that is like 0, 3, for example.
