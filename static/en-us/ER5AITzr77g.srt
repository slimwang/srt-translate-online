1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,130
So here are our population parameters. Let's say that I want to bring up this

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,040
ratio. So I want more people to watch more of the lessons, so I'm going to spice

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,936
things up. Well in lesson nine you're going to learn how to formally determine

4
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:18,059
whether or not something had an effect. This is called hypothesis testing. And

5
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,399
I'm thinking about writing a song on how hypothesis testing works and then

6
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:27,411
singing it for you in the next lesson. Like, for example, do you remember

7
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:34,430
learning the quadratic formula? X equals negative b plus or minus the square

8
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:42,180
root of b squared minus 4ac. All over 2a and those are the roots of a quadratic

9
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,278
function. Some people learned it in middle school as a song and maybe that made

10
00:00:47,278 --> 00:00:51,408
learning it a lot more fun. So I'm thinking about writing a song on hypothesis

11
00:00:51,408 --> 00:00:55,815
testing. And by the way, this is no joke, I'm seriously considering this.

12
00:00:55,816 --> 00:01:00,307
However, I don't want to run the risk of a song hurting rather than helping your

13
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:05,319
engagement with the course material. So, maybe I'll create the next lesson with

14
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:10,216
the song, but only make it available to a random sample of 20 students. And I

15
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:14,312
won't force them to watch it, I'll just do the same thing I always do, just make

16
00:01:14,312 --> 00:01:18,702
it available every week, just like I make the other lessons available. Then I'll

17
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:24,615
look at this ratio. Let's pretend that for this sample we get that the mean

18
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:25,794
ratio is 0.13.
