00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,091
Remember that we're trying to get x by itself. So the next step we need to take

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:08,055
in order to do that is to get rid of this factor of 3 out in front here, so that

3
00:00:08,055 --> 00:00:12,268
I can rewrite the equation with a factor of 3 gone from this side. Of course we

4
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:16,236
need to do this legally, so think about what that means for the right side of

5
00:00:16,236 --> 00:00:17,461
the equation as well.
