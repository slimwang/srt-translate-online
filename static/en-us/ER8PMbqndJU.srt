1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, well that's pretty straight forward.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,220
A sum, well a sums are sums are sums.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,220
You know that's linear it's going to do the right thing.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,210
A max of course doesn't change, right?

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,810
If I've got two functions and I'm taking the max it's determined by, sort of,

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,100
the single biggest value and the rest of the function doesn't matter.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,120
And of course square root,

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,310
well that's not going to be linear because square roots are never linear.

9
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,270
I think you can figure that out.
