00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,392
It is being a while since we were with Athena. So let us get back to talking

2
00:00:03,392 --> 00:00:08,952
about her life. Now Athena lives in California, in the Bay area to be exact. To

3
00:00:08,952 --> 00:00:11,706
tell a more about you, here is the Pacific Ocean and here is West of

4
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:16,149
California. Here is San Francisco Bay. It is a pretty beautiful area to live

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,979
in. And she goes to school in Saint Jose Bay right down here. And all of these

6
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:24,761
little cities lie right along the bay now, sometimes Athena likes to take a

7
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:28,543
non-stop train from San Jose, all the way up to San Francisco, which is this

8
00:00:28,543 --> 00:00:34,533
northern city right here. Along the train line, which I have drawn in red right

9
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:39,466
here, are a bunch of other stations. Including Sunnyvale, Mount View, Palo

10
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:45,378
Alto, Redwood City, San Mateo and Millbrae. So, let me ask you a question. If

11
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,834
Athena wants to take that nonstop train starting in San Jose and going all the

12
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:52,290
way up to San Francisco, which stations must the train pass through along the

13
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:58,154
way? Remember the red path here is the train track. It doesn't branch off

14
00:00:58,154 --> 00:01:01,163
anywhere. it just follows this path exactly.
