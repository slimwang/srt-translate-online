00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,580
Now that we know how to load images into the canvas,

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,680
let's start thinking about how we're actually going to start drawing on that.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,810
To do so, I've gone ahead and changed out the code over here.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,080
And instead of the image, I've switched in the methods fill rectangle and

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,770
stroke rectangle.

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,370
I've also made the canvas a little bit bigger if you're following along.

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,420
Fill rectangle and stroke rectangle work fairly, similarly.

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,730
Got their starting x and

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,400
y coordinates and then their widths and heights all patched in a parameters.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,267
So let's go ahead and see what these two look like.

11
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:34,990
I will come over here and open up this document.

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,340
Cmd+O > Stroke Canvas > Open.

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,730
And we see that this code creates two different rectangles.

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,437
The filled rectangle starts at 100, 100 and has a width of 100, 100 and

15
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:49,035
that's this big black rectangle right here.

16
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:54,294
And the stroke rectangle starts at 50, 50 and is 50 by 50 pixels wide.

17
00:00:54,294 --> 00:00:57,243
And that's this gray rectangle right here.

18
00:00:57,243 --> 00:00:58,950
Or I guess you could call them squares,

19
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,880
because they have the same widths and heights.

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,269
But either way, this demo is to show that filled rectangles are filled in

21
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,080
with colors while stroke rectangles are not.
