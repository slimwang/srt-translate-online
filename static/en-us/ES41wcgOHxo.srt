00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,690
According to this report
that I'm talking about, and

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,290
this is fairly recent, the answer is no.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,420
In fact,
they report a slight dip in 2014.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,120
So people are not investing.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,200
Either they don't have the money to
invest, they don't think they're getting

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,260
a good return on it, maybe they don't
understand the risk very precisely.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,210
If it's vague then of course it's
hard to convince someone to put out

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,630
the dollars to do that.

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,060
So now cyber security budgets or

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,980
investments in cyber security
are not dramatically going up.
