00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,855
>> So the two numbers that we're going to need to help us with factoring add to

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:08,076
equal this middle coefficient but multiply to equal the product of the two outer

3
00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:12,213
coefficients. Now I wonder if this works if we don't have an expression just

4
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:16,419
like this, where the coefficient out here is 1, in front of the x squared term.

5
00:00:16,419 --> 00:00:21,110
Let's say we have something different. Maybe we have 8x squared plus 26x plus

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:26,046
15. Of course, the important thing here is that 8 is not 1. So our coefficient

7
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:30,986
in front of the x squared term is different this time than what we've dealt with

8
00:00:30,986 --> 00:00:35,923
before. The question I have for you then is, what are the numbers n and m for

9
00:00:35,923 --> 00:00:41,861
this expression right here? What two numbers add to equal 26 and multiply to

10
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:43,325
equal 8 times 15?
