00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,250
In addition to signature based
approaches, a misused detection system

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,193
can also use a more sophisticated
Rule-Based Approach.

3
00:00:08,193 --> 00:00:14,070
A Rule-Based Approach uses rules
to represent known intrusions.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,920
These rules,
typically match multiple signatures or

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,490
patterns in the activity data.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,720
These rules are not only
specific to the known intrusions,

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,190
they can also be specific to
the target of protected network.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,547
Because the same intrusion may leave
different evidence in a different

9
00:00:33,547 --> 00:00:36,900
network depending on
the network set ups.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,850
SNORT is a widely known example

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,610
of a Rule-Based Network
Intrusion Detection System.
