00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,110
Now that we have a better
understanding for

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,540
how things can be grouped together
to communicate relationships,

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,730
let's talk about the specifics of
laying things out on the screen.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,590
Material design uses an 8dp
grid to align components.

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,080
Text aligns to a 4dp baseline grid.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,140
Let's take a closer look at the grid so
you can see it a bit clearer.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,490
Notice that for finer grid control,
the baselines of text sit on a 4dp grid.

8
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,892
That's kind of a subset
of this 8dp grid.

9
00:00:30,892 --> 00:00:35,318
So things like image and
icon sizes, spacing,

10
00:00:35,318 --> 00:00:40,088
margins, and
paddings are all multiples of 8dp.

11
00:00:40,088 --> 00:00:45,020
So things like 16, 72, 40, and
16, those are multiples of 8.

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,556
And for text, line heights
are multiples of 4, so 20dp.

13
00:00:49,556 --> 00:00:54,820
These 8dp and 4dp grids allow us to
easily apply the laws of grouping and

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,460
keep our UIs organized, balanced, and

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,237
in harmony with the rest
of the operating system.

16
00:01:00,237 --> 00:01:04,200
There are material designed templates
and stencils that use this grid,

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,790
available for Adobe Illustrator,
Photoshop, and Sketch.

18
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,620
Check the instructor's notes for
links to them.

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,390
Even though there's a grid, we need a
couple other pieces to lay out our UIs.

20
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,830
Keylines are used to vertically or

21
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,195
horizontally align objects
in a user interface.

22
00:01:21,195 --> 00:01:24,895
Aesthetically, they enforce
a sense of order in a UI.

23
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:28,585
They also make it much quicker to scan
the screen and take in the information.

24
00:01:28,585 --> 00:01:33,405
The material design specs suggest some
common keylines to use in mobile design.

25
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:38,655
Using 16dp margins from the left and
right for auxiliary content like icons,

26
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:42,412
and avatars, and so on, and
72dp from the left edge for

27
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:48,030
the primary content, the things like
the page title and the page contents.

28
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,690
Now, if you don't have
auxiliary content,

29
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:54,150
then your primary content should
probably also align to the 16dp keyline.

30
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,940
And the exact value of these keyline is
less important than the concept aligning

31
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,720
content to bring order to your UI, and
making it quicker to visually parse.

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,980
Before we move further,

33
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,080
let me pass it over to James to have you
apply these concepts in Android Studio.
