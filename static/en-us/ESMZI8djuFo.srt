00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,880
So here we are in the Python documentation, and

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,870
if I scroll down, I can find a module

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,420
named turtle. There is a lot of helpful information

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,310
about the module here, including information on why turtle

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,690
is actually called turtle. And if I scroll down

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,660
on this page, I will find a class Turtle.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,040
Turtle with a capital T, which is the class

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,620
we used. There it is. I'm going to go back,

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,610
and if I scroll down again, I can see all of

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,360
the methods we use. Like forward, right, and a lot of others.
