00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here's a search tree for a version of Pacman in which there's only four squares.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There's a little Pacman guy who can move around,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and there are food dots that the Pacman can eat.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Maybe someplace else in the maze there are opponents,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but we're not going to worry about them right here.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We're just going to consider the Pacman's actions.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
He has two actions--to go left or right

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If he goes left, he goes over here and eats that food particle

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and then moves back right--that's his only move from that position.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Or if he moves right then he has two other moves.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now let's assume that we cut off the search at this depth,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and we want to have an evaluation function,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and the goal is for Pacman to eat all the food.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The evaluation function will be the number of food particles that he's eaten so far.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What I want you to do is tell me in these boxes

16
00:00:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
what the evaluation should be for each of these three states.
