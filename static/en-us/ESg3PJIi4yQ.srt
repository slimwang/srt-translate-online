1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,000
Back to where we were.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,816
Remember this equation, 0 is equal to X'.(T x RX)?

3
00:00:04,816 --> 00:00:07,320
We just rewrote that again.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,550
So, now I can get rid of that whole cross product thing, right, and put that

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,350
cool, little funky cross product notation in there, right, right, all right?

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,940
So, let me do a substitution.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,440
I'm going to let E.

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:25,680
Be just this, T cross R, okay, so it's just this substitution in here.

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:31,410
Well, as soon as you do that, you realize, I have this really beautiful elegant

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,920
expression that says X' prime transpose EX equals 0.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,590
And E is what's called the essential matrix.

12
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,500
And what's cool about the essential matrix is that, it relates the point X and

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,820
the same point, but it described in the other camera frame.

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,630
And note that these are world points.

15
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,500
In these frames for these calibrated systems.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,800
In a little bit we'll talk about the relationship between, world points and

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,410
the image points.

18
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,880
And it's a little bit closer than you might think,

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,050
because of the projective geometry.

20
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,760
In fact, one way of thinking about this really easily is

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,620
this is equal to 0, right?

22
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,850
So what if I multiplied X by some value A?

23
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,470
Would the equation still be true?

24
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,970
Of course it would.

25
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,610
So not only is it true for

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,480
the point out here, as expressed in this coordinate frame, it's true for

27
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,720
every point along that ray, expressed in that coordinate frame.

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,800
Likewise for every point along that ray.

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,220
Expressed in that coordinate frame, ooh.

30
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,270
That means, it also talks about image points, but we'll get there, all right?

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,020
One last thing, and this is going to, you're not going to totally get

32
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,440
that this time, but that's okay, you're going to get it next time, all right?

33
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,010
We said that this works for sort of, any point along that ray.

34
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,170
And, so you can think of that as the homogenous representation of all

35
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,140
the points along that array.

36
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,196
So this, so our E is our 3 by 3 here, times this 3 by 1, so

37
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:06,320
this is another vector here.

38
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,660
All right, we'll just call that L, okay.

39
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,300
Why am I calling it L?

40
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,180
What does L stand for?

41
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,230
Well in some weird language, we said it stood for

42
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,940
point, but in our language, it stands for line.

43
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,170
So remember that X transpose L, or P transpose L,

44
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:29,690
or L transpose P was the definition of a line in projective geometry.

45
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,770
So what this means is, if I knew where some point was in the image.

46
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,020
So I know what ray it's along in the image.

47
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,330
So I know where it is in the image.

48
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,400
I could put that point into this equation.

49
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,240
And I would have this L, which defines for me a line, in the other frame.

50
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,310
Just X prime transpose L equals 0,

51
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,230
that was the, the definition of a line in our projective geometry.

52
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,980
So in other words, if I gave you a point in one image of a calibrated set of

53
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:10,010
cameras, there's a line in the other image that that point must lie on.

54
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,440
What's that line called?

55
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,560
That's the epipolar line.

56
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,900
But notice, that everything on this side of the slide is algebra, right?

57
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,760
Forget all the geometry stuff.

58
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,680
So what we've done is we've now converted the epipolar constraint into

59
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,850
an algebraic expression.

60
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,870
Thank you very much.

61
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,690
No. That's what we're going to use, okay?

62
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,190
Great.
