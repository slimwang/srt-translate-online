1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,020
So, this is how we're going to be able to

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,470
measure the power of a hypothesis space. This is a really

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,010
clever definition. I did not come up with this and it

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,990
goes like this. For a given input and hypothesis space, we're

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,660
going to ask what is the largest set of inputs

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,910
that the hypothesis class can label in all possible ways? So,

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,920
in this example that we were looking at, it's actually really

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,030
simple because it turns out the answer is one. so, here,

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,790
here's an example. So being able to do this with one is not such a

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,320
big deal. If S is a set of points, a set of inputs, in this case

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,910
just six, it's one of the inputs from the set. Then are there hypotheses in the

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,000
hypothesis class that can label this in all

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,180
possible ways? Well, there's only two possible ways.

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,034
It can label it as true and it can label

15
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:51,310
it as false. So, here if we set theta to

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,310
I don't know, five, it'll label it as true. If

17
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,950
we have a different hypothesis that say sets theta to

18
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,800
eight, then we can label it as false. There is

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,160
a set of inputs of size one that we can

20
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,770
label in all possible ways. But is there any pair

21
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,560
of inputs that we can label in all four ways?

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,440
>> I'm going to say no.

23
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,070
>> And why is that?

24
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,842
>> Well because you're writing it, you're writing it

25
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:15,480
in sets but I sort of think of these as

26
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,430
points on a number line, and theta as a separating line.

27
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,090
And there's just kind of no way to label

28
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,580
anything to the left of the line as negative, ever.

29
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,740
Because you're requiring that x is greater than equal to

30
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,110
theta to be positive, so you can never label anything

31
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,140
to the left of that line as negative. So all

32
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,960
I have to do, right, is make x1 negative and

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,190
x2 positive, and there's nothing you can do. Is that right?

34
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,070
>> Indeed it is. So, in particular, pick

35
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,190
any two points x1, x2 on the line just

36
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,384
like you said, if as we roll theta, if we just kind of consider sets of theta

37
00:01:51,384 --> 00:01:55,890
as moving from left to right, it starts off where x1 and x2 are both going to

38
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,450
be labeled as true. Then as we move theta

39
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,150
to the right, x1 is going to eventually start

40
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,500
to be labeled false, so that okay, that's now two of

41
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,070
the combinations we've seen. We're going to keep moving theta to

42
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,560
the right, and now x2 is labeled as false. So we've

43
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,040
seen three of the combinations, but which combination didn't we see?

44
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,050
>> true, false.

45
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,020
>> And there's just no way to make that happen. Just like you said.

46
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,080
>> So would you say this is a weak hypothesis space?

47
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,460
>> It definitely seems to be pretty weak, even though

48
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,230
it's infinite. In fact, did it depend on x being finite?

49
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,170
>> No, actually, it

50
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,320
didn't. You're right.

51
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,770
>> Yeah, so all, so this really applies in the, in this very

52
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,640
general setting. We can take this definition, bring it to bear on an input

53
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,840
hypothesis pair like this, and it gives us a sense of how expressive

54
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,460
or how powerful the hypothesis space is. And in this case, not very expressive.
