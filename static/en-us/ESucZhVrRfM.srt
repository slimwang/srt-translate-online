00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,010
We use our F statistic to determine if we should accept or reject the null

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:09,006
hypothesis. Where in this case the null hypothesis would be that the amount

3
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:12,912
consumed by cows of food a, food b and c are all approximately the same which

4
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:19,848
we're assuming means that cows do not prefer one type of food over the another.

5
00:00:19,848 --> 00:00:23,628
And the alternative is that they at least prefer one type of food over the

6
00:00:23,628 --> 00:00:29,617
other. So we have to compare our F statistic with the critical value. Use the F

7
00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:33,216
table to find this critical value and then decide, do we accept the null

8
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:36,820
hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis.
