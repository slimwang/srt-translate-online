1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I wrote some code to read in the marvel data as a barpartate graph and then to build the character

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
by character graph and then find the top k strength

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and I just reuse the heap code from the last unit to do that.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The new part to focus on is right here. So it goes like this.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What we do is we look through all the different characters in the list of characters

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and for each character look at the different books for that character appears

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
then look at all the characters appearing in those books and for each of those triples, right.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So this is a character, the books for that character and the characters for that book

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
including the character itself by the way.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's going to make a link from the first character to the second character.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This make a link. I modified this made link so that if you make a link twice it just keep it count.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And so that's going to keep a measure of the total strength between character one and character two.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Really, if you think about what it's doing here.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's actually for each pair character one and character two, it's going to add one

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
each time there's a book they have in common.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Its count up the number of books in common between character one and character two,

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
which is really just what we wanted, but it's done in terms of a triple nested loop here.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The running time here has to do with the number of edges right.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not actually that the product of the nodes times the nodes times the nodes.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Though if it's a completely connected graph it will be, but if it's a sparse graph for each character,

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
we're only going to list the edges that come out of that.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
When I actually execute this, one other things we see is that this computer is faster than my laptop

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
by about a factor of 2, so it took me 0.5 to read the graph, but anyway, it reached the graph pretty quickly.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It computes all those strengths, which is the part that we're focusing on here

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
in just a couple of seconds and then it run through the characters

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
that are connected to other characters and finds the top 10 and I'm not a comic book expert,

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
but I know enough to actually recognize a couple of the things

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
that are going on here just the recent movies.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You can see that there a very strong connection between the human torch and the thing.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
These are both members of the fantastic four.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm going to say half of the members that fit fantastic four.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Here's another one, Mr. Fantastic, and I think the invisible woman is the other one.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What we see here is that books that have the human torch

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
will often also have the thing in them and so forth.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
All the different pairings of the fantastic four end up having very high weight.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They have a lot of books where they all appear together.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Similarly spiderman appears very often with, I'm pretty sure that's his grandmother,

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and also with his editor cause Peter Parker is a reporter,

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
so his editor J. Jonah Jameson shows up in a lot books with him.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Captain America shows up with Tony Stark and I don't think I would know that at all

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
except there's a current movie out that has them together

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and I think it's because they're both Avengers.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
They're individual characters but they also appear together often

44
00:02:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and I have no idea who Vision and Scarlet Witch are, but I'm sure they're awesome.
