00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Suppose we're playing a game--and that game is "guess the word"--

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
where I want you to guess a word,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and all I'm giving you is how many letters this word has.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So assuming you haven't already skipped ahead to the next part of this unit,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
can you guess my word?
