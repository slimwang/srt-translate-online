1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,009
Here's the Ensemble Learning algorithm. We're done,

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,610
Michael, we're done with the entire lesson.

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,800
We don't have to do anything else anymore. We know that we're supposed to

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,320
look over subset of data, pick up rules, and then combine them. So, what

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,120
else do you need to know in

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,400
order to write your first Ensemble Learning algorithm?

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,010
>> So, I'm already kind of uncomfortable with this notion of"

8
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,030
combine," right? So, like, I can think of lots of really dumb

9
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,700
ways to combine things. Like, choose one at random or, you

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,318
know, I don't know, add em all up and divide by pi

11
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:28,750
I mean so, so presumably there's gotta be

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,700
some intelligence in how this combination is taking place

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,970
>> Yes, you would think so, but your not

14
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,320
at all bothered about how you pick a subset?

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,800
>> Oh ,I was imaging you meant random subsets.

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,650
>> Oh ,so you'd automated assumption about how we were going to

17
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,252
pick a subset. You just [CROSSTALK] weren't sure how to combine them. Well

18
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,980
actually lets explore that for a minute. Here's kind of the dumbest

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,090
thing you can imagine doing. That turns out to work out pretty well.

20
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,620
We're going to pick subsets, by, I'm going to say uniformly. Just to

21
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,360
be specific about it. So ,we're going to do the dumbest thing

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,960
that we can think of, or one one of the dumbest

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,550
things you could think of. Or maybe ,we should say simplest and

24
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,180
not dumbest so as not to, to, to make a value

25
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,900
judgment. That you can think of doing which would be to just

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,640
uniformly randomly Choose among some of the data, and say that's

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,110
the data I'm going to look at, and then I'm going to apply some

28
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,020
learning algorithm to it. Is that what you were thinking of Micheal?

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,630
>> Yeah.

30
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,340
>> Okay, so just pick a subset of the

31
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,630
data, apply a learner to it. I'll get some

32
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,410
hypothesis out, I'll get some rule out. And now

33
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,740
I'm going to combine them, so since were being simple. Why

34
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,080
don't we try doing something simple for combining. Let's

35
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,210
imagine, Michael, that we're doing a regression. What's kind of

36
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,250
the simplest thing you could do if you have

37
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,240
ten different rules which tell you, how you should be

38
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,080
predicting some new data point? What's the

39
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,490
simplest thing you could imagine doing with it?

40
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,390
>> So, okay, so each of them spits out a number. I guess if we kind

41
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,070
of equally believe in each of them, a

42
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,530
reasonable thing to do would be to average.

43
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,140
>> Great. So, a very simple way of combining, in the case of

44
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,720
regression, would be to average them. We'll simply take the mean. And by

45
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,350
the way, why wouldn't we equally believe in each of them. Each one

46
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,890
of them learned over a random subset of the data. You have no reason.

47
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,280
>> Well.
>> To believe

48
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,008
one's better than the other.

49
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,925
>> There's a couple of reasons. One ,it could be a

50
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:12,250
bad random subset. I don't know how I would measure that.

51
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,640
>> I could be a good random subset.

52
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,210
>> Yeah. Then we'd want, we'd want that to count more in

53
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,220
the mean. But, but I guess what I was thinking more in terms

54
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,410
of maybe for some of the subsets you know, it gets more

55
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,650
error than others or it uses more complex rule than others or something.

56
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,560
>> I could imagine that. Actually maybe we can explore how this sort of idea

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,310
might go wrong. Let's, let's do that. Maybe we can do that with the quiz.

58
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,130
You like quizzes, right?

59
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,370
>> They're important.
