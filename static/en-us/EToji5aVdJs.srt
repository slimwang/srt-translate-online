1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,014
We'll add one to both sides to complete the square for the x terms. And we'll

2
00:00:04,014 --> 00:00:08,886
add 4 to both sides to complete the square for the y terms. Nice thinking if

3
00:00:08,886 --> 00:00:13,359
you got those numbers. Remember to complete the square, we need to add b over 2

4
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:19,242
squared. The b value is the coefficient in front of the single x term. Notice

5
00:00:19,242 --> 00:00:25,496
that we just have x to the first power. So that means b must equal 2 here. So

6
00:00:25,496 --> 00:00:31,057
we'll have 2 divided by 2 which equals 1 and 1 squared is positive 1. So we add

7
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:35,400
this to the left hand side and the right hand side of our equation. For the y

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,424
terms, our b value is 4. So we'll have 4 divided by 2 which equals 2 and we'll

9
00:00:41,424 --> 00:00:46,780
square it to get 4. This is what we add to the left and to the right.
