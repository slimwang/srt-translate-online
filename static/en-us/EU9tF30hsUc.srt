>> Let's move away from solving systems of equations and think about which

2
00:00:03,552 --> 00:00:07,455
method would work best. So here's a system of equations, and I want you to think

3
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:11,091
about, how should we solve this? So what do you think? Should we graph the

4
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:14,499
equations as lines and find the point of intersection? Should we use

5
00:00:14,499 --> 00:00:18,458
substitution to find the point of intersection? Or should we use elimination?

6
00:00:18,459 --> 00:00:22,633
Take some time to think about it and actually try solving it using these

7
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:25,806
different methods. You'll find out which one's best.
