00:00:04,824 --> 00:00:07,633
After writing 5,000 lines of code,
I'm finally done.

2
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:11,110
>> Hey Walter,
salami baguettes for lunch.

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,740
Is that your game that
you've been working on?

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,160
>> Yeah.
Let's grab some lunch and

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,290
I'll show you the game afterwards.

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:22,470
>> Awesome.

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:32,470
[MUSIC]

8
00:00:35,771 --> 00:00:38,460
Yeah, I mean it doesn't pretend
to be anything that it's not.

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,500
It's salami on baguette, it's awesome.

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,860
>> That's amazing.

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,930
>> So, let me show you this
game that I've been working on.

12
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,858
I think you're going to like it.

13
00:00:45,858 --> 00:00:47,289
>> Awesome.

14
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:51,378
>> Wait, hold on a second.

15
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:53,044
[SOUND] It's crashing.

16
00:00:53,044 --> 00:00:55,340
I promise you this was
working about 30 minutes ago.

17
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,808
It doesn't even look like any
lines of code have changed.

18
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:58,744
What!

19
00:00:58,744 --> 00:01:04,617
[SOUND]
[SOUND]

20
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:06,423
>> Well, that was a frustrating

21
00:01:06,423 --> 00:01:08,090
situation.

22
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,160
And this was just a personal project.

23
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,180
But imagine if this had happened while
working on important code at work.

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,685
Luckily, these types of
situations can be easily avoided

25
00:01:17,685 --> 00:01:20,455
using something known
as version control.

26
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:24,625
In this lesson, you'll learn to use Git,
a popular distributed version control

27
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:28,485
tool to track changes and switch
between different versions of the code.
