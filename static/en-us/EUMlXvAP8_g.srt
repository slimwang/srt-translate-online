00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,956
>> In one of our earlier quizzes when you were deciding which curves were

2
00:00:03,956 --> 00:00:08,376
parabolas and which ones weren't, we saw the equation y equals 3x squared plus

3
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:12,420
2x. We know very well by now that if we want to find the x intercept of this

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,704
equation we need to start by setting y equal to 0, and then the next step after

5
00:00:16,704 --> 00:00:20,920
that will be to try to get the expression on the right hand side, with the x's

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,515
in it, into a form where we have one factor multiplied by another factor. Where

7
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:29,655
both factors have an x to the 1st power in them. And in fact, you already know

8
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:34,118
how to do this. All this involves is factoring. Remember, that means looking for

9
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:38,470
a common factor between terms, and putting it outside a set of parenthesis so

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,646
that it will And multiply in. So, what is a way that we could rewrite this

11
00:00:42,646 --> 00:00:47,321
equation by pulling out a common factor that both of these terms have. Please

12
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:50,659
fill in one of those factors here, and another one here.
