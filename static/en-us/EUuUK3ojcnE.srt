1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,740
So a few times in my career I've ended
up in situations where we've had to

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,570
pivot and it's mostly based on the
assumptions that we had or the theory

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,540
that we were trying to test just
didn't work out for whatever reason.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,360
Or a partner had a different opinion.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,130
So, in one of my tech startups we did
a technical demo that failed and so

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,650
we pivoted into a new
technical direction.

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,370
Based on the technology we had

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,530
which also didn't work out
the way we had anticipated.

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,060
So we pivoted again and

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,220
ended up acquiring a small company in
business and trying to work that into

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,990
our core business which turned
out not to be lucrative so

12
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,270
that changed the conditions upon
which we were operating our business.

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,481
So we pivoted again into
a completely different category of

14
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:51,114
technology business while still
trying to leverage that initial

15
00:00:51,114 --> 00:00:53,400
seed of technology that we had.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,772
The perception for
me was we were running amok,

17
00:00:55,772 --> 00:00:59,300
we were just like wildly thrashing
around and it wasn't acceptable.

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,709
So, at that point I stepped back
personally and just sort of took stock

19
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,535
of what we had and what I believed in at
that point, went back to my core values.

20
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:13,855
And went back to our first idea and
decided on a reimplementation of that.

21
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:16,935
And that actually gave the company
the engineering direction

22
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:19,235
it needed to launch a product.

23
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:21,405
It only took six years.
