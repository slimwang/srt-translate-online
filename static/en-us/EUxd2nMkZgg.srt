00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,350
So now that we talked a little bit
about the relational data model, and

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,990
talked about tables, and
talked about keys, and so on.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,440
So let's try a quiz.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,590
Two tuples in a relation or

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:16,590
table, we are also calling this a table,
can have the same primary key value.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,360
Is that possible or not?

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,840
Is it possible to have
the same exact value for

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,860
the primary key in more
than one tuple in a table?
