1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,370
There are other possible metrics,

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,340
there's a very long list
of possible metrics.

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,600
But I just wanted to throw down one
more, which is, let's say that we want

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,590
to pull down a non-near optimal arm,
epsilon, no more than tau double

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:17,380
prime k, epsilon, delta times
with high probability, 1-delta.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,040
So basically the number of times that
you pull an arm that's not nearly

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,160
optimal is small.

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,150
And there's over no
particular time window.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,070
It could be over a very very long
time window, but the number of pulls,

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,260
the number of mistaken
pulls is really small.

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,810
>> Okay, well that makes sense so

12
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,570
basically I want to minimize
my mistakes kind of.

13
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,490
>> Yes,
that's a good way to think about it or

14
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,000
at least bound, this is mistake bound.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,360
This is number of reward and this is,
you know, identifying your output more.

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,960
And it turns out that all of these
guys are actually equivalent

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,270
in a sense that an algorithm for one
gives us an algorithm for the other two.

18
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,550
>> Oh, well that's good.

19
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,020
>> All right,
let me tell you about that then.
