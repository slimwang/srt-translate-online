There are three x intercepts. Which we can see are the points a, c, and e. Now,

2
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:08,064
remember that a function is said to be increasing if its slope is positive.

3
00:00:08,064 --> 00:00:12,354
Because that means that the y values, or the values of the function, the output,

4
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:16,603
are continuing to increase in value. And the graph goes from having a positive

5
00:00:16,603 --> 00:00:21,500
slope to having a negative slope. At the point b. That's the point of transition

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,708
from the function increasing, to the function decreasing. And the function

7
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:30,158
continues to decrease, until point d. At which point it switches from decreasing

8
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:32,232
to increasing. Awesome job.
