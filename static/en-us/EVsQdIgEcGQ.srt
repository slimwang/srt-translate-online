1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
So what does recognition entail?

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,920
Well it's actually many different tasks.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,780
One example is somebody might show
you a particular area and say,

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,350
you know, is that a lamp?

5
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,442
Okay, and that's verification.

6
00:00:11,442 --> 00:00:15,270
And the, this particular case what
I mean is that it's verification of

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,730
a general class.

8
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,260
Okay?

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,310
Is this thing a lamp?

10
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,470
We'll get to identification in a minute.

11
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,520
Another possibility is you might say,
are there any people here?

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,000
And that would be detection.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,740
That is, I haven't told you
where in the image to look,

14
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,440
I just want to know are there
any people in this scene.

15
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,130
Another is,
I might have a specific instance.

16
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,840
And I might show you an example,
and say is that Potala Palace?

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,420
That's in this particular case,
of a location, of a thing.

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,617
Sometimes, identification,
we all know, is in faces, right?

19
00:00:41,617 --> 00:00:43,916
I show you and say,
you know, is this Megan?

20
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,302
And you say, no,
that's not nearly as nice as Megan.

21
00:00:46,302 --> 00:00:49,100
But anyway, that's identification.

22
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,940
A more interesting question is what
we'll loosely call categorization,

23
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,680
all right?

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,770
So you're generally putting out a label.

25
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,240
You know, here we have this label that
in the background there are mountains,

26
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,220
and there's trees over here,

27
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,720
there's people here, vendors, this thing
was a street lamp, these are buildings.

28
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,995
And this is what's referred to
as object categorization and

29
00:01:05,995 --> 00:01:07,620
we're going to talk more about that.

30
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,440
But we might also want to
just label the entire scene.

31
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,460
Say you know, this is an outdoor
city where people go and buy stuff.

32
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,460
All right, so that was also,
would entail some form of recognition.
