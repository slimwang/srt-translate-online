1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,310
Before we import our first project,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,680
let's take a peek at
what we just downloaded.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,790
You'll see a ton of folders.

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,510
Each one contains a LibGDX project
that's either some demo code,

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,080
the starting point of an exercise,
or our solution to an exercise.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:15,890
That's right.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,920
All the answers to the coding exercises
are right here in the course code,

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,759
just means we can give you
a tougher problems, right?

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,070
Each folder is numbered by
where it goes in the course.

10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,730
So the demo code for
the first lesson, second level,

11
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,182
which is what we're doing right now,
is in 1.2.

12
00:00:31,182 --> 00:00:33,110
If we open up this folder,

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,050
it looks like there's a ton
of different files in here.

14
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,520
But just staring at this file list for

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,400
a moment,
the word that pops out is gradle?

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,318
Let's see there's build.gradle,
gradle.properties, a gradle folder,

17
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:46,260
a bunch of other stuff.

18
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,310
What is this gradle thing?

19
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,035
I thought we were working with LibGDX?
