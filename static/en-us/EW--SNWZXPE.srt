00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,878
So, first, I have some terminology. This is called an infinite loop, and it's

2
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:06,221
pretty clear why. The loop just keeps on going forever. Let's see what

3
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:09,104
happened. We compute the interest. And actually, that's the same computation

4
00:00:09,104 --> 00:00:13,140
that we had before. It's perfectly normal. We increment the year. We print out

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,044
the result. And you've seen this happening over and over. So the problem must

6
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:20,233
have been with the condition here. Hm. We wanted to keep one going, while the

7
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:24,112
balance didn't reach the million dollars. It clearly overshot the million

8
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:26,964
dollars, so the problem must lie in here and why don't you give it a try to fix

9
00:00:26,964 --> 00:00:28,189
it.
