1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,030
So you're going to need to update the save profile

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,020
method in the Conference API class so that, see here where

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,860
we get the profile, every time we get the profile

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,780
we create new one. Instead of doing that what we need

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,180
to do is check if the profile's already in the

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,250
data store if it is, get it out, if it isn't

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,310
create a new one and then set the values all passed

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,390
in by the form. The values that the form doesn't pass

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,800
in for new entity, use the default

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,930
values and if the entity already existed, then

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,720
leave the existing values in the properties. You're also going to need to add a

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,960
method in the profile class called update

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,015
profile that takes a display name and the

14
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:44,700
t-shirt size and updates them. If they

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,320
haven't changed. That is if they aren't now.
