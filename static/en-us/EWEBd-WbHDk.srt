00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It turns out that the density of primes is such that

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
the number of primes below some number X

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
is proportional to X divided by the natural log of X.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So this is log base E.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And I won't attempt to prove this.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'll resort to proof by intimidation.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This was conjectured by Gauss and then Legendre

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and proven later.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And that means that the probability--if we pick some random number,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the probability that that number is prime

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
is approximately 1 over the natural log of X.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So the question is: how many guesses do we expect to need

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to find a prime number that's around 100 decimal digits long?

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And in computing this, you should assume that this probability

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that a random X is prime is equal to 1 over the natural log of X

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
even though this is an approximation.
