00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,965
>> We know that either this factor needs to equal 0, or this factor needs to

2
00:00:03,965 --> 00:00:08,173
equal 0, to make this entire expression on the left side equal to 0. So that

3
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:12,254
means we can either have the equation x minus 4 equals 0, or we can have the

4
00:00:12,254 --> 00:00:13,919
equation x minus 28 equals 0.
