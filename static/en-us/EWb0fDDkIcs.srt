00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,140
In past lectures,

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,200
we have talked about the whole
concept of image transformation.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,270
That is taking an image and
being able to transform it.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,940
One standard way of doing that was by
doing filtering and of course what we

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,140
talked about was image warping, or
transformation in the last lecture.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,330
Image filtering was aimed at taking the
information of the intensity values and

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,650
changing it.

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,900
While image warping or

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,340
image transformation was basically
changing the number of rows or

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,110
columns off the image, that basically
means the range of the function f,

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:34,650
in case of filtering, we were basically
changing the domain of the function.

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,490
So, just a recap, image filtering was
when we basically took an image, and

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,060
changed the range of the image, that is,

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,420
the intensity values to be
able to kind of change it.

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,090
In this case,
I've made it much more whiter.

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,400
And image warping or
transformation, basically,

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,400
we applied a functions
actually would change the,

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,510
the size of the image itself, the range
of the domain of the image would,

19
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,755
in this instance, means the number
of rows, the number of columns.

20
00:01:00,755 --> 00:01:04,765
Domain basically,
is inside the size of the image itself,

21
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,395
while the range was
the values of the intensity.

22
00:01:07,395 --> 00:01:10,325
So, basically, now we're actually
applying this to insides,

23
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:13,065
while in this case, we're applying it
to the function of the image itself.
