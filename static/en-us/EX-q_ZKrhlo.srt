1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,850
Big O-notation is also sometimes called Landau notation, named after

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,600
the German mathematician--Edmund Landau.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,740
He didn't invent the notation, which was done several years before him

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:18,700
by another German mathematician called Paul Bachman, but he popularized it in the 20th century.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:25,040
In a way, this is actually quite ironic that you should have popularized a notation that

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,030
contains so much approximation as big O-notation because Edmund Landau was actually known

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,690
as one of the most exact and pedantic mathematicians.

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,800
His goal was to be uncompromisingly rigorous.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,710
In his lectures that he used to given, he even had an assistant who always attended his lectures

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,540
and was instructed to interrupt him if he even omitted the slightest detail.

11
00:00:48,540 --> 99:59:59,999
It's interesting that he introduced a notation that omits all of the details.
