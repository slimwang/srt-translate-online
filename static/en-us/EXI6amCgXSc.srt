00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,019
Here in Spotify if I go into your
music I see a table of playlists.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,830
Then if I drill down into one of those
playlists, I see a table of songs.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,180
So I have a hierarchy of table views and

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,750
the back button lets
me retrace my steps.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,340
Here this custom right bar button
lets me edit my playlists.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,400
In the playlist table the right
bar button brings up a model of

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,050
actions that can be taken on a song.
