1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,755
When you substituted in for p, you should have gotten negative 11, 1 and

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:11,274
negative 11 for solutions. Since we found that f of negative 2 is negative, and

3
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:16,111
f of 0 is positive, then we can conclude that the function has a 0 between

4
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:23,104
negative 2 and 0. And likewise, between f of 0 and f of 2.
