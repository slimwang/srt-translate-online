00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,750
If you've taken the OMS class in high
performance computer architecture,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,630
then you might already know
the answer to this question.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,490
Let's say I give you two
possible chip designs.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,710
The first one runs at 4 gigahertz and
consumes 64 watts of dynamic power.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,900
Let's also suppose that if you
run some program on this chip,

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,260
it finishes in a given time,
let's call it t.

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,300
Now suppose I give you
a different design,

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,280
the main difference is that it's slower,
it runs at 1 gigahertz instead of 4.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,820
Now I want you to tell me two things,

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,040
what is the dynamic power of chip
two and what is it's execution time?

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,250
In terms of execution
time on the first chip.

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,520
For the dynamic power
consumed of chip two.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,600
Express your answer in watts.

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,770
And for time, again, express your
answer symbolically in terms of T1.

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,675
As needed, assume that all other factors
between the two designs are equal.
