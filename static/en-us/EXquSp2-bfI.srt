1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,583
Another hypothesis regarding the biological factors that play a role in

2
00:00:03,583 --> 00:00:08,842
schizophrenia is the dopamine hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:13,688
schizophrenia involves excess dopamine activity. One reason this hypothesis

4
00:00:13,688 --> 00:00:17,104
came about was from the observation of individuals who overdose on major

5
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:23,104
stimulants like methamphetamine and cocaine. These individuals, if you recall

6
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:26,642
from our lesson on drugs, have similar behaviors and cognitions as those

7
00:00:26,642 --> 00:00:31,882
individuals with schizophrenia. Indeed, physicians have reported that it is

8
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:35,776
difficult upon initial observation to determine whether somebody is

9
00:00:35,776 --> 00:00:42,000
schizophrenic, or whether they are overdosing from a major stimulant. Another

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,596
factor supporting the idea of the dopamine hypothesis, in regards to

11
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:49,564
schizophrenia, was that drugs that block dopamine appear to be effective in

12
00:00:49,564 --> 00:00:55,080
treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. However, there are some

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,714
problems with the dopamine hypothesis. And we'll discuss that further in our

14
00:00:58,714 --> 00:01:02,738
next lesson, when we discuss treatments for mental disorders. Another neural

15
00:01:02,738 --> 00:01:06,354
transmitter that does seem to play a role in schizophrenia is Glutamate. It

16
00:01:06,354 --> 00:01:10,897
appears that Glutamate deficiencies may also explain the symptoms of

17
00:01:10,897 --> 00:01:16,185
schizophrenia. That is, Glutamate is important in learning, memory, neural

18
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:21,153
processing and brain development. And it allows us to make some stimuli more

19
00:01:21,153 --> 00:01:26,422
important than others. Therefore, glutamate is crucial to selective attention,

20
00:01:26,422 --> 00:01:32,130
such as focusing attention on some items of information while ignoring others.

21
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,034
And it may explain why these individuals have difficulty with sustained

22
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:41,838
attention, cognitive control, and working memory. Now let's go back to Lauren

23
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:45,095
with the brain regions associated with schizophrenia.
