00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,540
Some of you may remember Microsoft's first entry

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,390
in the world of PCs, with their operating

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,410
system called DOS, or disc operating system, and

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,160
the structure of DOS looks as shown here.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,290
And at first glance, at least visually, You

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,930
might think that this structure is very similar

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,190
to what I showed you as a monolithic

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,850
structure before. What is the difference you see

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,220
in this structure? First I would like you to think about it

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,400
yourself before we go any further, so here is a question for you.
