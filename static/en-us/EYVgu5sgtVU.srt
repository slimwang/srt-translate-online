00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,666
Alright, so hopefully you used some tools to make that a little bit simpler for

2
00:00:04,678 --> 00:00:09,109
you. If we load up the developer tools here, we can see that we've already got a

3
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:13,577
syntax error. And if we go over, and click right here on line 28, and it'll take

4
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:17,945
us right to where the offending error is. You can see that it actually doesn't

5
00:00:17,957 --> 00:00:22,698
technically take us to the error. It takes us to the line after. Sometimes these kinds of tools

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,146
will get you close and then you'll have to figure it out from there.

7
00:00:27,158 --> 00:00:31,465
So, the problem is right here: you see that local user ID

8
00:00:31,477 --> 00:00:35,718
colon -1 doesn't have a comma after it, it just ends and since it was

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,581
expecting a comma, well Javascript inserts a semicolon, and that causes issues.

10
00:00:40,684 --> 00:00:43,134
So let's go ahead and fix that one. Okay.

11
00:00:43,137 --> 00:00:47,718
So if we insert that comma there, and then reload the page, we get our next

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,431
syntax error at line 103 and the error here is that functions expect

13
00:00:51,443 --> 00:00:55,557
parenthesis after them where the perameters are. Even if it doesn't take any

14
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:59,742
perameters it still expects parenthesis here. Let's go ahead and add those in.

15
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:04,305
And again reload the page. And we get to our next error. And this one is way

16
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:09,820
down on line 207. Now this is maybe a little bit harder to see, but the problem

17
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:15,230
is right here, "this:currentTick" should have a dot, as see down here, rather

18
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:20,960
than a colon, since we use dots to access member methods and variables. Okay, so

19
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:26,169
now that we've fixed this here, and then reload, we get to another error on 318.

20
00:01:26,274 --> 00:01:30,792
And here we can see on line 318 that we have a comma here, where normally we

21
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:35,619
would use a colon to specify a member method. So, if we fix that and then reload

22
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:40,378
the page, we can see that we don't have any syntax errors left. And, those are

23
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,847
the only ones that we put in. So, you can see that it was a lot easier to go

24
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:50,053
through the developer tools and fix these things as necessary, as it pointed it

25
00:01:50,065 --> 00:01:54,947
out to us, rather than trying to walk through the code line-by-line manually.

26
00:01:55,055 --> 00:01:59,444
So, I hope that shows how useful it is to have the proper tools on hand.
