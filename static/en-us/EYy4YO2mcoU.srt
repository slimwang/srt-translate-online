00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,590
One example of a programming language that sits on top of such a north-bound API

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,880
is Frenetic, which is a SQL-Like query language. For example, Frenetic would

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,390
allow a programmer to count the number

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,930
of bytes, grouped by destination Mac address

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,870
and report the updates to these counters

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,360
every 60 seconds. The group by statement.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,790
The group by statement allows a grouping

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,570
of counts by the destination mac address. Where

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,310
allows restrictions to only count trafic coming from

10
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,520
a web server coming in on a particular

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,590
port and every specifies that the results of

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,960
this query should only be returned every 60

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,415
seconds. More information about Frenetic is available at

14
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:50,470
frenetic-lang.org. And in the course, we'll actually going

15
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,760
to use a language called Pyretic that is based on the

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,920
same underlying theory as Frenetic, except that it's embedded in Python.
