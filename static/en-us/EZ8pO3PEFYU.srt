00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,590
Waiting for a computer game
player to make a turn is no fun.

2
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:04,910
After two seconds of waiting,

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,060
a human player is likely to
start thinking of other things.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,560
We really need a way to
choose a move quickly.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,275
>> Well, we can't search to end game,
but how deep can we search?

6
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:18,035
>> Let's assume, again, that we can
search 10 to the 9th nodes per second.

7
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:22,195
So in two seconds, we can actually
search 2 times 10 to the 9th nodes.

8
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:23,580
So I need to solve the equation,

9
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:26,594
8 to the x is less than
2 times 10 to the 9th.

10
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:30,309
We can do this by taking
log base 8 on both sides.

11
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:32,524
>> That log base 8 is pretty annoying.

12
00:00:32,524 --> 00:00:35,144
>> Yep,
time to bring out some old math skills.

13
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:41,170
We know that log a of x is equal to
the log b of x over the log b of a.

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,340
So we can use that formula
to solve our problem.

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,260
We'll use log base 10 here for
convenience.

16
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:51,393
So we end up with x is
less than log base 10 of 2

17
00:00:51,393 --> 00:00:55,540
times 10 to the 9th
over log base 10 of 8.

18
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,500
And we end up with x
being less than 10.3.

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,576
>> So we should be okay if we
only search 10 levels deep?

20
00:01:01,576 --> 00:01:04,325
>> Provided that our estimate
of a branching factor of 8,

21
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:05,442
on average, is good.

22
00:01:05,442 --> 00:01:08,459
To be on the safe side,
let's only go to depth 9.

23
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:12,799
This idea of only going as far as we
think we can to safely meet our deadline

24
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,186
is called a depth-limited search.
