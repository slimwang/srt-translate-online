00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] So to start with some lingo about unsupervised learning.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you look at this as a probabilist, you're given data, and

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we interpretively assume the data is IID,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which means identically distributed and independently drawn

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
from the same distribution.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So a good chunk of unsupervised learning

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
seeks to recover the underlying--the density of

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
probability distribution that generated the data.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's called density estimation.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
As we find out our methods for clustering,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
our versions of density estimation

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
using what's called mixture models.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Dimensionality reduction is also a method

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
for doing density estimation,

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and there are many others.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Unsupervised learning can be applied to find

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
structure and data.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
One of the fascinating ones that

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I believe exists is called

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
blind signals separation.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Suppose you are given a microphone, and

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
two people simultaneously talk, and you're

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
record the joint of both of those speakers.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Blind source separation or blind signal separation

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
addresses the question of can you recover

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
those two speakers and filter

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
the data into two separate streams.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
One for each speaker.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now this is a really complicated unsupervised

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
learning task, but is one of the many things

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
that don't require target signals as

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
unsupervised learning yet make for

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
really interesting learning problems.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This can be construed as an example

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
of what's called factor analysis where each

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
speaker is a factor in the drawing signal that your microphone records.

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
There are many other examples of unsupervised learning.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I will show you a few in a second.
