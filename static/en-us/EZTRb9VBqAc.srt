1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,635
Now we're using the t distribution, and our sample mean falls right here in the

2
00:00:03,635 --> 00:00:09,702
middle. We want to find the price that corresponds to a t statistic of negative

3
00:00:09,702 --> 00:00:18,643
2.064 and positive 2.064. In other words, what value is 2.064 standard errors

4
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:26,445
above 1700? Where one standard error is s divided by root n. Try and calculate

5
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:29,190
the confidence interval, and this will be a good review of lesson eight as

6
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:35,303
well. And remember, 1700 should be right in the middle of these two values.
