00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
On the more philosophical level, when delta debugging returns, is not only to simply itself

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but is also to cause for the failure.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What is the cause anyway?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Assume i have a window and here comes a ball flying to the window and the window breaks.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You would think later that the ball is the cause for the window to break.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But why is it the cause? This is so called counterfactual definition of causality

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
which is the most used in our context. It works as follows:

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We have two events, and A comes before B.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Say A, is the ball flying towards the window? and B, is the window shattering?

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We now say that A causes B, if B had not occurred if A had not occurred.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Applied to our example, we can say that the ball causes the window to shatter

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
if the window had not shatter if the ball has not arrived which actually is true.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
With the ball, the window shatters. Without the ball, the window does not shatter.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And since the ball precede the shattering, everything is in place to say

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
that the ball caused the window to shatter.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If this sounds complicated, we haven't seen much.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Causality is one of the most disputed subject in Philosophy.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Some philosophers are even saying that causality does not really exist. It's just an illusion.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
For our purposes; however, that is within debugging,

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
this counterfactual definition does a good job.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
First, we have the ball then we have the window crashing forward.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
First, we have the defect and then we have the failure.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So why does delta debugging returned cause?

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Simply because there might be a large set of events that all could or could not contribute to the failure.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The sun is shining. The clouds are in the sky. There's a nice tree along.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And what areas that none of this is relevant for shattering the window.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Only the ball by simplifying the scenery towards a single element

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
that is responsible for the test to fail, delta debugging returns the cause.
