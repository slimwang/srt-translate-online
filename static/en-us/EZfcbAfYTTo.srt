1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is 1 + 1 is 2,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and so that's even, so it'd be a positive payoff to E.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
1 + 2 is 3, that's odd, so it'd be a -3.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Similarly, 2 +1 is 3, which is odd.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So, -3, 2 + 2 is 4.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's a positive payoff.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now E is maximizing,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
so E would prefer 2 here

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and would prefer 4 here.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And now O is minimizing,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
so O would prefer 2 here.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And notice what we've done here is that

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
we're trying to figure out what the utility of the game is

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
to E, and the true game,

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
both players move simultaneously.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Over here, we've handicapped E.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And over here, we handicapped O.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The true value of the game must be somewhere in between there,

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
so we can say that the utility to E must be

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
less than or equal to 2, which is the value here,

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and greater than or equal to -3, which is the value here.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We've narrowed it down to some degree, but we still haven't nailed down

23
00:01:08,000 --> 99:59:59,999
exactly what the utility of the game is.
