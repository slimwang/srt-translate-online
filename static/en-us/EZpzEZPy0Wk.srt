00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
[Thrun] The answer is approximately 0.0142,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and it is an exercise in expanding this term using Bayes' rule,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
using total probability, which I'll just do for you.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Using Bayes' rule, you can transform this into P of H given R comma S

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
times P of R given S over P of H given S.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We observe the conditional independence of R and S

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to simplify this to just P of R,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and the denominator is expanded by folding in R and not R,

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
P of H given R comma S

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
times P of R plus P of H given not R and S

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
times P of not R, which is total probability.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We can now read off the numbers from the tables over here,

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,000
which gives us 1 times 0.01 divided by this expression

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
that is the same as the expression over here, so 0.01 plus this thing over here,

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
which you can find over here to be 0.7, times this guy over here,

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
which is 1 minus the value over here, 0.99,

17
00:01:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which gives us approximately 0.0142.
