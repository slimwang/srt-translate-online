00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,755
The origin is the point 0,0, which is right here, right in the center of our

2
00:00:03,767 --> 00:00:07,682
axis. And, of course, we can write it as an ordered pair as well. Both the

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,158
x-coordinate and the y-coordinate are equal to 0. We saw earlier that this is

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,559
the point from which we started counting our other coordinates. So, this is sort

5
00:00:16,571 --> 00:00:20,838
of like homebase. It's our reference point for figuring out distances to all

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,244
other points on our plane.
