00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,340
So we started out this course using functions. In

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,590
lesson one, we built a couple of different projects. Then,

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,810
we came across a scenario where using functions didn't

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,360
quite work really well. This was when we were trying

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,744
to build a movie website. This led us to

6
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:18,752
lesson two, where we were introduced two classes and we

7
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:22,708
built a bunch of different projects using classes. Here in

8
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,480
lesson three we will write our very first class, and

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,345
we will return to our movie website example. Let's begin. Now the

10
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:32,897
output of the program we are about to build will look a

11
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:38,035
little bit like this. A movie website with all of your favorite

12
00:00:38,035 --> 00:00:42,070
movies,.and if you click on one of them its trailer will play.

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:49,583
[MUSIC]

14
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,020
Let's build this.
