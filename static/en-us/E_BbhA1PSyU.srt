00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,719
Let's take the look at the
implementation, of an optional method,

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:04,939
we've got in the content provider.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,220
Anyone out there who has
done work with SQLite,

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,430
knows that putting a bunch of
inserts into a single transaction is

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,040
much faster than inserting
them individually.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,100
BulkInsert allows us to do that.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,900
The default implementation,
just calls insert a bunch of times.

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,520
But, we can wrap it in a transaction,
if we implement it ourselves.

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,270
Note that we've only added support for
weather forecast transactions here,

10
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,930
since they are the only
ones we insert in bulk.

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,320
We start by calling db.beginTransaction.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,860
For each of the content values
passed in, we insert and

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,190
update the number of records inserted.

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,770
When we're done,
we set the transaction to be successful.

15
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,092
And then rely on the finally
statement endTransaction.

16
00:00:46,092 --> 00:00:49,140
Note, that if we do not set
the transaction to be successful,

17
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,460
the records will not be committed
when we call endTransaction.
