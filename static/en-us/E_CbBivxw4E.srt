00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,512
The roots of this parabola are 1 plus or minus i times the square root of 21

2
00:00:04,512 --> 00:00:08,996
over 7. This is a simple case of using the quadratic formula to solve, and

3
00:00:08,996 --> 00:00:13,802
actually I had to do this problem way earlier on in the lesson. You may not have

4
00:00:13,802 --> 00:00:18,347
even remembered it. And this time you got to do it totally on your own. And

5
00:00:18,347 --> 00:00:23,157
you've also got to write the answer in the complex notation that you know about

6
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:23,459
now.
