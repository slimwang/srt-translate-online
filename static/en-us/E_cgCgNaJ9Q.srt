1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:07,032
Well, clearly this is an admissable heuristic because the distance to the goal is strictly underestimated.

2
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:14,666
From here it would take one step; from here it'll take one-two steps, so the answer is yes.

3
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:24,032
Now, to understand a star, let me also draw the G function for the relevant part of this table.

4
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:32,566
Clearly, G is zero over here. To understand which node to expand, this one or this one, let's project the G function,

5
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:40,166
which is one, and we'll see that B+1 is smaller than four plus one.

6
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:47,699
Therefore, this is the second node to expand, which is B1.

7
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:55,366
Now, let me, for the next step, expand the G function from this guy here, two and two.

8
00:00:55,367 --> 00:01:08,032
So two plus two is four, versus three plus two is five. So we expand this node next, which is C1.

9
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:14,199
And finally, the G function from here would go three and three.

10
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:23,532
Three plus one is better than three plus two, so we will expand D1 next.

11
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:35,566
And notice how, in the sum of G and H, this node over here, which has a total of four, is better than any other node that is unexpanded.

12
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:44,333
So in particular, four plus one is five, and three plus two is five as well, and two plus three is five as well. So this is the next one to expand.
