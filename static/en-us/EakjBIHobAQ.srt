00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,766
The answer to both of these questions is most likely yes. Clearly language is

2
00:00:03,766 --> 00:00:06,886
the most important means of communicating our thought and ideas, but they're

3
00:00:06,886 --> 00:00:11,528
not necessarily the same, as these two examples demonstrate. We might have an

4
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:15,080
idea in one language that we can't quite translate to another. Or you might

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,056
have a lot of thoughts going through your head, but you can't quite get them

6
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:22,093
out into words. That shows that there is a slight disconnect between thought

00:00:22,093 --> 00:00:25,180
and language. But let's go to Susan for a little bit more on this.
