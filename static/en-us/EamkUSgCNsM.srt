1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We're actually going to do some programming, and we're going to add a feature to ASCII Chan.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you don't remember ASCII Chan is, we started using that in Unit 3, I believe.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It looks something like this.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We just have two inputs on a simple form, and we can insert in some ASCII art into the box here.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Then when we submit it, we see our art here on our page,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
if we were to reload this page, we would show the 10 most recent pieces of artwork submitted.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Obviously, this site is going to be a big deal--a big social community.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'd like to add some features to it.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What I'd like to do is to draw over here a map that shows on the map

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
where the most recent submissions came from,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
so that when you come to ASCHII Chan you can see what a global community it is.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We have to do a couple things. Let's talk about them.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
One thing we're going to need to do is figure out where the user submitting is from.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're going to need some sort of service to convert the request IP into coordinates.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
For this we'll be using a service I just found called "hostip.info," which is a handy little website.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll show you right now. I found this by googling.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Basically, you go to hostip.info and for any IP address, they will tell you where it's located.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
They also have an API that has very simple documentation.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Basically, if we go to api.hostip.info and include the IP address in a get parameter,

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
they'll give us some XML with location data, and I'll show you what that looks like.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
For IP--their example IP--we get all this information,

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
including city, country, country abbreviation, and what we're really after--some coordinates.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Here we've got the longitude and latitude.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This will be a really handle service that we'll be using.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We also want to draw a map, and for this we'll be using Google Maps.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Google Maps has a really handy service called "static maps,"

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
which is where we can basically make a URL that draws a make with markers on it.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll show you where the documentation for that lives.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That is here. It's called the Static Maps API version 2.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If we just scroll down here to a quick example, we can see the type of thing we can build.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Given this URL, it would load this image.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If we were to just copy this URL here and load it in a new tab,

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
we would get that image with the markers,

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and these markers are all defined in the URL itself.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's going to be a pretty cool, handy service.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What I want is a map just like this, and I want it to appear right here,

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,277
and I want it to have the location of the most recent submissions.
