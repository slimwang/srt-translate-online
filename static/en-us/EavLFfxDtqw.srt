00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,629
We now know a lot about color, but nothing yet about materials. Say, we have a

2
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:09,216
red ball. How do we make the GPU compute how the lights in the scene and the

3
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:13,856
ball's material interact, so that the ball looks real. When performing

4
00:00:13,856 --> 00:00:18,548
interactive rendering, the standard way to think about a material's appearance

5
00:00:18,548 --> 00:00:23,309
is as a few different components added together, emissive, ambient, diffuse, and

6
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:27,548
specular. The idea of the emissive term is that it's for coloring glowing

7
00:00:27,548 --> 00:00:31,848
objects. For example, a lightbulb has its own color and other light sources

8
00:00:31,848 --> 00:00:35,548
don't really affect it. In reality, the emissive term is simply a way to add in

9
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:39,827
some constant color regardless of the lighting conditions. The second component,

10
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:44,200
ambient, is a fudge factor. Something added in so objects look better especially

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,725
in areas that are not directly lit. You'll see it in various systems controlled

12
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:52,080
in various ways. When all is said and done, the ambient term helps compute a

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,323
constant color value that is added to the fragment's final color value. The

14
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:58,800
emissive and ambient terms are kept separate, as they fulfill different

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,110
functions, and often have different controls. For example, three.js allows you

16
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,390
to set an ambient light that affects all materials with an ambient term.

17
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:11,845
Remember that we made a simplification with lights in a scene. We assume photons

18
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:15,952
come only from lights, and don't bounce around. In reality, photons would

19
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:20,036
reflect from the floor to the bottom of the sphere to our eye. However, with our

20
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:24,392
assumption, the lower part of the sphere doesn't get any light and so would look

21
00:01:24,392 --> 00:01:28,408
black. The ambient term gives us at least some color in these types of areas

22
00:01:28,408 --> 00:01:31,906
instead of being entirely black. The diffuse and specular components are

23
00:01:31,906 --> 00:01:36,238
computed based on the lights in the scene. While the emissive and ambient are

24
00:01:36,238 --> 00:01:40,268
essentially independent of these, the diffuse term can be though of as a flat,

25
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:44,320
matte finish, and specular can be thought of as the shininess of an object. In

26
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,220
terms of computation, the specular term is also affected by the viewers

27
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,183
location. While the diffuse term is determined only by each lights location.
