In the last few lessons, we have learned a lot about exponential and

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,710
logarithmic functions. We have learned how to recognize their graphs, and

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,780
evaluate points on their graphs. We looked at how to manipulate exponential and

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,360
logarithmic functions, how to switch between them, and when we could not

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,830
evaluate logs, how to change their bases. Lastly, we looked at the relevance of

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,380
these functions in our daily lives. We hope you will reviewed the material in

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,020
both the practice sets and the problem sets. Best of luck to you, we know your

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:32,668
going to do well.
