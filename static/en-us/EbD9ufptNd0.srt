1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,490
Here we can see a time series plot of U.S. civilian unemployment rate over time.

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,730
The data goes all the way back to about 1950,

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,430
and all the way up until the present time.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,650
On the Y axis we have unemployment percent.

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:21,970
If you notice it tops out at around 11% and the lowest value is around 3%.

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,090
Something to always be careful of with your plots is to clearly label and

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,820
be aware of what the ranges of your data are.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,850
Both on the Y and on the X.

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,160
In this case, since we are plotting a time series,

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,260
every point is not completely independent of every other point.

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,040
The X variables here depend on one another.

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,388
Since the value at time X depends on X minus 1.

13
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:48,315
In more concrete terms,

14
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:54,474
the unemployment in 1970 is some delta from the unemployment in 1969.

15
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:59,177
And the unemployment rate in 1969 is some change from the unemployment rate

16
00:00:59,177 --> 00:01:00,030
in 1968.

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,000
Since we're trying to convey how something's changed over time, a line plot is

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,740
the most natural and easily understandable of all the chart types.
