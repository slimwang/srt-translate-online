00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I want to talk about one more vulnerability in TLS.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
That's an information leak.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now we'll assume that the encryption works fine. The handshake is good.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
All of these messages are encrypted.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But the attacker can listen in on this channel.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Assuming the attacker can't break any of the encryption

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but can observe the message on this channel,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
what does the attacker learn?
