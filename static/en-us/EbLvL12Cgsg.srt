1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, in addition to doing an and/or search,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
sometimes we can solve an abstract hierarchical task network planning problem

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
without going all the way down to the concrete steps.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's talk about how to do that.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Here we have a description of a state space.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The start state is here, and the goal state is outlined in gray here.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We have one abstract action, and we're shown a set of possible states

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
that can be reached by that abstract action,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
if we refine the abstract action, using one concrete action or another.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is like when we were dealing with belief states

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
where we would move, because we had a stochastic action,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
from one state to several possible other states.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Here we have several possible states that we'll end up with,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
not because the actions are stochastic,

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
but because we haven't decided yet which refinement we're going to use.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This would be a single step that would bring us to this belief state,

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and then when we add a second step, we get to this belief state.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Now we can check to see if we can achieve the goal with this two-step plan

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
just by checking if there is an intersection between the reachable state and the goal state.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
In this case, there is.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We know that we've achieved the goal,

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and now if we want to find a refinement that actually works,

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
the way to do it is to search backwards rather than forward.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If we search forward we'd have a large tree of possibilities,

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
but if we search backwards, we know the intersections here.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What could have brought us to here? Only this refinement.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And what could have brought is to this state? Only this refinement.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the plan that is a refinement of this abstract plan that achieves the goal.
