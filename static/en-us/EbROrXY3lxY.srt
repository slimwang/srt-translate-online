1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] And the answer is 40mm.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
With f being the unknown, we can transform this equation as follows,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and now we can plug in the things we know.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The 10 meters tall is the upper caps X,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
the distance of 100 meters is the Z,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and the 4mm projection goes over here.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And if you work this all out, it's 40mm.
