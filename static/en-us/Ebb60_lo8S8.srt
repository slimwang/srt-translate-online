1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,724
So the whole photo tourism pipeline
that we actually looked at starts with

2
00:00:03,724 --> 00:00:05,178
a bunch of input photographs.

3
00:00:05,178 --> 00:00:08,636
And actually, what's exciting in this
one is you can actually get those

4
00:00:08,636 --> 00:00:12,387
pictures from, you know, public sources
where people have taken pictures.

5
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:17,049
And of course this works very well for
well known historic sites and

6
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:18,221
tourism sites.

7
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:20,791
Using those pictures we can
actually need to do a little bit

8
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,004
of scene reconstruction.

9
00:00:22,004 --> 00:00:25,220
That is how we can actually
model the environment.

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,296
And this actually gets into a whole lot
of stuff called structure for motion and

11
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:30,270
we'll talk more about that in a bit.

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,610
So the goal here is basically
doing scene reconstruction to get

13
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,270
the 3D cloud points that are best
captured from the scene and

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,440
also locating the camera positions for
each and every one viewpoint.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,290
So, what we really need to figure out
is the relative camera positions and

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,650
the orientations of each camera,
generate a point cloud and

17
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,780
also correspondences
between all of them.

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,100
So, so far, we have looked at
information about how we can actually

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,890
understand and model relative camera
positions when we do panoramas and

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,630
also sparse correspondences.

21
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,980
But we never went towards the whole
world of trying to create a 3D geometry

22
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,140
of the scene in any of the work
that we so far have looked at.

23
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:08,848
And of course,

24
00:01:08,848 --> 00:01:12,224
a beautiful part of their work was
this interactive explorer mechanism,

25
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:15,882
if we doing track with the photographs,
annotate and all of that kind of stuff.

26
00:01:15,882 --> 00:01:17,514
I'm not going to talk much about that,
but

27
00:01:17,514 --> 00:01:19,830
we're going to showcase some
examples of this for sure.
