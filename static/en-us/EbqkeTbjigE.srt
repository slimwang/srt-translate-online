Just like Firebase, real time database,
Firebase storage provides a set of

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,429
security rules so that you can
authorize access to storage.

3
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:13,899
Let's consider an example, friendly
chat storage contains photos, and

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,539
these photos were only meant to be
sent to other friendly chat users and

5
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,239
not the whole world.

6
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:22,579
What might happen if anyone can
see all of your photos, and

7
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:24,349
maybe even change them?

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,650
What if you wanted to share a video
of your top secret prac technique for

9
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:32,280
your award winning recipe for peach
cobbler and you wanted to only share it

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,840
with your family but
instead the whole world got to see it?

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,430
Users expect that you
will protect their data.

12
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,320
Firebase Storage security gives you
the tools to keep their data safe

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,820
as well as limit what kind
of data can be stored.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,850
By now you know why data
security matters so

15
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,300
let's take a look at how fire
based storage rules work.
