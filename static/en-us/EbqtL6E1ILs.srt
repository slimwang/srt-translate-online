00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,050
The next principle is Robert Martin's dependency inversion principle,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,710
which we have seen in an earlier lesson. It says that high level modules should

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,810
not depend upon low level modules. Both should instead depend upon abstractions.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,440
This is related to inversion of control, in which normally abstraction framework

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,350
classes would make use of concrete client classes. It is the opposite to

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,670
the way that modules are structured in traditional layered architectures.

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,040
Stated another way, Martin is saying that our layering should be one of

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,180
abstraction, rather than one of control or data access. Doing so

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,500
will lead to designs in which the controlling principles are enforced at

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,140
the highest levels of our architecture
