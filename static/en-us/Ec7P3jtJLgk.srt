00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,330
There are several types of
cryptographic algorithms.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,300
The first is secret key cryptography.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,190
Here, the same key is used for
encryption and decryption.

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,270
In other words, the sender and

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,110
the receiver of the confidential
message, must use the same key.

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,790
Another type of algorithm
is public key cryptography.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,790
Here, there are two key
components that are paired or

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,130
linked together mathematically.

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,120
The public component is used for
encryption.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,229
And a private component is used for
decryption.

11
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:37,130
For example, Alice can use Bob's
public key to encrypt a message,

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,020
that only Bob can decrypt.

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,640
Because only Bob has
the corresponding private key that

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,660
will decrypt the message properly.

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,610
The private key component is
also used for signing a message.

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,835
And then, the public key component
can be used to verify the signature.

17
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:57,265
For example, Alice can send
a message using her private key, and

18
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,995
anyone knowing her public
key can verify that.

19
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:04,334
Only Alice can produce
this proper signature.
