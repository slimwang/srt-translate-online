00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,239
All right. Welcome back to computer vision today and the next couple of lessons.

2
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:09,934
We're going to just a little bit of time on the whole light reflection process

3
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:14,650
that results in photos essentially hitting our camera or our retina.

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,979
The idea this is how the physics of the imaging or

5
00:00:17,979 --> 00:00:22,690
the creation of the light that the imaging is going to make a picture of.

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,864
And there's actually a huge amount known about, and, about this area, and

7
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:31,161
it comes from both, sort of, the material science, where we study the materials,

8
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:34,568
but the big, motivator has been computer graphics, right?

9
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:38,682
Computer graphics, the idea is I have some model of of an object and

10
00:00:38,682 --> 00:00:41,642
its surface type and I have some model of the light.

11
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:45,465
And I'd like to produce an image as if you were actually looking at

12
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:46,515
the real object.

13
00:00:46,515 --> 00:00:51,052
So to do that, I have to understand how light interacts with these objects.

14
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:53,888
Now in the old days and when I say, the old days.

15
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:56,024
I mean, like 20 to 40 years ago.

16
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:58,791
There was this view that computer vision was

17
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:01,495
just inverse computer graphics, right?

18
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:04,788
I mean, computer graphics, you have model of the object and a model of light and

19
00:01:04,788 --> 00:01:05,633
you make a picture.

20
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:07,742
And computer vision was thought of as well,

21
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:11,739
given a picture, can you tell me about the light and the object that's there.

22
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:16,434
And so there was a lot of focus on recovering image prop surface properties and

23
00:01:16,434 --> 00:01:21,348
object properties and light and conditions as it's sort of an inverse problem.

24
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,252
And to do that,

25
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:26,787
we had to have a lot of understanding of the physics of how images were formed.

26
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:30,115
Now more recently in computer vision a lot of what we've talked about here,

27
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:32,767
there's been more of a focus on really the geometry of sort of

28
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:34,119
where features get located and

29
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:37,187
that relates to sort of the, the shapes of objects and the relation and

30
00:01:37,187 --> 00:01:40,355
you didn't have to worry quite so much about the precise physics.

31
00:01:40,355 --> 00:01:42,004
And then also a lot was saying,

32
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:44,939
let's lump all together, the lighting, the shape.

33
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,975
The texture, the imaging, the camera, et cetera.

34
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:51,389
We just get out pictures and we use machine learning or

35
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:54,882
recognition techniques for to trying to do labeling.

36
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:59,448
And we talked and when we will actually be talking about that in the future.

37
00:01:59,448 --> 00:02:03,499
But it is it's still important to understand something about how the physics of

38
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,620
light works with respect to making images.
