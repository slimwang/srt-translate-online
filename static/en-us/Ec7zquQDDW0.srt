1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,560
We want to solve a real problem.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,450
It's better if we could
address a real pain point and

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,109
not just nice to have feature.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,570
If you can create a real value for your
users, they will be happy to pay for it.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,020
>> Harnessing habits
leads to more revenue.

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,540
It drives a higher customer
lifetime value, and

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,189
it gives us greater
flexibility to increase prices.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,480
If you are able to
create a customer habit,

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,410
it will super charge
your monetization plan.

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,140
>> However, it's a challenge.

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,570
First, make sure users form a habit,
using your app at least once or

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,510
twice a day is a good start.

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,050
Second, identify the four
aspects of your product.

14
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,700
Triggers, actions,
rewards and investments.

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,760
In the following videos,
we will see how to identify them.
