00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,769
Let's make sure you've mastered this skill. Write these different numbers in

2
00:00:03,769 --> 00:00:07,620
scientific notation. The first is the distance from the earth to the moon. The

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,360
second is the distance light travels in a year. And this last small number is

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,089
the wavelength of red light. A wavelength of light is a measurement from the

5
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,917
crest to the crest, or a trough to a trough. If you're interested about light,

6
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:23,255
try looking some things up. Write your answers in scientific notation in these

7
00:00:23,255 --> 00:00:27,358
boxes, and don't include the unit. I've got that written for you. Also, be sure

8
00:00:27,358 --> 00:00:31,404
you don't round any of the numbers. You want the most accurate number with all

9
00:00:31,404 --> 00:00:34,004
the decimals after the decimal point. Good luck.
