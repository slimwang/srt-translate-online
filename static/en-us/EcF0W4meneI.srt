1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,979
What we need to do now is figure out how to

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:03,569
turn off or disable the stopRecordingButton.

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:06,359
We know that the stopRecordingButton

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,730
is a UIButton. But if we

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,529
look at the documentation for UIButton,

6
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:12,509
it's hard to find anything about

7
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,150
enabling or turning things on and off.

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,390
So how do we proceed? Remember that when

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,859
you look at the documentation for a

10
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,289
class like UIButton, you should always

11
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,149
check what functions and properties that

12
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,809
class inherits from its parent class.

13
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:28,829
If you scroll to the bottom of this

14
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,149
documentation, you'll find the

15
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:32,939
Relationships section, I’ll give you a hint.

16
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,439
You'll find what you're looking for

17
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:36,420
if you dig into the UIControl class

18
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,450
that the UIButton inherits from.

19
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,280
So try diving into this documentation and see

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,609
what you find.
