1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,435
These three choices are correct. At the spot where two lines cross, or

2
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:09,340
intersect, they have to go through the exact same point, which is why they are

3
00:00:09,352 --> 00:00:14,080
able to touch in the first place. So this point of intersection lies both on

4
00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:19,005
this orange line and on this purple line. They both pass through this location.

5
00:00:19,112 --> 00:00:24,383
Remember, though, that a point on a line gives us x and y values that satisfy

6
00:00:24,395 --> 00:00:29,836
the equation for that line, or in other words, make it true. If a point lies on

7
00:00:29,848 --> 00:00:35,112
both lines, then it must do that for both of those equations. That means that

8
00:00:35,124 --> 00:00:40,311
for any two lines that intersect, there's some pair of x and y values that we

9
00:00:40,323 --> 00:00:46,736
could plug into either equation, and create a true statement for each. This is

10
00:00:46,748 --> 00:00:53,456
the same thing as saying that these values create a solution to both equations.
