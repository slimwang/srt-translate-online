1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,400
NAT allows multiple networks to reuse the

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,750
same private IP address space. Let's suppose that

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,970
we have two networks. These networks might

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,220
be, for example, homes or they might be

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,090
larger networks in regions of the Internet,

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,690
where IPv4 address space is scarce, for example,

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,490
in developing regions. What NAT allows these networks

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,490
to do is reuse the same portion of

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,910
internet address space. For example, a particular, special, private IP address

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,978
space, is 192.168/16. Other private IP address space

11
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:41,118
is specified in RFC 3130. Now, obviously these two networks couldn't

12
00:00:41,118 --> 00:00:43,974
coexist on the public Internet, because routers

13
00:00:43,974 --> 00:00:46,490
wouldn't know if they got a packet destined

14
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,550
for an IP address in this space, which network the packet should be sent to.

15
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,690
What a NAT, or a Network Address

16
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,920
Translator does, is take the private IP addresses

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,150
that are behind the NAT and translate those

18
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,160
IP addresses to a single, globally visible IP

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,910
address. Now, to the rest of the Internet, network one appears to be reachable

20
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:13,140
by a single IP address, 203.178.1.1, and network two is reachable

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,820
via a single distinct global IP

22
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,155
address 133.4.1.5. Now, a host back here, say

23
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:26,790
192.168.1.10 might send a packet towards a global

24
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,090
internet destination. Now, the key behind NAT is

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,810
that this packet has a source port and

26
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,000
the NAT is basically going to take that

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,590
source IP address and port and it's going to

28
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,860
translate it into a publicly reachable source IP

29
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,830
address and port, and the destination will remain

30
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,360
the same. That packet will make its way

31
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,540
to a global destination and the reply will make

32
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,190
its way to the globally reachable IP address on

33
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,880
the corresponding port. Now, when that packet with that

34
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,040
particular destination IP address and port reaches the NAT,

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,930
the NAT has a table that knows the mapping

36
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,620
between that public IP address and port and the

37
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,060
private one that it rewrote to generate the corresponding

38
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,008
public IP address and port. So we can

39
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:14,900
simply now rewrite the destination IP address of this

40
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,690
packet to the corresponding private address and port. NATs

41
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,060
are popular on broadband access networks, small or home

42
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,395
offices and VPNs. There's a clear savings in

43
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,230
IPv4 address space, since there can be many many

44
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,870
devices in one of these private networks and yet

45
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,170
all of the devices that are behind the NAT

46
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,010
only use up one public IP Address. The drawback,

47
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,040
of course, is that the end to end model is

48
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,810
broken. And we talked about the end to end

49
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,320
model in a previous lesson and let me just remind

50
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,215
you how NAT breaks it. If the NAT device

51
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:51,190
failed in this instance, for example, the mapping between the

52
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,470
private source IP address and port and the public source

53
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,420
IP address and port would be lost. Thereby breaking all

54
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,500
active connections for which the NAT is on

55
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,270
the path. It's also asymmetric. Under ordinary circumstances

56
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:10,730
it's rather difficult for a host on the global Internet to reach a device in a

57
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,060
private address space in network one or network

58
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,060
two, because by default those devices in these

59
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,290
private networks do not have public globally reachable

60
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,490
IP addresses. So, NAT both breaks end-to-end communication and

61
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,330
it also breaks by directional communication.
