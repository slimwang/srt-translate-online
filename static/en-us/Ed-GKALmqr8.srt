1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This has the correct behavior, but it's a really foolish way to compute the union of two s.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The reason for doing this is to show you the kind of things that can go wrong

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
if you just cut and paste code you find without understanding it.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're doing a lot more work than the original union would have been.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Of course, we could have done this as we have it and got the correct result

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
by replacing res here with just b.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Searching for code is a good starting point often,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but it's rarely a good ending point, and there's a lot of reasons not to do this.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The first is that you might be violating copyrights

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
or if you're taking code that is done under certain license.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, now, that license might impact the code that you're writing and the uses of it.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
These are things to be very careful about.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The other reason and the one that I am emphasizing today

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
is that you're really missing opportunity to learn something new.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
One of the best things about looking at other code is that you can learn from it.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And the final reason is that the code that you find might be broken

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
just because something is on the internet--you've probably learn this already--

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
not everything that you find on the internet is true and correct.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This does not mean that we shouldn't be searching for code

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and trying to find ways people have solved the problem that we want to solve.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But it does mean that we should be more careful with what we find

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
than just cutting and pasting it into our code.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's go back and look at the code that we found

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and there are several things in this code that we might not be familiar with

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
if all you've seen so far is CS101.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The most interesting one is set, and set is used twice

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
as well as this bar operator between two sets.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We might guess that well that's doing some sort of union operation

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
because if this does what it should, it is taking the union of two sets

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's figure out more about what set means

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Here's some choices. This is definitely a subjective question.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And I'll suggest that I think two of these are good answers.
