1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,660
OK, so here we have our data. And from cell A1, if we push Cmd down, or on a PC

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:14,103
I believe it's Ctrl down, then we see that there are 8,702 students. So first

3
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:22,762
let's calculate the average. So again, equals. Average, cell a1 colon a8,702,

4
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:31,130
enter. So we get that the engagement ratio is about 0.077, if we round to the

5
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:36,579
nearest thousandth. Okay, now that we have the mean, let's figure out the

6
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:41,488
standard deviation. And we don't use a correction when we're treating this a

7
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:51,372
population. So first let's find the square deviations from the mean. Equals a1

8
00:00:51,372 --> 00:01:01,117
minus $d$1. To keep this mean constant. Because otherwise if we just put D1 and

9
00:01:01,117 --> 00:01:07,984
then we copied this cell for all of column B then it would subtract D2 from A2,

10
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:14,222
and then D3 from A3, and there's nothing there. We want to always subtract D1

11
00:01:14,222 --> 00:01:21,059
and then we'll square this quantity. So there's are first square deviation.

12
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:33,625
We'll copy this, Cmd+C or Ctrl+C. We'll go to cell A8702, go to B8702, Cmd shift

13
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:42,140
up arrow key. All of column B is highlighted. Cmd+v. Now we have all our squared

14
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:48,176
deviations. Now let's take the average square deviation, which is the variance.

15
00:01:48,177 --> 00:02:01,999
Equals average B1 colon B8702. So here's what we get for variance. And now for

16
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:10,960
standard deviation we'll take the square root. Equals sqrt D2. So if we round

17
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,880
the standard deviation to the nearest thousandth, we get 0.107.
