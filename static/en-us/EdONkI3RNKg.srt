00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Thrun] So let's talk about probabilities.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Probabilities are the cornerstone of artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
They are used to express uncertainty,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and the management of uncertainty is really key to many, many things in AI

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
such as machine learning and Bayes network inference

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and filtering and robotics and computer vision and so on.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So I'm going to start with some very basic questions,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and we're going to work our way up from there.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Here is a coin.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The coin can come up heads or tails, and my question is the following:

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Suppose the probability for heads is 0.5.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What's the probability for it coming up tails?
