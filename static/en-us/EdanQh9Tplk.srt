We've encountered several situations in which the slope of a line was the

2
00:00:04,424 --> 00:00:08,991
coefficient of a term that an x to the first in our equation. But my question

3
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:13,729
is, does this hold true in all cases? For which of these equations down here do

4
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:18,194
you think that the slope of the line is the coefficient of the term with an x to

5
00:00:18,206 --> 00:00:22,166
the first in it? I know that you may not have an idea of what the graphs of each

6
00:00:22,178 --> 00:00:26,069
of these equations look like. But think about the form of the equations that

7
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:29,804
we've looked at so far, and which equations down here might have the same

8
00:00:29,816 --> 00:00:31,609
graphical properties as those ones.
