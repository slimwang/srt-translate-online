00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,950
One way we can actually fix this problem of the red circles and

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,710
not being able to know what they represent is by

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,170
a very simple addition of a legend to our chart.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:16,640
The legend is useful to associate a label to each of the circles here.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,850
Let's see what that looks like in D3.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,770
A very simple but powerful way to add context to your visualization or

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,800
graphic is through the simple use of text to add labels or annotations.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,300
I wanted to go through and show you how to add a legend using text.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,330
But this process can be extended to adding any sorts of labels or

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,240
annotation to any point on your graphic.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,390
What we have here is pretty standard.

12
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,770
And we've seen it before with all the circles.

13
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:51,900
Is we simply append to an SVG some group element, giving it a class of legend.

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:57,890
We simply move that group to be x position 100 less than the width, so

15
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:03,920
it's going to correspond to the width minus 100 and a y position of 20.

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,300
So again, y position of zero is the top of our chart.

17
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,560
So, this is going to be 20 pixels down from the top.

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,910
Again, this is one of the quarks with D3, so we've appended a group.

19
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,920
And then select that same group we've appended.

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:25,620
We bind data to it, in this case simply the strings home team and others.

21
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,660
And this is also to show you the flexibility, that your data doesn't have to

22
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,090
come from a file, doesn't have to have many rows in it.

23
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,820
In this case it's simply a JavaScript array with two strings in it.

24
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,570
Since we don't already have a legend on our page

25
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,660
the .enter selection is going to return two group elements.

26
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,240
One for the home team and one for the others.

27
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,020
Or rather placeholders.

28
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,280
And then for each of those placeholders bound to Home Team and

29
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,060
Others we append a group element.

30
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,870
And again if that seems confusing in words look back to what we

31
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,170
did with the circles.

32
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,140
Or run each of these functions in a web console to see

33
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,310
what values are passed in and out at every step of the chain.

34
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,180
So now we have a legend with SVG group elements bound to some data.

35
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,880
But we don't have text yet.
