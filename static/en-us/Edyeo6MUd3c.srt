00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,260
So finally, let's look at a little bit
more detail about these types of codes.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,292
So this was our all open shutter,
the sinc function looked like this.

3
00:00:08,292 --> 00:00:11,083
I captured both low and
high frequencies.

4
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:15,129
Of course, we can just alternate the
shutter, not in a random matter at all,

5
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:17,730
but just much more in
a time manner like this.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,980
A sinc function also still has low
frequencies and high frequencies,

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,860
it just has a different our, you know,
representation doesn't help us much.

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,252
Random, we can just run it randomly.

9
00:00:27,252 --> 00:00:30,867
It can, that would allow us to do this,
but again, would have more variations,

10
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:33,690
would have more peaks and
lows and stuff like that.

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,310
What these authors found is some sort
of a flutter starter signal like this,

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:42,020
which went through small, sharp, small,
large, small, large kinds of things.

13
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,324
Gave a sinc function like this that
captured all of the high frequencies,

14
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:48,456
and that was much more amenable to
the kind of stuff they wanted to do.

15
00:00:48,456 --> 00:00:50,490
Again, the analysis of this
exists in the paper, and

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,410
I encourage you to look at it.
