1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,540
F represents the frequency, so the number of people of each blood type, p

2
00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:09,281
represents the proportion of people with that frequency, and the percent is,

3
00:00:09,293 --> 00:00:14,047
well, the percentage. This little symbol here, you're going to get pretty used

4
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:18,662
to it. It's called sigma and it means the sum. So in total, you know that the

5
00:00:18,674 --> 00:00:23,260
sum here should be 35 and the proportions should all add to 1, just as the

6
00:00:23,272 --> 00:00:27,875
percentages should add to 100. Hopefully you calculcated these numbers in the

7
00:00:27,887 --> 00:00:31,660
last question. Now, let's answer some questions about this table.
