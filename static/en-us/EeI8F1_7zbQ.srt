1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,705
If we reject the null, that means we're accepting the alternative hypothesis,

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:09,826
which is that there is a significant difference. That means the sample

3
00:00:09,826 --> 00:00:13,794
statistic we get is very different than what we would expect for all the other

4
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:19,528
samples we could have gotten from that population. That means our sample mean

5
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:24,285
will fall within the critical region. If we just look at the positive

6
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:28,758
z-critical values, then our z-score should be greater than the z-critical

7
00:00:28,758 --> 00:00:33,998
value. This means that the sample mean will lie in the critical region. And

8
00:00:33,998 --> 00:00:38,534
finally, the probability of obtaining the sample mean will be less than the

9
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:44,200
alpha level. We set this alpha level as a guideline for the probability of

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,280
getting that sample statistic. And if the probability of getting that sample

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,506
statistic is low, that means there's something going on. And we have evidence

12
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:55,930
to reject the null.
