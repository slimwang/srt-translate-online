1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,950
So, as always, when I introduce a new concept to you, we'll have a little quiz about this here.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,480
Now, it's always a bit difficult to ask, does P go into an infinite loop

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,400
when given I, so we'll slightly change that to the opposite question here,

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,160
and ask, does the program stop when given I?

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,250
So it's basically the other way around, and also it's the more

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,130
conventional definition of the halting problem, because

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,260
it's called the halting problem and not the infinite loop problem, to just ask 'does the program stop?'

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,960
Basically it's really just the opposite of an infinite loop.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,160
So if a program stops, it does not go into an infinite loop,

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,390
and if it does not stop, it must be in some infinite loop.

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,660
But let's do the quiz now. So I have here 3 programs.

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,290
This is program 1, this is program 2, and program 3.

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,650
And, of course, I have inputs for those programs, and what I would like you to tell me

14
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,090
for each combination of a program and an input,

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,720
does the program stop when given this input?

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,730
It stops, then you can check here, if it does not stop, so if it goes into an infinite loop,

17
00:00:54,730 --> 99:59:59,999
then I would like you to check here.
