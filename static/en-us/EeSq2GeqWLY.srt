1
00:00:00,183 --> 00:00:04,615
So Travis, it appears in the My Favorite
Movies app, we'll need to use a sessions

2
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:07,903
ID in order to add and
remove movies from our Favorites List.

3
00:00:07,903 --> 00:00:10,421
Can you tell us a little
bit about how this is done?

4
00:00:10,421 --> 00:00:11,222
>> Yeah, sure.

5
00:00:11,222 --> 00:00:13,130
So basically, you know,

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,812
to get a lot of the account
features available on the API, so

7
00:00:17,812 --> 00:00:23,624
letting an account create a movie, add
them and remove them to your watch list,

8
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:28,880
create custom lists, etcetera you
need to get a TBB user account.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,990
So, once you have an account
on the website you're

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,533
able to go through a off flow
on the API that lets you [COUGH]

11
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:45,981
create a session that let' you do
these account features via the API.

12
00:00:45,981 --> 00:00:46,677
>> Cool.

13
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:49,045
Sounds like sessions
are definitely the place to start.

14
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:52,724
In this lesson, as we build My Favorite
movies, we're going to learn how to use

15
00:00:52,724 --> 00:00:56,185
the first of two off flows that the
movie database makes available to us.

16
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:58,543
Then in the next lesson,
we'll switch up the flow so

17
00:00:58,543 --> 00:01:00,210
you'll get exposure to both forms.
