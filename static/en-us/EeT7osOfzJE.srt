00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,642
So now I'm going to give you a touigh question. Which ironically is the same

2
00:00:04,642 --> 00:00:09,689
exact question I asked you before. But this time use the Z table to approximate

3
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:14,878
the proportion of people who have less than 240 Facebook friends. So this might

4
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:19,962
be tricky, but spend some time on it, and I think you can do it. And remember,

5
00:00:19,962 --> 00:00:24,799
whenever you are doing math, think about it logically. 240 is about here. So

6
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:29,783
should your z score be negative or positive? Should it be between zero and one,

7
00:00:29,783 --> 00:00:31,255
or between one and two?
