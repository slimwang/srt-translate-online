1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yes the answer is $120.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
By our logic, 1500 lies between 1400 and 1800.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In fact, it's a quarter away from 1400.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We'd say it's $112,000 plus 1/4 of the way from 1400 to 1800.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's a difference of the price of an 1800 square foot home and a 1400 square foot home,

6
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
adding a quarter of this gets us from $112,000 to just $120,000.
