1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,719
For guarded transitions, earlier we looked at situations where the response to

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:07,760
an event is conditioned on a sub-machine being in a state. For example,

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,190
with event 20 we had the response that looked like the following.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:17,600
If in mode music, go to speaker go in the speaker sub-machine to mode playing.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,650
This response can be coded as a transition between the silent state. And

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,110
the playing state for the speaker that occurs when event 20 happens.

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,850
And there is a guard that looks like the phrase in, in music.

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:36,380
And that particular logical expression is in square, square brackets.
