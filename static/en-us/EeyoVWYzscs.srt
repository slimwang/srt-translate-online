1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:07,534
we would get 11X plus 46 divided by the factors x plus 2 times x minus 6 times X

2
00:00:07,534 --> 00:00:12,975
plus 6. Fantastic work if you just added these numerators together. When we add

3
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:17,625
the numerators we just want to add the like terms, like 6X and 5X Which would

4
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:22,959
equal 11x. Likewise we would add the constant terms. Positive 36 and positive 10

5
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:28,163
equal positive 46. So here's our numerator and here's our denominator.
