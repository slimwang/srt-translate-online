00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,456
>> Okay, so clearly we haven't totally forgotten how to solve equations. That's

2
00:00:04,456 --> 00:00:08,760
awesome. It's going to help us a lot in algebra moving forward. Let's look at a

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,322
new equation. We have 3 over x minus 1 over 5 is equal to 7. Just like the last

4
00:00:13,322 --> 00:00:17,738
example, we have two fractions, but this time there's not an x anywhere in the

5
00:00:17,738 --> 00:00:21,740
second fraction. We have two choices as I see it, or at least two choices in

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,763
terms of how to start the problem. The first choice that I see is the first step

7
00:00:25,763 --> 00:00:29,667
we could take, would be to combine the two fractions that are on the left-hand

8
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:33,771
side. That's definitely an option. But there's another choice. We could isolate

9
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:37,187
the terms, or term in this case, involving x on the left-hand side and move

10
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:41,550
everything else over to the right-hand side. I have a feeling that it's going to

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,795
be a little bit less work if we go with the second option. I'll put a link to

12
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:50,005
how to do the problem in the other way in the lesson notes. But for now, let's

13
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:54,281
go with this method. So our goal right off the bat is to get this term by itself

14
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:58,466
on the left-hand side. So for the equation that I want you to write in this box,

15
00:00:58,466 --> 00:01:02,034
I would like you to isolate the term with x on the left-hand side. Get

16
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:05,934
everything else on the right-hand side and simplify it so that it's written as

17
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:08,142
an improper fraction. What do you get then?
