1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,840
For the first one we just have p to the 3 5ths, power divided by root or the

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,540
index. For the second one we'll have the quantity of 3, 2 to the 4th raised to

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,476
the 1, 6th. The power of this radican is really a 1, so we have our power of 1

4
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:19,692
divided by our index, our root, which is 6. For the third one we'll have the

5
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:23,695
quantity 5x squared raised to the 1 3rd power. We're taking the cubed root of

6
00:00:23,695 --> 00:00:27,412
this expression, and again we don't use the 2 as a power because the square is

7
00:00:27,412 --> 00:00:33,410
not the power of the 5 as well. It's only the power of the x. We have this

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,619
quantity raised to the 1, so there's our power and then the 3 or the cube for

9
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:42,699
our root. And for out last one we have 25 x squared raised to the one third

10
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:44,824
power. We have power divided by a root. You might have simplified this, which

11
00:00:44,824 --> 00:00:44,990
is great. We could have rewritten 25 x squared as the quantity 5x squared.

12
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:58,700
Then, since we're raising a power to a power we can multiply 2 times 1 3rd.

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,870
This would give us 5x raised to the 2 3rds, another acceptable answer. Great

14
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,473
work if you got at least two of those correct. I know these were pretty tricky.
