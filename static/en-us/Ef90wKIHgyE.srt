00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,970
Hey, awesome job.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,300
And now we can actually see
the translation of the words in our app.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,230
So let's take a step back for a moment,
and reflect on all that we've learned.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,520
So first, we covered how to use arrays.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,810
And then we switched over to
using lists, remember lists?

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,079
They were great.

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,480
And then we learned about loops.

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,010
Then we had to learn about view
recycling, using the list view and

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,200
the ArrayAdapter.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,730
But we ran into some limitations
with the ArrayAdapter, so

11
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,680
we created a custom ArrayAdapter to
display specifically word objects.

12
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,520
Now each of these skills can be used for
apps beyond your MeWalk app.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,630
And I encourage you to take time and

14
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,300
reflect on how you can use these
skills in your future projects.

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,980
Now I'd like you to sit back and
reflect on different places you

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,900
can apply the skills that
you've learned in this lesson.

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,300
So we covered topics such as arrays,
lists, loops,

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,150
view recycling, ListView and
ArrayAdapters, and custom ArrayAdapters.

19
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,810
So boy, there are a lot of topics.

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,210
And after you reflected on it,
go ahead and

21
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,490
share your thoughts on
the discussion forms.

22
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,985
And check out what other
students have said, too.
