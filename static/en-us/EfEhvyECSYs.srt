00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,235
In working out the answer to the last
quiz, we saw that when you're multiplying

2
00:00:04,331 --> 00:00:08,563
2 polynomials together, we actually end
up using the distributive property a

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:13,059
couple of times, multiplying every term
in the first expression by every term in

4
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:17,278
the second expression. So we're taking
every possible combination of pairs of

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,480
terms, using one from the first expression
and one from the second expression. This

6
00:00:21,492 --> 00:00:25,435
is actually a general rule that applies to
multiplying any pair of polynomials,

7
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:30,257
regardless of long it is. So we could use
this trick even if there were 10 terms

8
00:00:30,257 --> 00:00:33,160
inside the first set of parentheses and 3
terms inside the second set of

9
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:37,380
parentheses, or any other number of terms
in either one. In any situation like this

10
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:41,779
we just need to go through one by one,
each of the terms inside the first set of

11
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:47,213
parentheses, and multiply them by the
terms over here. So in this case, we start

12
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:52,074
with x, and we say x times the first term
over here, which is x, so we have x times x.

13
00:00:52,074 --> 00:00:56,112
And the second thing we do is multiply
x by the next term in the second set of

14
00:00:56,112 --> 00:01:00,660
parentheses, x times -2. Then, since we've
exhausted all the terms inside the second

15
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,010
set of parentheses, we can move to the
next factor inside the first set of

16
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,377
parentheses, which is 5. 5 applies to the
first term in the second set of

17
00:01:08,377 --> 00:01:13,619
parentheses, which is x, and then also to
the second term, which is -2. So stepping

18
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,764
one by one, through the terms inside the
first set of parentheses, and applying

19
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:22,093
them each to all of the terms inside the
second parentheses, before moving on to

20
00:01:22,093 --> 00:01:26,035
the next term, in the first set of
parentheses, is a great way to make sure

21
00:01:26,035 --> 00:01:29,799
that you have actually covered all of your
bases, and made all of the combinations of

22
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:31,643
pairs or terms that you can.
