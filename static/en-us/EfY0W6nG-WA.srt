>> That's a good answer, David. Note that David did several things in coming up

2
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,400
with his answer. First, he made sure that his answer covers all these signs and

3
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,210
symptoms. This is the principle of coverage. We want to make

4
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,660
sure that the diagnostic conclusion actually accounts for all the input data.

5
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,980
Second, we chose a single hypothesis over a combination of hypothesis, although

6
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,090
the combination could have explain this data as well. This is the principle of

7
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:10,030
parsimony. In general, we want a simple hypothesis for explaining the entire

8
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:15,300
data. Third, these hypotheses can have greatest interactions between them, and

9
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,950
these interactions can make your diagnostic task quite complicated.

10
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,121
Fourth, they would use the term explanation. This is an important aspect for

11
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:27,556
diagnosis. We want a set of hypotheses that could explain the input data.

12
00:01:27,556 --> 00:01:31,570
Now this [UNKNOWN] we did it in this simple exercise, because there is one

13
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:36,830
single disease that can, in fact, explain all the input data. What would

14
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,930
happen if there was no single hypothesis that could cover the entire input data?

15
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,790
Or what would happen if there were multiple hypotheses that could equally well

16
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,730
explain the input data? [UNKNOWN] diagnostic task can be quite complicated.
