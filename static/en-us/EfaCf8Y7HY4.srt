Here's part 2 for our math quill guide for unit 5. I mentioned learning about

2
00:00:04,412 --> 00:00:08,119
entering numbers is scientific notation. Let's see how we can do this. To enter

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,372
a number in scientific notation. You'll want to type in the leading number or

4
00:00:12,372 --> 00:00:16,329
decimal followed by the asterisk symbol. This asterisk symbol will create a dot

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,925
or a multiplication in between our first number and our power of 10. Be sure you

6
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:24,860
don't type x for the multiplication sign. We'll think it's a variable instead.

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,274
Next, you'll type in the number 10 followed by the carrot symbol and then the

8
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:33,594
exponent of 5. So now you try it out. You can follow these keystrokes to enter

9
00:00:33,594 --> 00:00:37,605
this number in scientific notation and then, try these on your own. Enter your

10
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:39,824
answers here and good luck.
