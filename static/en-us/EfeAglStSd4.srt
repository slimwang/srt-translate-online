1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,625
The two goals of congestion control are

2
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:07,530
fairness; meaning every send gets their fair share

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,410
of the network resources. And efficiency meaning

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,100
that the network resources are used well. In

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,920
other words we shouldn't have a case

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,360
where there are spare capacity or resources in

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,210
the network And senders have data to send, but are not able to send it.

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,570
So, we'd like the network to be used efficiently, but we'd also like it to be

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,710
shared among the senders. We can represent fairness

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,380
and efficiency in terms of a phase plot,

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,580
where each axis representers a particular user or particular senders.

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,320
Allocation. In this case we just have two users, one and two,

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,380
and we represent their allocations with x1 and x2. If the

14
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:56,078
capacity of the network is C, then we can represent the optimal operating line.

15
00:00:56,078 --> 00:01:02,950
As X1 + X2 being some constant, C. Anything to the left of this

16
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,440
diagonal line represents under utilization of the

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,130
network, and anything to the right of

18
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,790
the line represents overload. We can also

19
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:15,640
represent another line, X1 = X2 as some

20
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,450
notion of fair allocation. So the optimal point, is where the network is neither

21
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,730
under or over utilized, and when the allocation is fair. So being on

22
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,980
this diagonal line represents efficiency, and

23
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,440
being on the green diagonal line represents

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:40,800
fairness. We can use the phase plot to understand why senders who use additive

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,080
increase, multiplicative decrease, converge to fairness.

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,420
The senders also converge, to the efficient

27
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,750
operating point. Let's suppose that we start at the operating point shown in

28
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:58,090
blue. At this point both senders will additively increase their sending rates.

29
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:05,590
Additive increase results in moving along a line that is parallel to x1 and x2,

30
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:11,770
since both senders increase their rate by the same amount. Additive increase

31
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,160
will continue. Until the network becomes

32
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,920
overloaded. At this point the senders will

33
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,260
see a loss and perform multiplicative

34
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,620
decrease. In multiplicative decrease each sender decreases

35
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,990
its rate by some constant factor of its current sending rate. For example,

36
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,060
suppose each one of these senders decreases its

37
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,530
sending rate by half. The resulting operating point,

38
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,990
is shown by this second blue dot. Note

39
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,790
that that new operating point, as a result

40
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,730
of multiplicative decrease, is on a line between

41
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,630
the point on the efficiency line, that the

42
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,790
centers hit, and the origin. At this point

43
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,430
the sender's will again increase their sending rate

44
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:03,080
along a line that's parallel to X1 equals X2 until they hit over load again.

45
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,290
At which point they will again retreat towards the origin. You can see that

46
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,480
eventually, the senders will reach this optimal

47
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,860
operating point through the path. That's delineated by

48
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,580
the blue line. To think about this a bit more you can see that every

49
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,480
time additive increase is applied, that increases efficiency.

50
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,500
Every time multiplicative decrease is applied that improves

51
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,450
fairness because every time. We apply multiplicative decrease,

52
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,250
we get closer to this x1 equals x2 line.
