1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The next kind of testing is system testing, and here we're asking a different question

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
than we were asking with integration testing and unit testing.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here we're asking the question does the system as a whole meet its goals?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And often at this point we're doing black box testing, and that's for a couple of reasons.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
First of all, the system is probably large enough by now

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
that a detailed knowledge of its internals may not be

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
very much help in creating good test cases.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The second reason is really at this point we're not so much concerned

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
with what's going on inside the system as with

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
whether the system actually meets its goals or not,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and so another thing that differentiates system testing from unit testing

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
is the fact that at this level we are often concerned with how the system will be used.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And the fact is, at this level we may not care about

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
making the system work for all possible use cases.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Rather, we would simply like to make sure that it performs

16
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
acceptably for the important use cases.
