1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,360
At this point, you've done
a lot with individual inputs.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,720
You should be proud.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,570
>> Right, you've tried out
different input types and

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,890
you know how to pick the right one for
the right situation.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,840
>> You've attached useful labels
to your inputs ensuring that users

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,950
always know what they are typing
while they are typing.

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,500
>> You've used the autocomplete
attribute to help the browser

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,850
autofill common input fields.

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,530
>> You've used different validation
attributes to validate users' input,

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,690
even before they submit your forms.

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,479
>> And you've played with
the constraints validation API, for

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,260
those times when you need to
validate more complex inputs.

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,590
>> In the next lesson, Ken and
I will help you to take a step

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,470
back from looking at single inputs
to looking at the forms as a whole.

15
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,470
>> Right.

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,020
Let's get started.
