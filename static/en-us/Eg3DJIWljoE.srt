00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,270
So you might ask, how did I get this list of

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,030
files that I used to my manifest? I could just list

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,150
every file coming from a directory listing from my server. But

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,400
I don't want to grab things like Python files. So, the easiest

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,670
thing to do is to get files that you know you're

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,700
going to need, like the images I knew were referenced. And

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,330
the JavaScript files. And then walk through one at a time

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,630
and see what happens when you try to run the app

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,290
from the cache. Let's try this now. Let's take

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,240
a couple of these files out and see what happens.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,010
Let's save the manifest file, and go back and

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,750
reload. Now remember, even though we downloaded a new cache

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,540
here, what we're looking at over here is not

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,230
that uploaded content. We need to refresh one more time.

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,430
And now you'll notice that when I try to

16
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,680
get this file from my application, it just fails. Now,

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,200
if I had put in my manifest file under the

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,630
network section, star, that would mean anything could come from

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,500
the network. I find it's a useful trick to not

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,450
use network Star because then you can see what's failing.
