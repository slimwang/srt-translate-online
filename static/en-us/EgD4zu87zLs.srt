1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,366
Here's the answer.

2
00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:08,425
We'll start with the polynomial a and
for this I get the values 2, 5, 2, 5.

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:11,140
You could have done
the calculation however you liked.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,880
To emphasize that we can view this
process as matrix multiplication,

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,560
I've written out
the Vandermonde Matrix here.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,527
For b, we just change the coefficients.

7
00:00:20,527 --> 00:00:27,389
And we get 3, 5, -1, -3 for
the values of the polynomial.

8
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:30,070
Multiplying in the value
domain is simple.

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:35,930
We just multiply the corresponding
values at these inputs,

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,104
and that gives me 6, 25, -2, and -15.

11
00:00:39,104 --> 00:00:43,977
This gives me a matrix equation
here in terms of the desire

12
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:48,241
to coefficients of
the product polynomial C, and

13
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:53,950
solving this gives me the answer
1 + 2x + x squared + 2x cubed.

14
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,380
Which, you can easily verify is correct

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,160
by convolving those two sets of
coefficients in the normal way.
