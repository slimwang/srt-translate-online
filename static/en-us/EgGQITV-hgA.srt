1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,310
The first one, known-Plaintext attacks.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,390
The answer is d.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:11,540
In this attack, a specific known
plaintext is compared to its ciphertext.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,380
Second, chosen-Plaintext attacks.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,290
The answer is c.

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,190
In this attack method, the attacker
can choose randomly some plaintext and

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,900
obtain the corresponding ciphertext.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,552
Third, differential cryptanalysis.

9
00:00:26,552 --> 00:00:29,050
The answer is b.

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,270
In this attack, the attacker
controls a changes of the input,

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,660
meaning the input plaintext.

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,940
And then observe the changes of the
output, meaning the output ciphertext.

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,180
Four, linear cryptanalysis.

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,530
The answer is a.

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:49,032
In this attack method, the attacker
models the relationship between

16
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:54,070
plaintext, ciphertext, and
the key, using linear equations.

17
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:59,550
And then he uses the known ciphertext,
plaintext pair to derive the key bits.
