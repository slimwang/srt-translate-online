1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,760
So we just got some feedback
from Jeremy about our app.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,630
One of the things I wanted you to note
about this is that he didn't have

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,848
trouble with some of the things that we
had trouble with in the first iteration

4
00:00:08,848 --> 00:00:09,662
of user feedback.

5
00:00:09,662 --> 00:00:11,474
He had no trouble
finding the check boxes.

6
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:14,900
There wasn't any confusion
around task versus event.

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,390
And he seemed able to navigate
around the app pretty well.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,800
However, there were a couple of things
that we noticed were a little bit wrong

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,860
with the app still.

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,990
Jeremy wanted to actually
input his data into the app.

11
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,110
And Jeremy noticed there were
a lot of extra things in the app,

12
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:35,060
that maybe weren't tied to the core
aspects that I was asking him about.

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,350
These are things that we'll
look into in the future and

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,670
as we continue to iterate
are things that you would solve.
