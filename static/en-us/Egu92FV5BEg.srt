1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,564
What we want to do now, is take into
account, these two updates to Grant's

2
00:00:04,577 --> 00:00:09,312
total future earnings. We know that the
first thing that happens, is that Mr.

3
00:00:09,418 --> 00:00:14,310
Belvedere will triple the orders that
Grant had initially. And then after that

4
00:00:14,322 --> 00:00:19,195
tripling happens, a school orders one
wiper set and two nozzles for each of its

5
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:24,406
150 students. So remember step one here
happens before step two. So taking those

6
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:29,005
two things into account what is a new
equation for Grant's future earnings? So,

7
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:33,679
in other words, how do we modify the
equation that we had before for his total

8
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:38,799
future earnings, 84w+60n, to reflect these
two changes to the number of orders that

9
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:43,803
he has, and therefore the amount of money
that he's going to make? Please choose the

10
00:00:43,815 --> 00:00:45,446
best choice from these four.
