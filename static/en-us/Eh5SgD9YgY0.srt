1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
So, I think our four computer scientist can be rather optimistic

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,230
and that is also why they are all smiling a little bit here.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,190
So, now, it's time to say goodbye to Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,310
and wish them all the best for their jobs

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,750
because in the next unit we are going to take a look at problems that are far worse

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,510
that anything you have encountered so far.

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,310
In the final unit of this course, we are going to look at problems

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:28,860
that are worse than NP complete problems, worse than games such as road block,

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,300
and worse than exponential time complete.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,560
We are going to explore the very limits of computation

11
00:00:33,560 --> 99:59:59,999
and look at problems that no computer can solve ever, so see you next time.
