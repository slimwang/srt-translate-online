1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,048
For the first inequality, I can add 4 to both sides to get negative 3x is

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:08,580
greater than 9. Then we divide by negative 3, the coefficient of x, we get x is

3
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:13,204
less than negative 3. Remember, we need to reverse the inequality sign here. For

4
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:17,734
the second inequality, we add 1 to both sides, then we divide by 5 to get x is

5
00:00:17,746 --> 00:00:22,229
less than or equal to negative 4. Notice I don't need to reverse the inequality

6
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:26,699
sign here because I divided by a positive. We only reverse the inequality sign

7
00:00:26,711 --> 00:00:30,942
when we multiply or divide by a negative. We can graph these solutions on a

8
00:00:30,954 --> 00:00:35,323
number line. x can be any value less than negative 3 here or x can be any value

9
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:39,809
less than or equal to negative 4 here. But remember, we want x values for either

10
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:44,380
this inequality or this inequality. Let's see these number lines stacked on top

11
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:45,702
of each other to decide.
