1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,600
The mostly fluid pattern,

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,400
is very similar to column drop, but
it tends to be a bit more grid like.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,780
With more columns and

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,480
columns fitting in different ways,
depending on the viewport width.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,720
Just like column drop at its narrowest
viewport, the layout is stacked but

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,300
as the layout gets wider,
the grid pattern starts to appear.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,000
And eventually, once the layout
hits its widest viewport,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,990
margins are added on the left and
right, instead of expanding things out.

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,400
I've made this one a bit more complexed,
with a few additional divs.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,660
Just like column drop,
I'm using flexbox and

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,660
setting the width of each element to
100% at their narrowest viewport.

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,635
At the first breakpoint, I'll make
the light blue div and the green div,

13
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:46,420
50% width.

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,224
Just like before,
I'll add a min-width query, to check for

15
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:52,700
a min-width of 450 pixels.

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,220
If that's the case, I'll make
the light blue and green 50% width.

17
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,070
I want another breakpoint at 550 pixels.

18
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll add the media query, and

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,400
set the appropriate widths
on the right elements.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,010
And finally another breakpoint
that adds margins to the side,

21
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,560
when the viewport is beyond 700 pixels.

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,650
Let's take a look at it in the browser.

23
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,120
Everything is stacked as I
expect at below 450 pixels.

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,510
And as I expand up,
I get a switch at 450.

25
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,980
I'll get a switch again at 550 pixels.

26
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,400
And above 700 pixels, I'll start
getting margins added to the side.

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,650
That's exactly what I wanted.
