1
00:00:00,244 --> 00:00:02,693
Suppose, you look at the date and time you were

2
00:00:02,693 --> 00:00:06,626
born, and then specifically look not at the date

3
00:00:06,626 --> 00:00:10,291
, not even the time, but just the seconds of the

4
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:13,199
time. So, it could be that we were born exactly

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:15,815
as the minute began, in which case, it was zero

6
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:20,593
; or exactly at second 59.282, I don’t know.

7
00:00:20,593 --> 00:00:22,353
Let’s assume it’s completely uniform. There

8
00:00:22,353 --> 00:00:25,035
is no preference to be born early in the

9
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:26,968
minute or late in the minute. I’m going to

10
00:00:26,968 --> 00:00:29,692
ask you two questions now. For any such

11
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:34,136
thing, X, where X is the seconds of the timestamp

12
00:00:34,136 --> 00:00:37,294
, what’s the probability of that specific X

13
00:00:37,294 --> 00:00:40,389
? And, what’s the density of that specific X?

14
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:43,110
It might mean that these are actually different questions.
