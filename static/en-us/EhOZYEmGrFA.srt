1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this unit, we look at models with flows between different compartments.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The obvious use was in epidemiology where we had susceptible persons

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
who became ill and eventually recovered, but what about economy.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Money may flow from one account to the other or goods may flow from one country to the other.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In chemistry, you may have several types of molecules

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that combined to form other types of molecules.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In biology, the members of a species are born young, become adolescent, and then mature.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In the next unit, we are going to look at examples from biology, in particular, to study equilibria

9
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that is situations in which one falls is exactly balance by another falls.
