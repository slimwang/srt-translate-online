1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,961
So this quiz is about how common
are these vulnerabilities, or

2
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:07,963
how many vulnerabilities are known.

3
00:00:07,963 --> 00:00:11,010
So remember that vulnerabilities
we don't know about.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,020
Okay we come to know about them
only after we are exploited.

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,370
And those are called
zero day vulnerabilities.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,260
We had no time to fix them or
patch them before they got exploited.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,955
But known vulnerabilities,

8
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:27,557
you patch your systems to make
them go away in things like that.

9
00:00:27,557 --> 00:00:31,700
So we're talking about what systems
actually have known vulnerabilities.

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:37,653
So the data about this is maintain this
National Vulnerability Database or

11
00:00:37,653 --> 00:00:42,195
NVD, so you will need to access
that to answer this quiz.

12
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:46,696
And it has lot of Information about
vulnerabilities that are numbered

13
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:50,814
through what is called CVEs and
it tells you what system nature of

14
00:00:50,814 --> 00:00:54,620
the vulnerability what can happen and
things like that.

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,750
But here rather than go into those kind
of details we're just talking about

16
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,400
how many of these are there.

17
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,120
So take a few minutes to think about
these questions and take answers and

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,940
then we'll come back and
discuss what the correct answers are.
