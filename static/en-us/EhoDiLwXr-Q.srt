00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,770
Try multiplying this one out. We have the binomial of 3 root 3 plus 5 squared.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,560
Think about what the square really means, and then see if you can figure out

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:15,530
the answer. As a caution, you can't distribute a square over a sum. We know

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,958
that's not true. Again, think back to polynomials, and you might be able to

5
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:22,435
figure it out. Try your best.
