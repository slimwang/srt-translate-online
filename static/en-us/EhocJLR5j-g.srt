Knowledge based is a dominate field with a very active research program. There

2
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:11,200
are number of exiting projects going on right now. Here is a small list of them.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,390
CALO is a project, in which cognitive assistant learns and organizes knowledge.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:21,250
CALO, in fact was a pick cursor for the CD program of Apple. Cyc and OMCS.

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,690
OMCS stands for Open Mind Common Sense. Cyc and OMCS are two large knowledge

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:32,119
bases to support everyday common sense of reasoning. Wolfram Alpha is a new kind

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,430
of search engine that uses some of the same kind of pilot structures we have

8
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,460
considered in this particular class, different from many of the search engines.

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,930
The three projects in the right column are projects here at Georgia Tech. VITA

10
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,270
is a computational model of visual thinking in autism. And particular it solves

11
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,250
problems in the real world raven's progressive matrices test using only visual

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,680
spacial representations. Dramatis is a computational model suspense in drama and

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,260
stories. Recall that in this class we talked about the theory of humor and

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,890
surprise. Dramatis tries to do the same thing for suspense. DANE is a system for

15
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,710
supporting design based on analogies to natural systems. We've come across this

16
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,720
idea of biologically inspired design earlier in the class and DANE supports that

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,210
kind of biologically inspired design. We have provided references for

18
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,070
these and many other knowledge based AI projects in the class notes.

19
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,360
Your welcome to explore depending on your inquests.
