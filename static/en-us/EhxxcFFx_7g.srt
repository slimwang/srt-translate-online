00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,250
Finally, and this is the half bit that I was telling you about,

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:08,380
there's an alternative way of doing calibration, which is pretty cool.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,030
And in fact, it's really what everybody is using today,

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,550
because typically you don't have all these points.

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,770
And it's a way of getting the intrinsics, and

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,930
then if you know where you put these checker boards it's extrinsics.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,460
Basically what you do is you take a checker board and you move it around.

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,240
And you can end up calibrating the camera, with respect to that checkerboard.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,094
The reason everybody uses that, these days, is that there's.

10
00:00:34,094 --> 00:00:37,174
First of all, you can print out a checkerboard and it the checkerboard has to be

11
00:00:37,174 --> 00:00:39,423
on a plane, well that's easy you print out a checkerboard.

12
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:41,826
You gotta make sure your printer doesn't screw things up,

13
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:44,770
you gotta make sure that it actually comes out that squares are squares.

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:50,060
You mount it on something that's a nice piece of rigid cardboard or foam core.

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,482
And you don't have to know the positions and

16
00:00:52,482 --> 00:00:56,100
orientations in order to get the intrinsics of the camera.

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,430
And later you can get the intrinsics as well.

18
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,200
And why does everybody use this?

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,970
Because the code is easily available online.

20
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,670
OpenCV supports this directly.

21
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,420
We list here a MATLAB version of it.

22
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,500
If you go to Zhengyou Zhang's web site, he's like doctor calibration.

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,520
He did spectacular work for us, thesis etc, in calibration.

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,900
I'll also tell you that there's something cool you can do, and

25
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,530
in fact, the a student of mine, Kelsey Hawkins did this.

26
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,460
And I, I think the code is made publicly available.

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,900
If you take a checkerboard and you mount it on the end of a robot arm.

28
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,470
And remember, a robot knows where its arm is in terms of its coordinate system.

29
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,067
If you also know let's say the offset of that checkerboard from the the end

30
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:36,750
effector, the hand.

31
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,960
Then what you can do is with a camera you can just move that

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,700
checkerboard around using the robot, and of course we know the 3D

33
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,010
location of the checkerboard at every point in time that we take an image.

34
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,720
And so, by taking those images of the checkerboard,

35
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,200
you end up calibrating the camera to the robot's coordinate system.

36
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,200
So, it's a cool use of doing this directly within robotics.
