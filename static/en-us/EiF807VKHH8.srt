1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:00,840
All right.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,200
Let's see where we are.

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,490
If you were able to get the preview
view controller delegate set up.

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,840
Your app probably looks
something like this.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,000
I open up the app to
an empty collection.

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,820
I'm able to see my GIFs in a collection.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,970
But when I close out of
the app completely, and

8
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,390
then I relaunch, my GIFs are gone.

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,910
So we can check off Save a GIF, and

10
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,280
we can check off View saved
GIFs in a collection.

11
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,700
Now, I know we still need to
set up our detail view but so

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,250
we don't have to generate test GIFs
every time we relaunch the app,

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,170
let's go ahead and
persist the GIFs first.

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:36,990
In order to do that,

15
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,460
we'll need to be sure that the GIF class
conforms to the NSCoding protocol.

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,050
We'll need to save the GIFs
to the documents directory

17
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,320
using the NSKeyedArchiver method,
archiveRootObject.

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,167
I will need to retrieve those saved
GIFs using the NSKeyedUnarchiver method,

19
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:53,681
unarchiveRootObject.
