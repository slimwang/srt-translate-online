1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,027
Since we know how much money we're starting with the beginning of year 2. We

2
00:00:04,027 --> 00:00:08,597
need to figure out the interest that amount is going to earn. Since your

3
00:00:08,597 --> 00:00:15,496
interest rate is 3%, we need to multiply 10,300 by 0.03. Since this is how we

4
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:25,580
convert three percent into a decimal. 10,300 times 0.03 is just 309. And this

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:33,216
added to our original balance gives grant 10,609 at the end of year 2. We know

6
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:37,888
that this is the amount that he starts with at the beginning of year 3. So we

7
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:47,868
can write that in here as well. Now, 10,609 times 0.03 gives us $318.27. Adding

8
00:00:47,868 --> 00:00:58,874
these together, Grant has a total of $10,927.27, by the end of the third year.
