1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,244
So to make this a little
bit more formal,

2
00:00:02,244 --> 00:00:04,542
we're going to specify sort
of all the elements in HMM.

3
00:00:04,542 --> 00:00:05,670
You've already sort of seen them.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,360
N is going to be the number of states,
so S1 through SN is our set of states.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,588
So that's like sunny, rainy, snowy.

6
00:00:14,588 --> 00:00:18,625
And then there is a notion of
a state sequence written as Q.

7
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:25,230
And the idea is that Q sub i is
whatever state I'm at at time i, okay?

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,365
So when I say Q sub 3 equals S2,

9
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:33,850
what that means is at time step 3,
I'm in the second state, all right?

10
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,042
Given the state I can talk about
the full specification of an HMM.

11
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:41,080
And for whatever reason,
HMMs are referred to as lambda.

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,340
It's a triplet made up of three
components that you've all ready seen.

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,220
There's a state transition matrix, those
are the A's, the probability of going

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,910
from one state at one time,
given that you were at another state.

15
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,890
There's the observation matrix,
which before,

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,890
I was showing you as a discreet, and
was actually represented as a matrix.

17
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,629
There's also a continuous
version where your output is

18
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,630
you have a distribution over some
future vector for each state.

19
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,120
So maybe it's you know, you're out
putting a, some sort of a measurement.

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,100
And what you say is I've got one
Gaussian in state 1, and a different

21
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,280
Gaussian in state 2, and a different,
different Gaussian in state 3.

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,264
The idea is that for any given output,

23
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:25,172
you can talk about the likelihood or
the probability of given that output,

24
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:27,417
given that you were in
a particular state.

25
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:31,250
And then the last thing you need is
that initial distribution pi, right?

26
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,061
because it says, what's
the probability of starting at each,

27
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,110
in a particular state?
