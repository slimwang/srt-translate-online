1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,691
So the last equation that we'd created for
Grant to tell him how much he would earn

2
00:00:04,691 --> 00:00:08,516
in the future, once people actually paid
for the glasses, wipers, and nozzles they

3
00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:15,359
had ordered, was that his total future
earnings = 84w, where w is the price per

4
00:00:15,371 --> 00:00:20,257
wiper set plus 60n, where n is the price per
nozzle. However, there's been another

5
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:24,501
change in the situation. In considering
the last change that happened to Grant,

6
00:00:24,597 --> 00:00:28,146
which was the cancellation of orders that
made him really, really sad, this is a

7
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:33,291
super positive update. First, Grant got a
telephone call from an elderly wealthy

8
00:00:33,303 --> 00:00:37,187
gentleman, named Mr. Belvedere, who
happens to be super interested in glasses

9
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:41,433
wipers and in the nozzles that Grant has
developed to go along with his wiper

10
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:45,092
blades. He was so enthusiastic about
Grant's inventions that he offered to

11
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:48,813
triple all of the orders that Grant had
brought in so far, which means that

12
00:00:48,813 --> 00:00:54,245
Grant's total future earnings, which we
know before were 84w + 60n, will be

13
00:00:54,257 --> 00:00:58,690
multiplied by 3. Then a second piece of
good news came. A school principal called

14
00:00:58,702 --> 00:01:04,038
Grant and let him know that she wanted to
order, one wiper blade set and one pair of

15
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:10,068
nozzles, for each of her 150 students who
wear glasses. This however happened after

16
00:01:10,068 --> 00:01:14,410
Mr. Belvedere decided to triple the orders
that had come in so far. So his tripling

17
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:17,790
does not apply to this new batch orders
from the school.
