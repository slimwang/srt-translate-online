1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,830
So we've been talking about all these
different ways to monetize your app

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,960
from premium to freemium options.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,170
But sometimes it can be difficult
to decide on a strategy.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,882
Wouldn't it be nice to get paid just
based on how much people liked your

5
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:12,479
game?

6
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,820
>> Yep, and Amazon has actually
created a monetization model

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,500
that tries to do just this.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,069
It's called Amazon Underground.

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,280
>> Cool, tell me more about it.

10
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,480
How can a game make
money off of likability?

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,250
>> Well,
it's hard to measure likability.

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,340
But we can get an idea of that based
on how often a game is played.

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,800
So Amazon Underground
pays game developers

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,980
based on how much time
players spend in their game.

15
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,480
>> That sounds pretty interesting.

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,990
So every player would help
to monetize their game.

17
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,890
>> Exactly.

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,410
Amazon Underground has a great
selection of premium apps and games for

19
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,900
free and
all in-app purchases are free, too.

20
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,190
For example, you mentioned
playing Fruit Ninja before.

21
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,420
And in the Underground version,
you can get all the stars and

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,380
golden apples you want for free.

23
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,150
They are still packaged in a store,
like in the original game fomat.

24
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,380
But their price is zero.

25
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,000
>> So
no other monetization models are used.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,570
That sounds really easy.

27
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,930
But how much money can a developer
expect to make off of this model?

28
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,655
>> Well, Underground has a per minute
payment rate which translates to

29
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:16,320
12 cents an hour.

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,690
This can add up,
especially if you have a lot of players.

31
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,090
>> What an interesting way to monetize.

32
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,850
This is something to keep in mind
when you're designing your game.

33
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,960
Different platforms may have
built-in monetization strategies.
