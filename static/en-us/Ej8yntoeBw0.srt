00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,195
Now we need to find what s is? And in this case we're finding the standard

2
00:00:04,195 --> 00:00:08,852
deviation of each difference. So bring up your spread sheet and in this column

3
00:00:08,852 --> 00:00:13,621
calculate the difference. And then find the standard deviation using the

4
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:17,853
denominator n minus 1. And then write what you get for s.
