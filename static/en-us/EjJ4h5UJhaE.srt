1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,621
The answer is 2. If we look at this equation and we require that a can't be 0,

2
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:09,206
then we'll always have a term with an x to the 2nd power in it. And this will

3
00:00:09,206 --> 00:00:13,640
always be the term with the highest degree. So that means that quadratic

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,848
equations have this degree as well.
