Now for an exercise on basic solutions.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,740
Given the equations below,
find a basic solution for X.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,130
Remember that since there
are only two rows in your matrix,

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,910
your solution must not have
more than two non-zero entries.
