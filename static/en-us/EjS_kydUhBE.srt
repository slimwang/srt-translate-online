1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,818
Our final answer is negative 19 plus the square root of 77. Nice work if you

2
00:00:05,818 --> 00:00:09,734
found this answer. Now this one was tough because we will end up distributing a

3
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:14,960
square root of negative 11 in our problem. Let's see how it's done. First we

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,804
distribute the square root of 7 to 2 root 7 and to 3 root 11. Next we

5
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:25,403
distribute the negative square root of 11 to 2 root 7 and to 3 root 11... I

6
00:00:25,403 --> 00:00:28,636
write all these out so that way you don't confuse multiplying numbers and

7
00:00:28,636 --> 00:00:33,552
multiplying radicals. Like for this first term, I have 1 times 2 which equals

8
00:00:33,552 --> 00:00:39,272
2, and root 7 times root 7 which is just 7. For the second term, I'll have 3

9
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:44,710
times the square root of 77. For a third term, we'll have negative 2 times the

10
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:50,329
square root of 77. And finally for our 4th term we'll have negative 3 times 11.

11
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:56,812
The square root of 11 times the square root of 11 is just 11. We combine these

12
00:00:56,812 --> 00:01:02,268
two terms since they both have the square root of 77. 3 root 77 minus 2 root 77

13
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:08,738
is 1 root 77. We carry out the multiplication and then we'll have 14 minus 33,

14
00:01:08,738 --> 00:01:14,173
which equals negative 19. We bring down our root to get our final answer.
