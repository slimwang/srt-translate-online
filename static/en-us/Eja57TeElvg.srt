1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the real world, it's entirely possible that language influences thought,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and it may be that some things are easier in 1 language than another.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In the world of computing, the languages that we are considering,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
like Python and JavaScript, are ultimately equally expressive in a strong formal sense.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
However, we often still think that some things are easier--

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
that is, maybe they take you a little less time to write or they're a little easier to read,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
they feel a little more natural--in 1 language than another.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You may just prefer writing code in Python to writing code in JavaScript

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
even though ultimately you could say all of the same things in JavaScript.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
One may feel a little easier to you even though the end results would be the same.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So I assert that interpreting or translating between 2 systems of meaning

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
is actually a very deep concept.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And 1 interesting downside for us is that simulating a program,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
interpreting it, translating it often requires running it.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let's see how that plays out.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Here I've written a simple Python program,

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the sort that we might want to translate or interpret into JavaScript and then back again,

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and what I'd like to know is, what does it do? Maybe it prints 0.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I've listed a few options.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want you to think about this program in your head

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and tell me, what will happen if I run it?

22
00:01:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that apply, bearing in mind that I am trying to trip you up.
