1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,910
A is true, but not relevant here.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,150
Yes, they're mathematically equivalent, but I just say,

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,710
why would you prefer one or the other?

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,770
Well, both B and C are reasons why you might, right?

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,560
They're just basically filters you have around.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,170
I want the gradient and the x direction.

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,100
Here's my filter, I'll just apply it.

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,290
And it, it just makes it a easier way, to do that computation.

9
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,170
You know, going forward,

10
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,490
you may decide that you've got different smooth images already, and

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,610
you're just going to take the gradient, so you just do that directly.

12
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,300
Fine, you know,

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,370
be contrary, that's okay, because A is true, they are mathematically equivalent.
