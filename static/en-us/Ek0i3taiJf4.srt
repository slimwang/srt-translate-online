1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,660
Now it's time to set up the routing for
application.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,900
In the mock-ups, we specify routes for
the following pages.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,550
Note that landing on the root page
of our site will now route us to

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,630
the page that shows all
of the restaurants.

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:15,640
And, visiting /restaurant/menu ID will
automatically take us to the menu page.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,165
Create a new Python file called,

7
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:20,410
finalproject.py in the same
directory as all of our other files.

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,400
Import the Flask module and the app.run
code, like in the previous lesson.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,360
Add the routing for
all pages into finalproject.py and

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,960
create the following methods that return
the appropriate messages in the browser.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,590
When you save and

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,470
fire up your browser, you should be
able to visit all of the URLs like so.

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,830
At the end of this iteration,

14
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,160
you have shown that you can
get a Flask application up and

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,080
running, accounting for all
the necessary pages your app will have.
