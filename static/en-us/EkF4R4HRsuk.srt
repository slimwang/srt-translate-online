00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,200
So our answer to the last quiz would've been a lot easier

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,900
to read and a lot more useful if we used names to

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,290
keep track of values, instead of writing out those big numbers, especially

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,650
numbers as big as the speed of light. Python provides a way

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,530
to do it. It's called the Variable. We can use the variable

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,650
to create a name and use that name to refer to a

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,620
variable. So the way to introduce a variable is using an assignment

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,680
statement. And an assignment statement looks like this. We have a name,

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,860
followed by an equal symbol, followed by an expression. After

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,660
the assignment statement, the name that was on the left side

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,190
refers to the value that the expression has. The name

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,470
can be any sequence of letters and numbers, as well as

13
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,850
underscores, as long as it starts with a letter or

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,785
an underscore. So here's an example, we could create the name,

15
00:00:44,785 --> 00:00:47,970
speed_of_light, and we can assign to it the value of the

16
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,078
speed of light in meters per second. So after that assignment,

17
00:00:51,078 --> 00:00:55,810
the name speed_of_light refers to that value. One way to

18
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,320
think of that is to have an arrow, so we can

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,130
have the name speed_of_light, and that's a name which refers to

20
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,180
a value. And the value it refers to is this long

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,190
value, which is the speed of light in meters per

22
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,040
second. So once we've done the assignment, we can use the

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,720
name and the value of the name is the value that

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,290
it refers to. In this case it's the speed of light

25
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,365
in meters per second. So let's try that in the Python interpreter.

26
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:26,447
So here we've introduced the variable speed of light and we've assigned to it

27
00:01:26,447 --> 00:01:31,537
the value 299,792,458, the speed of light in meters per second.

28
00:01:31,537 --> 00:01:34,080
And now we've got that, assign it a variable.

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,880
Instead of having to type out that whole number, we

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,850
can use it directly. When we print out the

31
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,290
speed of light, it will be the value that that

32
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,720
name refers to. So we'll see, instead of seeing

33
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,240
speed of light, we'll see the 299 million value here.

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,220
We can use in expressions as well. So if we

35
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,510
want to convert it into centimeters instead of meters, we

36
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,870
can multiply by 100 and now we see the result

37
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,900
is the speed of light in centimeters per second. So

38
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,950
let's define another variable. This one will define billionth, which

39
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,420
means 1 divided by 1,000,000,000. That's hard enough to remember

40
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,980
how many zeros to type, so it's nice to

41
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,270
have that in a variable. And now we can define

42
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,700
nanostick, which is the length of Grace Hopper's nanostick,

43
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,020
as the speed of light times a billionth. That would

44
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,130
be the length of the nanostick in meters. If

45
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,260
we want it in centimeters, we can multiply by 100.

46
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,350
And so now we've defined a variable, nanostick, which is

47
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,210
the length light travels in a nanosecond, in centimeters, and

48
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,560
we can print that out. So, variables are really useful. They're going to

49
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,180
make our programs a lot easier to understand. They also mean that we can

50
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,590
use the same expression, changing the

51
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,330
values of the variables to compute different

52
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,810
things. So, now it's time for a quiz to see if you understand variables.
