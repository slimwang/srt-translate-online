00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,719
Let's take a break from our project for
a bit and talk about a very specific,

2
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:07,151
but useful feature of
the Google Maps APIs.

3
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:11,934
>> Here at Google, we have offices all
over the world, from New York to London,

4
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:14,006
to India, to China, to Sidney.

5
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:17,786
Just yesterday, I scheduled
a meeting with my teammate in Japan.

6
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:20,344
>> What if you wanted
a quick way to find out what

7
00:00:20,344 --> 00:00:22,911
time zone you're in
based on the location?

8
00:00:22,911 --> 00:00:24,782
>> That would be really useful.

9
00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:29,399
Luckily, the Google Maps APIs
includes a Time Zone API web service.

10
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,067
This feature is pretty simple,

11
00:00:31,068 --> 00:00:34,768
you can pass in a location in the form
of a lat-long and a day time stamp,

12
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:38,535
which tells a service whether or
not to adjust for daylight savings, and

13
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:42,082
the service will give you back a time
zone based on that coordinate.

14
00:00:42,082 --> 00:00:46,545
It'll also tell you whether or not
that time zone is currently offset due

15
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:50,643
to daylight savings time and
the offset of that time zone from UTC,

16
00:00:50,643 --> 00:00:53,585
which stands for
Coordinated Universal Time.

17
00:00:53,585 --> 00:00:59,793
Don't ask me why it's UTC and CUT,
maybe they didn't want to name it cut.

18
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,309
Let's do a quick example
of the Time Zone API.

19
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,900
I'm going to make a quick
Time Zone API request.

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,210
Notice the same name space again.

21
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:10,400
I'm going to request
the response in JSON format, and

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,965
I'm going to make the request for
this specific lat-long.

23
00:01:13,965 --> 00:01:19,158
I'm passing in the time stamp in seconds
which you can usually find converters

24
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,193
online for, or a new code, you can
use the JavaScript date.now function,

25
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:26,253
and I'm passing in my API key.

26
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,334
Turns out,
this is in Japan standard time.

27
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:34,895
We see that there's currently no
offset for daylight savings time here,

28
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:40,465
and that the offset from UTC is
32,400 seconds, which is 9 hours.

29
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:43,363
Yeah, totally just did that in my head.

30
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:47,401
Incidentally, this location is
actually to Shiro-jima in Japan,

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,378
better known as Cat Island,
where there are more cats than humans.

32
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:52,650
Let's take a quiz meow.
