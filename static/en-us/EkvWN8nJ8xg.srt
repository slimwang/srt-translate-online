00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,920
Hopefully you successfully
created your tracker config file.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,383
It should be in the XML
folder in the RES folder.

3
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:13,028
A little hard to see, but
this is RES/XML, and this is the file,

4
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:14,814
this track_app.xml.

5
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:17,960
And again, you could have called your
config file whatever you wanted.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,340
So here's my tracking ID
in the ga_trackingId.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,250
Here's where I set autoActivity to true.

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,400
So I'll get the usage data any time
a user goes to any activities in my app.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,500
And here are the different
screen names that I've set.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,830
I've got the Main Screen,
the Order Dinner screen,

11
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,850
the Eradicate Dinner screen.

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,050
And these are names that were going to
appear in the Analytics dashboard.
