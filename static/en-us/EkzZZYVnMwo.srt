00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:04,165
Lets try it out. Here is our average program. If we just enter q immediately

2
00:00:04,165 --> 00:00:08,604
then it tells us NaN but what does NaN mean? Lets ask everybody on the

3
00:00:08,604 --> 00:00:12,444
Internet. Lets search for java NaN. Looks like other people have had this

4
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:17,876
question before and under the answers it says NaN stands for not a number. It's

5
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:21,494
produced if some floating point operation has some input parameters that cause

6
00:00:21,494 --> 00:00:26,730
the operation to produce some undefined result. For example, 0 divided by 0 is

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,076
arethmatically undefined. So we must have done some kind of math that was

8
00:00:31,076 --> 00:00:35,514
undefined. It seems like the most complicated piece of math we're doing here is

9
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:39,334
just this division. So let's print out what sum and count are. Here's a print

10
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:44,655
line statement from sum and count. And now, if I enter q immediately, it tells

11
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:49,990
me that sum and count are both 0. So it makes sense that I'm getting NaN; I'm

12
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,283
dividing by 0.
