1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,671
Usually, we just add numbers up and take the average. This doesn't work with

2
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:07,716
frames per second. And that's the problem with 'em. If you add the 4 values

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:12,744
together and divide by 4, you get 27.5 frames per second. That's not correct.

4
00:00:12,744 --> 00:00:16,952
however. Say we think about this question in terms of miles per hour. Instead

5
00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:21,640
of 400 frames, say you drive 400 miles. If you drive 25 miles per hour for the

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,280
first 100 miles, 50 miles per hour for the next, and so on. How long will the

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,870
trip take you? Divide 400 miles by this number of hours, and you'll get your

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:34,531
average number of miles per hour. Using this idea, we see that the first set of

9
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:37,911
frame takes 4 seconds to view, the second; 2 seconds, third; 4 seconds, and the

10
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:44,550
fourth; 10 seconds. A total of 20 seconds. 400 frames divided by 20 seconds is

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,718
20 frames per second. This answer is a little surprising in that it's lower

12
00:00:48,718 --> 00:00:53,254
than 3 of the 4 frame values mentioned. The duration of the 10 frames per

13
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:57,360
second portion of our test is so long, that it pulls the average down.
