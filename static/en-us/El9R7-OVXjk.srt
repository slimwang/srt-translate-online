1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,100
So, we're looking for Katrina's speed alone, that would be without the current.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,162
We know when she goes upriver or upstream, she goes 15 miles. So this distance

3
00:00:09,162 --> 00:00:12,622
is 15. She has to come back to her original starting point, so that means she

4
00:00:12,622 --> 00:00:17,002
has to go another 15 miles. To get back where she started. That would be her

5
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:22,000
distance downstream. We know the speed of the current is 5 miles per hour, but

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,635
we don't know Katrina's speed. It's x. So, if Katrina is travelling downstream,

7
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:31,891
she travels faster. So that would be x which is our speed plus the current

8
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:36,274
which is 5. If Katrina is traveling upstream she's fighting the current, so

9
00:00:36,274 --> 00:00:41,523
she's going slower. So that would be x minus 5. Whenever we work with these

10
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:45,588
motion problems and a current. We'll always add or subtract the current to

11
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:50,538
whatever speed our person or object is going. So in this case Katrina's speed

12
00:00:50,538 --> 00:00:54,160
was x. So we need to add the current for her downstream speed and subtract the

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,728
current for her upstream speed. Now we're ready to find expressions for the

14
00:00:58,728 --> 00:01:03,931
time. We know the time is distance divided by rate. So going upstream we'll

15
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:10,050
have 15 divided by x minus 5. And going down stream we'll have 15 divided by

16
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,593
the quantity x plus 5. Now this was pretty tough, so if you got at least part

17
00:01:14,593 --> 00:01:16,550
of this right, great work.
