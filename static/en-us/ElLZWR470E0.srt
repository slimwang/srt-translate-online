1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,655
Therefore, after we know the slope and a point on the line, we can find the

2
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:09,710
y-intercept. After that we'll have an equation for the line. And once we know

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,150
this equation, we'll be able to find any other point on the line. And therefore

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,389
use our equation to make predictions. Here we know that since a point on the

5
00:00:19,389 --> 00:00:24,570
line is x bar comma y bar. We can plug that into our equation and now we can

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,430
solve for a by subtracting 0.2 times x bar on both sides of the equation. These

7
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:38,950
cancel out and we're left with a on this side equals y bar minus 0.2 times x

8
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:44,325
bar. Now that we have our formula for a, the y-intercept, find what this

9
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:48,030
y-intercept is for our regression line for flight costs.
