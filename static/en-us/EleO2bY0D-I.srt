1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,844
To find the numbers here, we list the factor pairs of 24. 1 and 24 is a factor

2
00:00:04,844 --> 00:00:09,597
pair, since they multiply to give us 24. After 1, I should try 2. Well, 24 is

3
00:00:09,597 --> 00:00:14,554
even, so 2 definitely goes into it. 2 times 12 is 24. 3 goes into 24 as well, so

4
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:19,602
3 times 8 is another factor pair. 4 and 6 is another factor pair. I know that 5

5
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:24,222
doesn't go into 24, because, since this number doesn't end in a 0 or a 5. And

6
00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:28,954
then, if i try 6, I repeat a factor pair, so really, I'm done here. Any higher

7
00:00:28,954 --> 00:00:33,712
factor pairs will be repeated like 8 and 3, 12 and 2, and 24 and 1, so I look at

8
00:00:33,712 --> 00:00:38,392
my list of factor pairs and I see which pair adds to 10. Well, 4 and 6 add to

9
00:00:38,392 --> 00:00:43,466
10, so that must be the answer. Here are the factor pairs for 36. And notice

10
00:00:43,466 --> 00:00:48,113
that I've only listed the positive factors here. We could also have negative 1

11
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:52,466
and negative 36, but we'll talk about that later. I just want to find the pair

12
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:57,133
that adds to 13. 4 and 9 add to 13, so that must be my answers for my number

13
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:00,031
puzzle. Great work if you got those two right.
