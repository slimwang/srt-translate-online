00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,190
So hey, that was great.

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,030
I hope you guys had fun programming all this.

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,770
Let's get back to some more theory.

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,230
I'm going to give you a very tricky data set.

5
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,200
There's a couple of pluses and

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,090
I've clustered around the origin of this coordinate system, x and y.

7
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,890
And there's a whole bunch of o's that lie more in the periphery.

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,190
And give what you've learned so far.

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,710
Do you think support vector machines give you a good answer here?

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,240
Will support vector machines work?

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,460
YES or NO?
