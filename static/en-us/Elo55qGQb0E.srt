00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,130
Is it okay to just use a cell phone
camera to record video of your users?

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,630
Is there any minimum
required video product?

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:16,370
>> Honestly, the minimum required video
product is a flip phone from the 90s.

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,235
>> Okay.
>> Right,

5
00:00:17,235 --> 00:00:21,130
recording video is
the most important thing.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:26,870
As long as you have some kind of video,
from some angle, somewhere, it works.

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,220
Ideally you have a cell phone, a cell
phone video is fine, laptop is fine.

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,910
If you have a professional camera,
feel free to bring it.

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,960
But actually sometimes bringing
a professional camera Is too much.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,575
>> Right.
>> You don't need that quality,

11
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:41,675
that high quality video, right?

12
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,930
You're not making an Apple promo video.

13
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,690
All you need is enough to put up
on a conference room screen for

14
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,770
somebody else to see, either a VC or
a PM or your engineers.

15
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,570
>> Right.
>> Or even other designers.

16
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,240
Right, because humans are really good
at figuring out the emotional import of

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,150
video, even if it's grainy and low res.

18
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,940
>> Yeah, and if you do bring
a big professional camera,

19
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:09,130
it might make your test subjects
feel a little bit intimidated.

20
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,420
You don't need to bring lights, you
don't need to bring a boom microphone or

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,700
anything like that.

22
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,510
Just have a little cell phone camera,
prop it up on something.

23
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,635
You can get one of those twisty
tripods to stick your camera on.

24
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:24,782
There are other little tiny flip cams,
little video cameras,

25
00:01:24,782 --> 00:01:29,280
with actual quarter inch holes in
the bottom to stick onto tripods.

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,090
Those work great too, but
the main goal is keep it informal so

27
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,870
the people don't feel insinuated,
but just collect some kind of video.

28
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,440
>> Right.
>> One thing to note is that audio is

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,570
also really important.

30
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,890
And so, cell phones generally do a
pretty good job of recording audio, but

31
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,660
it's worth checking the audio to
make sure that you can understand

32
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,170
what the people are saying.

33
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,390
Again, you don't need a boom mic,
you don't need to mic the person, but

34
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,830
it's really useful to make
sure that you can hear them.

35
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,930
One thing you can actually
do is buy a separate,

36
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,210
higher quality audio recorder which
tend to be fairly small and unobtrusive.

37
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,670
Hit record, put it on the table,
leave it there running, clap or

38
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,074
something in the video to sync
up the audio and the video.

39
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:12,630
>> Mm-hm.
>> And then just leave the audio out of

40
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,350
the video recorder, and
use the audio from the table recorder.

41
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,740
>> Right.
>> Which tends to be much better.

42
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,930
>> Awesome, thank you.
