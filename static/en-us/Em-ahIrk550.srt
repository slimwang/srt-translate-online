1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer is both of them are false.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We already saw that conditional independence, as shown over here,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
doesn't give us absolute independence.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So, for example, this is test #1 and test #2.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You might or might not have cancer.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Our first test gives us information about whether you have cancer or not.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
As a result, we've changed our prior probability

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
for the second test to come in positive.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That means that conditional independence does not imply absolute independence,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
which means this assumption here falls,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and it also turns out that if you have absolute independence,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
things might not be conditionally independent for reasons that I can't quite explain so far,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but that we will learn about next.
