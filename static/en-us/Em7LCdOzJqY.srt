1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,350
Now let's focus on signifiers, for feedback and

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,310
discoverability as they relate to our timebank user interface.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,480
>> The actions that we need to do, initiating a transaction initiating

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,460
an exchange with someone so how do you tell, so you gotta

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,200
be in range. With somebody else, for example doing an exchange. What

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,346
are some elements of feedback that would say, when somebody is in range?

7
00:00:24,346 --> 00:00:25,321
>> The

8
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:29,540
noise, yeah, ping.

9
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,300
>> So, you got sound channels?

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,810
>> Or just visual feedback, if you see a map and see other people on it.

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,280
>> Alright, let's draw out. Each of you draw like five,

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,410
five examples of how you know when somebody else is in range.

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,810
>> Like geographical range you mean?

14
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:45,150
>> Yeah.

15
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,340
>> Okay.

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,720
>> Let's, let's say it's, in it for those of you technical. It's like

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,970
Blue Tooth, and needs to be within ten meters but we'll say ten feet.
