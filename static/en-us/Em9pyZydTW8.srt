00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,330
Physicians usually start collecting
data by interviewing the patient,

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,710
beginning with their chief complaint,
the reason for their current visit.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,630
They ask about other problems and
obtain the history of those.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,330
To further explore the chief complaint,
they ask about symptoms,

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,420
manifestations of the problem
that the patient has noticed, and

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,220
they physically examine the patient.
