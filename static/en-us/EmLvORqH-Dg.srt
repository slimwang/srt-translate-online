00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let me draw the cancer example again with two tests.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here's my cancer variable

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and then there's two conditionally independent tests T1 and T2.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And as before let me assume that the prior probability of cancer is 0.01

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What I want you to compute for me is the probability of the second test

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to be positive if we know that the first test was positive.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So write this into the following box.
