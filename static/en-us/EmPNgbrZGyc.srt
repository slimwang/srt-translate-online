1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,969
So now that we are done with the work for Cycle Four let's see what happens in

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,700
Cycle Five. Two things will happen in Cycle Five.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,810
One is we are going to try to issue the next instruction. Another thing is,

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,850
we're going to try to see if we can dispatch an instruction, write the result,

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:20,770
or comment. Obviously we can issue this instruction so let's do that.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,030
So, the question for you is do we dispatch an instruction. Right here,

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,690
which instruction gets dispatched? Leave it empty if none of them gets

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,980
dispatched. Another question for you is, do we write any results in this cycle?

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:39,290
If yes, write which instruction gets to write the results. If no, just leave

10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,820
this empty and obviously we won't be committing any instructions. The name of

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,950
the instruction here should be the, really the ROB entry. So if it's for

12
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,520
example the ROB1 instruction that gets dispatched you should write ROB1 here.
