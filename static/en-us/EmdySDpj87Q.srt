00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,218
So to give you an example of the biological basis of introversion and

2
00:00:04,218 --> 00:00:09,551
extraversion. Researchers measured the level of introversion and extraversion

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:13,711
and then simply shined a light of the same intensity into everyone's eye, one

4
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:18,420
at a time. As you know, pupils constrict when being exposed to a sudden

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,339
increase in light. So they get smaller. So based on Eysenck's theory of the

6
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:28,886
biological basis of introversion and extraversion. Whose pupil do you think

7
00:00:28,886 --> 00:00:34,344
will constrict or respond most to the light? Do you think introverts' eyes will

8
00:00:34,344 --> 00:00:38,478
constrict the most or extraverts'? Chose one.
