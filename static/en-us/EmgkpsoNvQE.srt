2
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:12,230
What are you doing there, RJ?

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,169
>> I'm geocaching.

4
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:16,929
It's like a treasure hunt, except that
we use lat longs instead of an x.

5
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:18,140
>> Wow, that sounds awesome.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,810
Sounds like you're using
lots of geoconcepts.

7
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:22,939
Let's take the time to
talk about geocoding and

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,190
other location web services instead.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:25,940
>> GeoGreat.

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,200
Geocoding is one of the many
location services available via

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,929
the Google Maps APIs.

12
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:36,619
For the next few lessons,
we'll demonstrate using these services.

13
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:40,452
It's important to note that, most of
these services can be used either on

14
00:00:40,453 --> 00:00:44,280
the service side, for example, as part
of a process you run in a script, or

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,280
client side as part of
a user facing code.

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,120
The functionality is likely
the same in each service, but

17
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,000
obviously the syntax
is a little different.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,969
And there are different
reasons to use them.

19
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:57,719
>> The server side option is ideal,
when you already have

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,460
data that you need to do a bunch of
stuff with, with no user input needed.

21
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,280
Like a list of 100 points for
which you need to get information,

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,320
such as the address, the coordinate,
the time zone, or nearby schools.

23
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,379
When you make a web service
request in this way,

24
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:15,229
results can be returned in
either JSON or XML format.

25
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,850
>> But sometimes you may
not have data in advance.

26
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:19,890
The addresses, user location, or

27
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,420
other requests come in dynamically
as part of the user input.

28
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,599
Maybe a user clicks on a map to
indicate his or her current location.

29
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,297
And wants to find movie theaters nearby.

30
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:33,909
These type of situations are ideal for
client side services.

31
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:35,810
>> As we go into this in more detail,

32
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,540
keep in mind that we structure all the
web services requests in the same way.

33
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,720
We put in their required parameters and
we get back a textual response.

34
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:47,209
Let's start out by explaining
the Geocoding Service via an http

35
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:48,339
request in our browser.
