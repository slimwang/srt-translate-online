1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This brings us to a point where we can ask one of the most fundamental questions in theoretical

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
computer science and that is does P=NP and in particular, here's what we actually know.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is true. We know that every problem that's in P is in NP and every problem that is NP is in EXP,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that is to say any problem that you can solve in polynomial time,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
we can certainly solve in non-deterministic polynomial time,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and any problem that we can solve in a non-deterministic polynomial time,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
we can also solve in exponential time, but here's what we don't know.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It could be the case that the class NP is actually equal to the class EXP.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That is to say the set of problems that we can solve in a non-deterministic polynomial time

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
might be exactly the same as the ones that we can solve in exponential time.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So there's a sort of outer set and that's distinct from say this inner set,

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
which is the set of problems that are solvable in polynomial time.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
There's one other thing that we know, we do know that there really

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
is a difference between polynomial and exponential time.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There's some problems that can be solved in exponential time that are definitely not NP.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So we know those two things are different, but we don't really know.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It could be that NP is equal to x. It could also that P is equal to NP.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So the problems that we can solve in a non-deterministic polynomial time

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
might be exactly the same as the ones that we can solve in polynomial time,

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
which both would be then different from exponential time

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
or could very well be that there are really three different categories here.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That problems that are in NP don't necessarily require exponential time,

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
but they may not be solvable in polynomial time either--we don't know.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So this question of whether or not P=NP, whether we're in this case here is a pretty heavy question.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So what happens if P does equal NP. Well, a lot people say a lot of different things.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's turn this into a quiz to see what you think.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So one possibility is that cryptographic protocols, so things were keeping secrets in encrypting data

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
that are based on problems like factoring that are in NP could be cracked.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Another is that there's a whole lot of computer science theoreticians

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
who will be suddenly out of work because they will no longer be having to think about this problem.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Another possible outcome might be that with P equal to NP

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
that means the computers will be smarter than people.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
They will be able to solve problems fast that people can't.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So I don't know, just tell me which one you think is true.
