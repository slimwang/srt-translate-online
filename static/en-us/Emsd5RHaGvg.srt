00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:05,470
Let's jump in to some real code and
add a service worker to our Weather App.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,970
The first thing we need to do
is register our service worker.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,110
But wait, what if the browser
doesn't support service workers?

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,720
We want to progressively
add features and

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,190
we only want to do this if
the browser support service workers.

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,619
Using progressive enhancement
like this has little overhead and

7
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:28,370
won't break in older browsers.
