1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,220
Let us begin by asking ourselves,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,340
why do we need use formal logic to design an AI agent? The way the formal logic

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,270
in an AI agent would work is that there will be two parts to the AI agent.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,540
The first part of the agent will consist of a knowledge base.

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,165
The knowledge will contain the agents knowledge all over the world.

6
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:22,590
That knowledge will be represented in sentences in the language of logic.

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,920
The second part will consist of an inference engine. The inference engine will

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,930
apply rules of inference to the knowledge that the agent has. So remember again,

9
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,140
two parts, the knowledge base and then rules of inference. Now there are certain

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,750
situations in which we want the AI agent to be able to show, to be able to prove

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,140
that the answers, that it derives to any problem in fact are provably correct.

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,833
If we want to show this to itself, or to other users. In other situations,

13
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:56,270
we may want the AI agent to generate only provably correct solutions. How can we

14
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:00,140
guarantee that? Well we need two things. First, we need a complete and

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,260
correct knowledge base. And second, we need rules of inference that will give

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,330
guarantees of correctness of the answer. The inference then has two parts to it.

17
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,400
The first part is called soundness. The property of soundness means that

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,320
rules of inference will derive only those conclusions that are,

19
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,480
in fact, valid. The second property is completeness. The property of

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,990
completeness means that the [UNKNOWN] will derive all of the valid conclusions.

21
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,760
These are two very important properties to have. If an AI agent can use

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,190
logical rules, logical rules of inference on its knowledge base and

23
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,260
provide guaranteed soundness and completeness, then it's a very useful thing for

24
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,340
an AI agent to have. For this reason, logic has been an important part of

25
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,935
AI since the inception of the field. In fact it continues to be

26
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:49,760
an important part of research and modeling AI. In this course however we'll

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,380
discuss logic only to a very limited degree. There are two reasons for

28
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,205
this. First, our priorities in this course are a little different.

29
00:01:57,205 --> 00:02:01,000
Instead of talking about knowledge in the form of logical sentences, we are much

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,700
more interested in conceptual knowledge and experiential knowledge and

31
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,470
heuristic knowledge. Second, recall that we said that a logic

32
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:14,360
based agent has two parts to it, the knowledge base and the rules of inferences.

33
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,990
Even if the rules of inferences are, in fact, guaranteed to be sound and

34
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,150
complete, there is a problem about how do we construct a correct and

35
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,690
complete knowledge base? If the knowledge base of an AI agent is not correct and

36
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,250
complete, then it may not gave you useful answers,

37
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,780
even if the roots of inference are sound and complete. Thus, in this course,

38
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,300
we'll use logic only to the degree to which it is useful for

39
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,130
specifying other methods. Methods that use conceptual knowledge or

40
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,040
experiential knowledge or heuristic knowledge.
