1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,325
So, when talking about imitation, we see the nature side. In that, all the

2
00:00:04,325 --> 00:00:07,939
children began to speak at about the same time. And they were able to use

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:12,141
language as functional tool. And we also see the nurture side. And this was the

4
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:16,930
number of words that children were exposed to based on their family type. And

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,469
also whether they heard more encouraging words or discouraging words. So, the

6
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:24,507
important point to take home here is that we should try to expose our little

7
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:29,910
ones to as many words as possible, to increase their vocabulary. You may ask

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,320
why is vocabulary important? Well, Hart and Risley found an interesting study.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,196
They found a strong positive correlation between children's vocabulary size at

10
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:43,760
age three and their language test scores at age nine and ten. Now remember that

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,444
this is a correlational study, so we can't see there was a cause and effect

12
00:00:46,444 --> 00:00:51,009
relationship. But it is a nice demonstration of how powerful different

13
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,470
environments are in terms of language development.
