00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,180
Okay. So, Michael, I want to go into some algorithms,

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,710
or at least some classes of algorithms but before we do

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,270
that, I think it's useful to really ask a very simple

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,880
question, which is exactly how hard is this problem. And to

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,790
help answer that we're going to do a quiz, because you

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,980
like quizzes, and I'm going to define my terms just a

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,320
little bit better but maybe not that much better. So, here's

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,909
the quiz. You've got a set of data with N features.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,040
And your goal is to find a subset of M

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,220
features. Where the size of that subset is no greater than

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,570
the original subset. Which makes sense. The original set of

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,780
features in which makes sense. Okay? And that's it. And so,

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,580
what I want you to be able to tell me

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,780
is given this generic problem of starting with N features and

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,970
finding a subset of M features How long does it

16
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,542
take in terms of time complexity to do. Is it linear,

17
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:55,384
quadratic, polynomial, or exponential nm?

18
00:00:55,384 --> 00:00:57,694
>> Polynomial includes linear quadratic so you mean

19
00:00:57,694 --> 00:01:00,220
sort of of polynomial that's not linear quadratic.

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,930
>> That's right and I mean quadratic as not linear.

21
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,599
>> Got it.

22
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,490
>> And I mean exponential that's not polynomial or quadratic or linear.

23
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,160
>> It's not.

24
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,240
>> Well it could be. You could have 2 to the

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,830
n plus n squared for example, times 0. You could do it.

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,680
Don't mess with me man. Okay, so you got the problem?

27
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,990
>> Just to make sure I understand. So, so, can

28
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,060
you draw like a rectangle? Like our input space x?

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,430
>> Okay. So we've got some input space x. This is a rectangle.

30
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,750
>> And it's got n features, so those are like the columns.

31
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,650
>> Okay.

32
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,630
>> Alright. And we're going to select a subset

33
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,900
m of those n features. So we'll have

34
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,040
a like, a skinnier matrix, but not shorter.

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,920
>> Mm-hm. Right.

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,635
>> Alright, so and, can I choose any way I want to to define what

37
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:54,900
subsets I like better than which other subsets,

38
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,300
because then I can do this really fast.

39
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,830
>> So what we're going to do is there's going to be some function,

40
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,400
let's just call it F, okay, which given a set of features,

41
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,650
return a score. Oh, that looks sort of familiar.

42
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,848
>> Mm-hm. And this function may be arbitrarily complicated, it

43
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:15,950
may be really simple, but you don't know what it is.

44
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,230
>> Oh. Alright. Then I think, I think I can answer this question now.

45
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,550
>> Okay, so let's go.
