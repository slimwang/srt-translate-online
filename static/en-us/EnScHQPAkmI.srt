00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,280
Welcome to lesson two.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,680
In this lesson we talk more about
cultural differences between Dev and

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,080
Ops working groups.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,160
We'll also focus on one
specific area of difficulty,

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,320
compatibility between development and
production environments.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,210
>> As we've said before,

7
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,030
you can't solve cultural tensions just
by deploying some software tools.

8
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,480
But in this specific area, we can make
a big difference by making it much,

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,650
much easier for
people to build compatible environments.

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,810
The tool we use to do this
is called Packer, and

11
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,980
what it does is to build standard
deployment images that will work in both

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,730
production and development systems.
