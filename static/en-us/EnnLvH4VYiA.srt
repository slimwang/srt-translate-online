1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
One last thing and we've been avoiding bringing this up until now,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but it's something you as an entrepreneur should know, it's a secret.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And it's a secret that we didn't even understand for a long time and that secret is

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
there are four types of startups and not knowing which type you are can really sink your company.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So we call this market type. It turns out that there really are four types of markets for startups.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
One is existing market. Another is where you take a segment or re-segment an existing market.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Another is a new market and another is a clone market.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So let's take a look why this is important and then we'll give you the definition of each one.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It turns out that the type of market changes everything.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It changes your initial market size, how much it cost to enter the market,

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
what kind of launch you do with your product, it affects the type of competitive barriers you have,

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and how you position or describe your product.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It affects your sales model. Are you going to hire direct sales? When do you hire them?

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What kind of margins you should have or the profits?

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
How long it takes, that is the sale cycle and something called the chasm width,

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
which we'll take a look in a sec.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It also affects how much money you're going to need to raise

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and how long it takes to get the profitability and then finally, it affects the types of customers

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and what they're needs are and how long it takes to adapt?

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So, what are the things this looks like is just a checklist of market type seems to affect everything.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What the heck can it be? So let's go a little further and define.
