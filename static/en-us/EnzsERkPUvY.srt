00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
When we want to model a wildfire, heat transport is obviously a vital phenomenon to consider.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's going to occupy us for the major part of this unit.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
To get started, let's look at this system.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's a tank that completely isolated from its environment.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and that contains two different compartments one that is filled with water that's initially hot

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and another compartment that's filled with water that's initially cool.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Now, I want you to describe the flow of heat from one compartment to the other

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and the temporal evolution of the temperature of the left part

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and the temporal evolution of the temperature of the right part.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Temperature is just another expression for energy.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Energy is being exchanged between those two compartments.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
To include that idea in our equations, we should be using the Kelvin scale for temperatures,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
not the Celsius scale and not the Fahrenheit scale.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
At least for an ideal gas, the temperature measured on the Kelvin scale

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
is proportional to the energy content of that gas.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To model the system, we could say that for instance that every hour

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
10% of the energy content of the left compartment flows to the right compartment

18
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the same percentage per hour would flow from the right compartment to the left compartment.
