00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,620
One of the most aggravating things about input on

00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,980
the mobile web platform is the security prompts. One of

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,330
the early challenges of the sensors of the mobile

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,770
web platform was the security sandbox that's inherent in the

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,060
web. Most of the sensors do require permission, but

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,550
you can frequently limit how many times the user is

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,490
prompted by using https instead of http. Usually this

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,300
means they'll only get prompted once and the system will

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,420
remember it after that.
