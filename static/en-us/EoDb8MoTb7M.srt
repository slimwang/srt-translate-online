1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Well, it turns out that this finite state machine accepts [a - z]+ or [0 - 9]+,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but we don't need to know that to answer the question.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We can just start at the start state.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We see an 'a'. We end up in state 2, and state 2 is an accepting state, so we accept.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The empty string--we come in here in state 1, and we don't go anywhere

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
because we're out of input.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
State 1 is not an accepting state, so, no.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
'Havel 1936' starts with an uppercase H.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We actually don't have any outgoing edges on uppercase H,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
so we fall off immediately and do not accept.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Lowercase 'havel 2011'--that's just looking good.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
h-a-v-e-l, and we're still in state 2, and then we see the 2,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and now we fall off because this accepts either words or numbers, but not combinations.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Then finally '1993'--1-9-9-3. Yes!

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Vaclav Havel was a Czech writer/intellectual and the first president of the Czech Republic

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,077
in 1993.
