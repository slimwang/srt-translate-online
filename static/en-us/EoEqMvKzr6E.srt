00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,437
Both the HTML, and the CSS are critical resources. So this is 2. We had to get,

2
00:00:07,437 --> 00:00:14,710
both resources. Yep. 5 kilobytes for the HTML and 4 kilobytes for the CSS.

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,770
so that's, a 9, total kilobytes. And

4
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,107
critical path length. Hm. Let's see, best case

5
00:00:22,107 --> 00:00:26,570
scenario, I think there are two round trips. One round trip to get the HTML and

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,030
then receive its response. And then another round trip to get the CSS

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,000
and receive its response. So I think the critical path length is 2.

00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,360
>> Correct. Great stuff.
