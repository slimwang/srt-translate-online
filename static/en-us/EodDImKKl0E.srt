00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,740
That's right, this layout on the left
would be better if we have decided that

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,620
posting is the primary
focus of our platform.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,010
It allows the user to perform
that action from the home screen

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,540
while giving them the option to go to
another screen to perform other actions.

00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,590
It's important to note that the design
on the right is not a bad design either.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,090
But focuses on a different
primary action,

00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,850
reading content from other sources.

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,100
There are even platforms which allow
you to do both on the main page,

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,174
which is primarily useful for social
networking sites like Facebook, Tumblr,

10
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:36,320
or Twitter, where interaction between
content creators is the primary purpose.
