00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,626
The baby spent nearly all of its time with this mother, and would even cling to

2
00:00:03,626 --> 00:00:08,550
this mother to lean over to feed from the wire mother. This really showed us

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,362
that food and nutrition aren't the only things that go into attachment. We need

4
00:00:12,362 --> 00:00:16,998
a warm secure caregiver also to form an attachment. So remember then we see

5
00:00:16,998 --> 00:00:20,898
that attachment is not just about food and nutrition. In fact other studies

6
00:00:20,898 --> 00:00:24,580
have shown that animals will choose a fake mother that resembles their own.
