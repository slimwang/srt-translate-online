1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,742
So let's talk about magnetic disks, which today usually means a hard disk, or a

2
00:00:05,742 --> 00:00:09,300
hard drive. But the so-called floppy disks are

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,290
also magnetic disks, and work very much along

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,960
the same lines. It's just that today we

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,100
mostly have hard drives, and few people even

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,290
remember floppy drives. A magnetic disk has a

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,806
spindle to which we can attach so-called platters.

8
00:00:26,806 --> 00:00:29,302
All of the platters are attached to the

9
00:00:29,302 --> 00:00:32,110
same spindle and rotate at the same speed,

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,790
let's say in this direction. There is a

11
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,886
motor here that really drives the spindle to rotate

12
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:43,350
and that causes all the platters to rotate at the same speed. If we look at the

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,380
single platter it has a surface covered with

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:52,730
magnetic material on one side and also on another.

15
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,086
So this drive that has three platters

16
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:58,390
usually will have total of six surfaces. The

17
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:06,310
data bits are on all the surfaces. We access this data by having a magnetic head

18
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:12,210
attached to an arm and another one for the lower surface. And then all of these

19
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,890
heads are attached to a head assembly which can move all the heads in unison.

20
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,018
So if this head is here, this head

21
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:23,134
will be in the same position on another platter,

22
00:01:23,134 --> 00:01:26,120
and so on. We don't individually move the heads,

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,750
we move them all at the same time. So

24
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,265
because the platter is rotating and the head

25
00:01:32,265 --> 00:01:35,875
is staying in place usually, the head will be

26
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,295
able to access this circle on the surface of

27
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:43,470
the disk. Each head will be able to access

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,270
the circle on its own surface, and all of these are going to be at the same

29
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:56,388
distance from the spindle. This is called a track. All of the tracks

30
00:01:56,388 --> 00:01:59,085
at the same distance from the spindle

31
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:02,843
form what is called a cylinder. The cylinder

32
00:02:02,843 --> 00:02:05,499
simply consists of one track from each

33
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:08,651
surface where the tracks in the cylinders are

34
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:11,807
those that can be accessed by different heads

35
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:14,808
at the same time. So for example here,

36
00:02:14,808 --> 00:02:17,112
there are six heads. When they stay in

37
00:02:17,112 --> 00:02:20,689
this position and all the platters rotate, they're able

38
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:23,950
to access the six racks of that cylinder.

39
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,140
The way we access different tracks on the

40
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,310
disk is by moving the head so that

41
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,950
it comes closer or gets further from the spindle.

42
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,050
And that way we can access the entire

43
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,780
area of each surface. So the data, naturally, will

44
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,020
be organized into bits that are positioned along

45
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,550
the track, and then another track will have different

46
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,419
bits and so on. If you look at the surface from above, and this is now the

47
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:55,290
spindle, this is would be one track and

48
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,014
this would be another. And finally on one track

49
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:03,238
we don't store data continuously through the track

50
00:03:03,238 --> 00:03:06,022
because usually a lot of bits are on

51
00:03:06,022 --> 00:03:09,478
a single track, instead the data along one

52
00:03:09,478 --> 00:03:14,000
track is divided into sectors. And a sector

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,527
will be the smallest unit that we can actually read. Now if the disk rotates in

54
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:21,341
this direction, and the head is currently here,

55
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:24,155
as the disk rotates, different bits of the sector

56
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:26,640
are going to be under the head. So the

57
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,304
sector will have some preamble here that is

58
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:32,190
a recognizable bit pattern that tells the head

59
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,250
that this is the beginning of a sector.

60
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,330
Then we have the appropriate number of the

61
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,410
bits for the sector that actually hold the

62
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,194
data, followed usually by some checksum and other

63
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:49,242
information that is needed to possibly correct errors

64
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:52,500
in the sector. And then another sector would just

65
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,710
have the same things and so on. So when

66
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,280
the head assembly moves to a particular cylinder, then

67
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,000
the heads start listening for the beginning of the sector.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,160
Once they see the beginning of the sector and

69
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,960
see which sector it is, they know where they

70
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,475
are in the whole track. So the disk capacity

71
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:15,000
can be computed as the number of platters times 2.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,779
This will really be the number of surfaces times how many tracks we have per

73
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:25,030
surface. Or expressed in another way how many

74
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,464
cylinders do we have on these disks times

75
00:04:28,464 --> 00:04:34,221
how many sectors do we have per track times how many bytes of data do we

76
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:39,946
have in each sector. Usually we have a small number of platters, such as one,

77
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,910
two, three, maybe four. We have thousands

78
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,682
of tracks per surface, tens to hundreds sectors

79
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:51,086
per track, and something like a kilobyte or

80
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:53,846
maybe a half of kilobyte of bytes per

81
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:57,255
sector. So sectors are usually like kilobytish

82
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,690
in size. We have about 100, let's say,

83
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,970
sectors per track, maybe a little bit more,

84
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,680
and we have thousands of tracks per surface.

85
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,446
Obviously, the whole thing needs to be very thin

86
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:12,055
so these platters are really close to each other.

87
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:14,535
It needs to be, let's say, two and a

88
00:05:14,535 --> 00:05:18,375
half inches wide total, including the head assembly and

89
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,198
so on. So the platters are only a couple

90
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:24,222
of inches in diameter and because we have so

91
00:05:24,222 --> 00:05:27,750
many tracks per surface that means that the tracks

92
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,942
are spaced very, very close to each other and

93
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:36,360
the head assembly needs to be very, very precise in how it positions heads.
