1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,812
So, now let's look at the brain and what happens when we're engaging in short

2
00:00:02,812 --> 00:00:06,916
term or working memory. Here we see that the prefrontal cortex focuses

3
00:00:06,916 --> 00:00:11,076
attention on a sensory stimuli, and will hold the information long enough for

4
00:00:11,076 --> 00:00:16,663
us to solve the problem at hand. Then it will transfer the information to the

5
00:00:16,663 --> 00:00:20,982
hippocampus for memory consolidation. We also know that the encoding stage of

6
00:00:20,982 --> 00:00:25,315
memory is consolidated through rehearsal and repetition. So, if we repeatedly

7
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:29,150
fire the neural impulses that are necessary to convert a short term memory to a

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:35,196
long term memory, this will occur in the hippocampus. Now, the main reason

9
00:00:35,196 --> 00:00:39,344
Henry Molaison or HM, could no longer form long term memories is because a

10
00:00:39,344 --> 00:00:44,424
large part of his hippocampus was removed. But as I said, we know that the

11
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:48,796
hippocampus isn't the only thing that's important for working memory. We also

12
00:00:48,796 --> 00:00:52,111
need our prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for our ability to maintain

13
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:56,399
attention and focus. So, when you're reading, having a conversation or looking

14
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,739
at a map. When trying to figure out directions, it's our prefrontal cortex that

15
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:05,375
allows us to keep this information available. Do you remember earlier in the

16
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:10,020
lesson when we discussed the visuospatial sketchpad in phonological loop? Well,

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,548
we see that in each of these areas is where brain activity occurs during each

18
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:18,167
of these processes. So, we know that auditory input is processed and rehearsed

19
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:22,930
in the phonological loop from the prefrontal cortex. To the language

20
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,470
comprehension center, which is located to the back and left part of the

21
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,389
parietal lobes. We call this language comprehension center, the Wernicke's

22
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:35,328
region, after the person who discovered it. You may remember this when we

23
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:39,471
talked about it in lesson three. As for visual information in the visuo spatial

24
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:44,094
sketchpad, it goes from the prefrontal cortex to the temporal lobes for spatial

25
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:50,788
information. And then to the occipital lobe for visual information. Now, we

26
00:01:50,788 --> 00:01:54,180
know that our explicit memory storage are stored in the respective cortex in

27
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:00,100
the area that it was originally processed. Now, other types of memories such as

28
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,455
implicit memories are stored in structures of the subcortex, specifically the

29
00:02:04,455 --> 00:02:07,845
striatum, amygdala and cerebellum.
