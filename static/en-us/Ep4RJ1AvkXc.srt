00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,030
In this lesson we examined in more
detail exactly how data from multiple

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,380
EHR systems can be queried and
aggregated for diverse purposes,

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,800
from quality reporting to
advanced clinical research.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,660
All of these technologies serve the
essential role of providing a framework

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,420
over the many non inoperable
EHR systems deployed today.

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,710
Taken together they illustrate different
technological solutions, each of which

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,510
is optimized for a specific problem in
a specific cross institutional context.
