00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,270
Remember in the beginning of this lesson, we asked you

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,760
to think about your favorite app? Mine was Google Now. So

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,640
take a moment and play with that, your favorite application. And

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,590
take into account all the stuff you learned in lesson one.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,940
And then go to the forum, and share with everyone why

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,550
you love this application. So take the time to think about

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,280
whether the things you love are visual or non-visual. Whether they're

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,440
UI or UX related. So as developers, this is going to

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,800
be an awesome opportunity for you to share your design opinions.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,460
>> And if you see someone else, bad mouthing an application that you're

11
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,190
passionate about, take this as a opportunity

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,350
to understand that there's many, many different

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,060
types of users out there. And, and really get an understanding of how different

14
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,740
people feel about applications, and we'll pick up on this in less than two.
