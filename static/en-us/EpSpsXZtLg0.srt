00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,384
When it comes to the question of
whether you dive in head first or

3
00:00:12,384 --> 00:00:16,030
whether you take baby steps, I think
the answer is probably that you do both.

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,360
Meaning you find a place where you
know you can make a difference.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,380
So, maybe that's going to be through
the automation of infrastructure, or

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,500
maybe that's going to be
improving test coverage.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,380
Maybe it's going to be implementing
some continuous integration, or

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,360
even a step toward continuous delivery.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,230
And you should really dive in with the
full intention to realize that value.

10
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,480
At the same time though you want Sir
Vigrid principles to be able to work for

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,860
you in this context.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,480
So, I don't know how a mountain
goat approaches the mountain right.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,700
But I think it's with the intention
of getting where it wants to go but

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,390
how does it do?

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,130
It it takes a tentative step and
each time it tests a little bit, right.

16
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:57,880
How did that work for

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,370
me and then moves forward and I think
that's the way that you should do it, so

18
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:06,030
you should bring your whole self
your whole intention to the effort.

19
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,510
I mean just give an example of what
going all the end could mean in

20
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,480
a negative way or in a different
context and you are then you by all

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,240
the things [LAUGH] you write, you buy
all the software, you hire a giant team.

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,080
I don't think you have
to start in that way.

23
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,490
I think what you have to be clear
about is where you want to get to and

24
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,895
what thing you're going to
do first to make an impact.

25
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:31,978
And I think that's
the thing you go all in on.

26
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:35,293

27
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:38,809
Often, the places where a DevOps
Engineer is going to be asked to start

28
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:42,564
working are in the places where the
organization is feeling the most pain or

29
00:01:42,564 --> 00:01:44,290
is suffering the most.

30
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,920
So, I guess there's nobility there
in the same way that there is for

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,790
an early responder.

32
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,990
I don't want to make
this overly dramatic.

33
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,310
There's a book that I really love,
it's called Your Code Is A Crime Scene.

34
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,660
And if that's real and there's some
evidence to support that idea,

35
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,320
the DevOps Engineer shows
up in that space and

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,460
is going to work to make things better.

37
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,830
So all in, on an area in
which you can make an effort,

38
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,918
that's really going to pay off.

39
00:02:09,918 --> 00:02:13,440
All in on some global sense,
like I have to decide early on

40
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,250
what tooling I pay for, I have to decide
early on what methodologies I use.

41
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,626
I think that might be a mistake.

42
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:22,320
As a matter of fact,
you'd be creating structure

43
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,530
ahead of any kind of learning and
that might be damaging.

44
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,580
So, I like the mountain goat metaphor.
