00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,346
Let's flip this around, keeping the light fixed and showing the effect on the

2
00:00:04,346 --> 00:00:08,470
sphere. In fact, throughout this unit, let's assume each light is extremely far

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,854
away like the sun. So, we can just look at its direction instead of its

4
00:00:11,854 --> 00:00:15,578
position. That way, we don't have to think about the light's direction changing

5
00:00:15,578 --> 00:00:19,658
as the surface changes position. Here, the sphere's normal changes with respect

6
00:00:19,658 --> 00:00:23,812
to the light. The light's effect is at a maximum at the top of the sphere, goes

7
00:00:23,812 --> 00:00:27,838
to 0 at the equator, and stays that way since the bottom of the sphere faces

8
00:00:27,838 --> 00:00:31,333
away from the light. This is what the diffused term looks like when the sphere

9
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:34,342
it is lit from above. This next point is a little subtle but I think it's worth

10
00:00:34,342 --> 00:00:38,603
going through. A diffused material is defined as one that scatters light in all

11
00:00:38,603 --> 00:00:42,885
directions above the plane according to this cosine law. So, this green shows

12
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:47,807
how the amount of light gathered actually drops off as the angle gets steeper.

13
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:51,852
That is, the amount of light from a single point on a surface drops off with the

14
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:55,764
cosine of the angle, the surface compared to the eye. So, you might think less

15
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,936
light would hit the eye when the surface is viewed from a shallow angle.

16
00:00:58,936 --> 00:01:02,652
However, a balancing factor is that, as the angle of the surface to the viewer

17
00:01:02,652 --> 00:01:06,422
increases, the area of the surface visible through the pixel proportionally

18
00:01:06,422 --> 00:01:10,435
increases. That is, you see more of the surface even though less light per unit

19
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:14,622
area is reflected towards the eye. These offsetting effects give the net result

20
00:01:14,622 --> 00:01:18,796
we want. The viewers location doesn't matter at all. As the shade of the surface

21
00:01:18,796 --> 00:01:23,390
depends only on the angle to the light itself. Not needing the eye direction

22
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,172
makes the diffuse term faster to compute, which is always important at an

23
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:28,523
interactive rendering.
