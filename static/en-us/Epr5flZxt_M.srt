00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,160
This diagram here,

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,580
with only the view property set,
reflects the state of our app right now.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,470
We've created our objects, but there
are still some connections missing.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,830
So we still need to create this action
and invoke it on the ViewController.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:21,040
We also need two properties, the count
property and the label property.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,340
Let's go add those to our code.
