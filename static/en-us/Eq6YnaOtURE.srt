00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,792
The quantity 2y minus 3z times the quantity 3x plus 4 is correct. Fantastic work

2
00:00:04,792 --> 00:00:09,404
for getting that one right. Now, I know we haven't covered negative signs yet,

3
00:00:09,404 --> 00:00:13,992
so don't worry if you didn't get it right. Let's see how we could do this. I can

4
00:00:13,992 --> 00:00:17,982
see that both this term and this term share a y, and also, they're both

5
00:00:17,982 --> 00:00:22,452
divisible by 2. So, 2y must by my greatest common factor. If I divide 2y into

6
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:27,355
6xy, I'm left with 3x. And if I divide 2y into 8y, I'm left with positive 4.

7
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:32,092
Here, this term is negative and this term is negative. The negative 9 and

8
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:37,150
negative 12 share a negative 3 as a common factor. They also share a z. Now, I

9
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:42,489
want to think about what two terms should go in here. What number times negative

10
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:47,957
3z will give me negative 9xz? That must be positive 3x. Then, I think about what

11
00:00:47,957 --> 00:00:53,298
number times negative 3z will give me negative 12z. This must be positive 4. And

12
00:00:53,298 --> 00:00:58,484
this is great. This first term and the second term share a common factor of 3x

13
00:00:58,484 --> 00:01:03,771
plus 4, so we can factor again. So, this 3x plus 4 is here for one of my factors

14
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:08,985
and 2y minus 3z is my other factor. And again, this line should make sense

15
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:14,385
because if we distribute 2y, we'll get 2y times 3x plus 4, our first term. And

16
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:19,953
then if we distribute negative 3z, we'll have negative 3z times 3x plus 4, our

17
00:01:19,953 --> 00:01:23,984
second term. So, this is our last finaled factored form.
