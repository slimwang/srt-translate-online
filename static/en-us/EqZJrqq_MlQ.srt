00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,080
So, let's see if we can do
some MSI protocol transitions.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,270
Let's say we have two cores
with private caches and

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,380
that the caches are using
MSI to maintain coherence.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,410
Initially, block X is in memory and
no cache has it.

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:21,280
So here are the actions of
the caches in C1 and C2's cache.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,840
Core 1 issues a read X.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,040
Meanwhile, core 2 doesn't do anything.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:32,540
What is the state of block X in C1's
cache after this read is completed?

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:38,600
And what is the state of
the block x in C2's cache,

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,540
after this read on C1 is completed?

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,590
So put your MS or I state here and
another one here.

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:53,590
Now, lets say that the next axis is
that C2 read X after this is completed,

13
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,200
what is the new state of X in C1 and
C2's cache?

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,100
And finally C1 does
another axis write X,

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,880
what is now the state in C1's cache
after this write is complete?

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,720
And what's the state in C2's cache
after this write on C1 is complete
