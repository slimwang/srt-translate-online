1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:06,342
3 times 10 to the 6th is three million, and 6 times 10 to the 4th is 60,000. So

2
00:00:06,342 --> 00:00:12,280
adding these together, we would get 3,060,000. Written in scientific notation,

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,813
that is, 3.06 times 10 to the 6th. So what can you learn from this? Well you

4
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:22,880
can't add things that have different powers of ten. That's like saying $400

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,641
plus $30 equals $700. That would be really great if I was being paid that. But

6
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:31,824
it would also be pretty horrible if you were shopping and all of a sudden

7
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:37,486
everything cost a ton of money. Luckily, this is not actually an equality. We

8
00:00:37,486 --> 00:00:40,170
need to be careful about when we are adding numbers that are in scientific

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,269
notation.
