1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,790
Okay Michael, so here's this theorem that

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,340
you, you so desperately wanted. You ready?

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,130
>> Yep.

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,905
>> I'm going to read it to you, because you can't read. In a two player

5
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:15,500
zero-sum deterministic game of perfect information, minimax equals maximin.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,380
>> Alright you told us what minimax was,

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,640
but you didn't tell us what maximin was.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,270
>> Well maximin is like minimax, except the

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,834
other way around. So a is trying to. [LAUGH]

10
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:25,350
>> You know, one side is trying to minimize

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,430
the maximum, the other side is trying to maximize the minimum.

12
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:27,540
>> Okay.

13
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,920
>> It's exactly what we described before, just depends upon whether you're

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,790
looking at it from a's point of view or b's point of view.

15
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,640
>> Oh, I see, like, which, do you choose

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,440
a column first or do you choose a row first?

17
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,200
>> Exactly, so whether you go a first followed by b,

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,780
or b first followed by a. You're end, going to end up

19
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,180
in the same, with the same result. And that, more importantly,

20
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,390
or at least as important, there always exists an optimal pure

21
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,360
strategy for each player. In other words, you can solve those

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,980
games and you know what the answer is. Once you write down

23
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,280
the matrix. You just do Minimax, or you do Maximin and you

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,160
end up with the proper answer. And now you know what the

25
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,820
optimal players would do. Now there is a subtlety here which

26
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,020
I got it a little bit in the previous slide, when I

27
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,500
talked about rational agents. And what we're sort of assuming in everything

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,840
that we discuss here is that people are always trying to maximize

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,500
their rewards, okay? So we define the, the

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,690
reinforcement learning problem that way. That my goal is

31
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,170
to find a policy that maximizes my long

32
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,520
term expected reward. You know so I'm trying to

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,680
find, to get the best reward that I

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,160
can. And what you're assuming here is that everyone

35
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,060
else is doing the same thing and they're

36
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,440
assuming that everyone else is doing the same thing.

37
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:34,990
>> Okay.

38
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,180
>> DOes that make sense?

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,300
>> It does thought I'm a little bit stuck on this

40
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,920
word optimal at the moment. Right. Well, that's what I'm trying

41
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,200
to get at actually. That optimal here really means I'm

42
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,850
maximizing the reward that I can get, and I'm assuming everyone

43
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,100
else is doing the same thing. And I'm, furthermore, I'm assuming

44
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,960
that they're assuming that everyone else is doing the same thing.

45
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,850
>> So, so I guess I'm wondering whether. Whether this theroem is

46
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,650
vaccus in a sense that are we defining optimal to be mini max.

47
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,880
>> What we're defining optimal to be, I think.

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,720
So that's a good questino. I think I would unroll the vaccus one level by saying

49
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,580
this. Optimal here, basically has to be optimal

50
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,100
in respect to what? And the respect of

51
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,130
what here is the underlying assumption that everyone

52
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,090
is trying to maximize their rewards. And that

53
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,980
everyone knows this. So, in a world where

54
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,920
you have perfect information. It's zero-sum. Then, the strategy

55
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,880
of Minimax and Maximin give you the same answer.

56
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,660
And that furthermore there is always some place where the

57
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,440
column and the row cross, the best column and the

58
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,960
best row cross. And that is always going to be

59
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,730
the solution to that particular game. Now, if we weren't

60
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,190
in a two-player zero-sum deterministic game of perfect information, that

61
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,660
might not be the case. But in a case where

62
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,410
we're in this sort of simplest version, where everyone's being.

63
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,600
Rational, that is, optimal, that is, trying to maximize their, their

64
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,830
own reward. And assuming everyone else is maximizing their own reward, this

65
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,260
is the right thing to do. Now, I've got a little

66
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,030
weasel word here as well which we're going to get to in

67
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,490
a moment which is this notion not just of a strategy

68
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,600
but of a pure strategy. [INAUDIBLE] There's a reason why we have

69
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,480
notions of pure strategies because in the end as we get

70
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,950
more complicated we're going to have to do it with impure strategies.

71
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,100
>> Mmm.

72
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,650
>> Okay, but are you with me so far?

73
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,720
>> I think so, yeah.

74
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,930
>> So basically all that stuff we did in AI with game trees and search

75
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,613
is kind of what you would expect people to do if they knew everything. [LAUGH]

76
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:37,630
>> So, So, I feel like I could prove this theorum in the case of trees

77
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,770
because you just prop, you just kind of

78
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,260
commute values from leaves up to the root.

79
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:42,810
>> Yeah.

80
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,220
>> And, it, it doesn't matter. There is no notion of who goes first or

81
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,280
who goes second. So there's just going to be

82
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,130
one answer, to that process. It's not obvious

83
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,890
to me, how to show it, if you, once you've. Turn the tree into a matrix, that

84
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,090
that matrix, I guess because it captures the

85
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,810
same information, it ought to be the case that

86
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,690
this is still true, but like, I'd have to kind of sit down and think it through.

87
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,320
>> No, and it's, so, so, to help you

88
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,730
think it through, I guess what I would suggest is

89
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,700
if you have the matrix, you can create a

90
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,370
tree that's consistent with it. Because every row and every

91
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,410
column represents a strategy. You don't know what

92
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,029
that strategy is, but you can, since it's

93
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,880
a finite matrix. You can construct a tree

94
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,630
that is consistant with that major. In fact, possibly

95
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,860
an infinate number of them, I'm not sure,

96
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,020
but you can certainly construct at least one that

97
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,540
is consistent with it. And then once you

98
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,732
have the tree you just do what you said.

99
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:29,232
>> Good.

100
00:04:29,232 --> 00:04:30,840
>> Alright, good. So we've got this

101
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,760
fundamental result and now what we're going to

102
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,710
do is we're going to try to be a bit more interesting. But it

103
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,390
is important to go through this because now we've

104
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,042
got some basic vocabulary and some basic building blocks okay?

105
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:41,880
>> Yep.

106
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,178
>> Alright.
