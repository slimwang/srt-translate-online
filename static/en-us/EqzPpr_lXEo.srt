1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,150
When you want to create a fresh
libGDX Project, you can actually use

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,450
the super-convenient libGDX
Project Setup utility.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,690
We actually included it at
the root of the course code.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,430
It's called gdx-setup.jar.

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,330
If you want to download the setup app
for yourself, you can just search for

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,850
libgdx.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,120
This first result's the one you want.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,890
Select Download and
select Download Setup App.

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,080
If you get this alert saying that
gdx-setup can't be opened because it's

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,550
buy an unidentified developer,
you can fix that by opening up your

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,000
System Preferences,
going to Security and Privacy,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,970
and checking the radio button for
Allow apps downloaded from Anywhere.

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,200
Now the setup app needs some information
to configure our new project.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,470
We'll give it the name Icicles.

15
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,400
We use the package
com.udacity.gamedev.icicles.

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,275
We'll name the game class IciclesGame.

17
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,250
Destination is where the project setup
utility will crate your new project,

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,070
we'll just say Desktop/Icicles.

19
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,989
Next, the project set up
utility needs the path of

20
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,450
your Android software development kit.

21
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,320
If you don't remember where that is
you can open up the Preferences pane

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,930
of Android Studio, search for

23
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,460
sdk and then up in this box here
you'll find the path of your SDK.

24
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,650
We'll just copy that and we'll paste it
into the libGDX Project Setup utility.

25
00:01:22,765 --> 00:01:25,975
Next you can select what version
of libGDX you'd like to use.

26
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:28,620
You'll almost always just
want to use the most recent.

27
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,920
Then you need to decide what
subprojects you want to include.

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,720
Unless you're using some particular
extension that doesn't support

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,970
all the different subprojects, you
should probably just include them all.

30
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,650
It's much easier to remove a platform
you don't plan to support later,

31
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,010
than it is to add in a new platform.

32
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Finally, you can include
various extensions.

33
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,660
Box2D is included by default.

34
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,410
It's a super powerful
2D physics engine and

35
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,130
we'll end up using
that in a later course.

36
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,090
But uncheck that for now.

37
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,214
Finally, hit Generate.

38
00:01:57,214 --> 00:02:00,260
42 seconds later,
we have a successful build.

39
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,460
Let's go load up our new project.

40
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,730
As usual, we open up Android Studio and
select Import Project.

41
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,690
We can hit this button
to jump to the desktop.

42
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,500
Here's the Icicles
folder we just created.

43
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,360
Now it looks like we're all loaded up.

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,090
Let's open up the Terminal.

45
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,314
And we can run the desktop run
task to see what we've got.

46
00:02:19,314 --> 00:02:22,830
[LAUGH] All right, looks like
the default project just comes with

47
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,090
a red background and
the Bad Logic Games logo.

48
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,630
Awesome, now you can create
whatever new projects you want and

49
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,700
you don't have to rely on our starter
code in the course repository.
