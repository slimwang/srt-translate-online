00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,620
Alright, so now that we have a handle on this

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,000
kind of representation, let's look at some things we can do

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,208
with it. So, here's an example of a Bayesian network

4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:11,280
with five variables. A, B, C, D, E. And let's pretend

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,150
that each one has some set of possible values. Could

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,090
be true/false. Could be red, green, blue. Whatever it happens to

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,770
be. And these arrows again tell us about our conditional dependence

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,570
relationships. So how would we go about actually well, say sampling

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,960
from this distribution? So let's say that we wanted to just

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,190
as an example see what A, B, C, D, and E, might

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,510
look like in a, in a randomly selected example from the

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,100
distribution that this network represents. So turns out what we can do

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,860
is that if we sample from A. Now A is specified

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,410
has no incoming arrows so it's not conditioned on anything in particular

15
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,645
so we can sample directly from A's distribution. We can do

16
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:50,629
the same for B and now C. If we want to sample

17
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:54,389
from C, we need to, make use of what values have already

18
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:58,190
been selected for A and B. Because C is conditioned on A

19
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,110
and B. But we can sample from that distribution. Each, each value

20
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,430
of A and B, each joint value of A and B gives

21
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,260
a distribution over C. And we do the same thing for D

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,540
and the same thing for E. And we're done. What we've sampled

23
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,820
from is actually the probability distribution,

24
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,330
the joint probability distribution. So does

25
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,110
that seem like a useful thing to be able to do Charles?

26
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,590
>> It does seem like a useful thing to be able to do.

27
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,138
>> Yeah, so here's just a quickie quiz. So just write

28
00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:24,558
a one word description that says, well in this sampling you'll notice

29
00:01:24,558 --> 00:01:27,500
I went a, b, c, d, and e. What ordering do

30
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,380
I need to do if I have a belief net like this

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,420
specified by this graphical structure with the arrows? If I want

32
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,150
to be able to sample it, I need to do it in

33
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,190
a particular order. Some orders are, are going to be problematic because

34
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,730
we haven't actually, you know, sampled the variables that it depends on.

35
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:46,180
So, what ordering should we select for A, B, C, D, E? In general, what, what is

36
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,790
the name for that. So that we can

37
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,620
actually do this kind of sampling trick this way.

38
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,200
>> Okay.
