1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
Would it be the total number of Web users?

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,160
Well, for an Android game, they're not on the Web.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,100
They might hear about it on the Web,

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,180
but that's not really gonna help you understand the served available market.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,600
Is is the total number of mobile phone users?

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,870
Well, that might be the total available market,

7
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,430
but you're really interested in just the Android piece

8
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,800
and so number 3 might make sense,

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,760
the total number of active Android users.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,340
But if we get a little more sophisticated,

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,950
we'd understand that the real answer is number 4;

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,460
it's not only the total number of active Android users,

13
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,290
but they need the right level of the operating system

14
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,620
to support the particular game's features,

15
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,020
and so you really want to get the SAM

16
00:00:36,020 --> 99:59:59,999
as tightly defined as you can.
