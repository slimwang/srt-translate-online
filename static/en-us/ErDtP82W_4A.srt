1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,540
To give you an example of how we set up
a Kaggle competition,

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,490
I'm going to start off with a
really simple use case. Let's say that

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,750
someone comes to us, and says, I want to
predict the sales price of a home.

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,820
I have that price the home sold for, as
well as a couple features describing it.

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,109
I have its location,

6
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:28,660
I have the number of bathrooms, I have
the number of bedrooms it has, I have the

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:34,690
square footage, and I have
whether or not it's an apartment or

8
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,480
condo unit or it's a home.

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,260
Let's say that asset had 10,000 rows in it,

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,010
we take those 10,000 rows and the first
thing that we do, is we split it up into

11
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,090
a training set and a test set. Value
seventy percent of the data, seven

12
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,620
thousand rows for the training set. And
three thousand rows for the test set.

13
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,420
We'll then release the training set in
its entirety, so both things like the

14
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,809
number of bedrooms as well as the sales
price to our community.  

15
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:05,379
So our community can use their seven
thousand examples to learn the relation

16
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,710
between the size of a home and the sales
price of the home.

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,450
Well then I also release everything
on the test set, except for the sales

18
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,660
price. So I'll release the number of
bedrooms the home had and their location.

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,740
We'll not tell our community the sales
price of the homes for that test that

20
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,610
they then take the lessons that they
learned in the relation between the

21
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,320
number of bedrooms in the sales price,

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,670
the relation between the location of the
sales price etc on the training set, and

23
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,210
apply that to the test set, make
predictions for the sales price on the

24
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,640
test set and send us those predictions.

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,560
We then take the predictions they sent
us, and compare those and calculate the

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,580
differences between those predictions
and the solution to the test set so the

27
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,430
actual sales price of those three
thousand homes.

28
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,930
We then compute two scores from that, we
can be at a private leaderboard score

29
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,790
based on about 2,500 of those homes that
we use for file scoring and evaluation

30
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,620
that we do not show the participant
until the end of the competition. And we

31
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,120
compute public leader board score, based
in about 500 of those homes that we show

32
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,019
immediately to the participant on a
real-time leaderboard, that not only

33
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:14,050
shows them their own score, but also
compares how they did

34
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:19,030
with every other people person who
submitted so far in that competition. And

35
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,610
that's real timely reward, that enables
people to go back

36
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,360
think about the prom again, try making
improvement, submit again, to validate whether

37
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,600
or not it was actually an improvement.
And then see how other people have

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
improved along with them.

39
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,250
The domain name was available.

40
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,300
>> Who came up with the name? >> Anthony.

41
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:48,630
>> OK. >> He wrote a script that search for a
lot of phonetically similar domain names

42
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,260
that were available or phonetically
reasonable to me, names that were available.
