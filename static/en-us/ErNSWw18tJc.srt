00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
As a final question, I will now tell you that in a different election

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
where the same pie chart is correct we had a total of 240,000 voters,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which is the sum of all votes cast.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Assuming that this pie chart here is correct, can you tell me how many votes

5
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
are cast for each of the parties?
