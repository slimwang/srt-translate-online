1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,700
Now, throughout this class, we've been
giving you sample code to work on.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,130
Now I've got a little
interesting opportunity for you.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,300
Now it's your turn to apply what
you've learned to your own apps.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,600
So your final mission is to profile
your app using battery historian.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,360
In number one, go ahead and identify
opportunities to use the JobScheduler.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,380
For example, look for
inefficient wake lock and

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,772
network access that you can reduce.

8
00:00:18,772 --> 00:00:22,330
Number two, go ahead and
generate a report and battery string and

9
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,640
take a screenshot.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,555
Make sure to keep your
raw HTML file as well.

11
00:00:25,555 --> 00:00:28,740
Third, go ahead and make improvements
to areas in your code that you've

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,390
identified as potentially inefficient or
problematic.

13
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,460
Number four, go ahead and
re-profile your code, then go ahead and

14
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,240
generate a new report in battery
storing and take a new screenshot.

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,790
And then when you're done, go ahead and

16
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,840
share the before and
after screenshots on the forum,

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,040
and then call out any specific
improvements that you see in your graph.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,500
Or if you don't see any real clear
difference in the before and

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,440
after screenshots,
post us to why this might be the case.

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,180
We'll be checking
the forums periodically and

21
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,900
we want to see what
you guys come up with.

22
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,510
All right, cool, so this wraps up our
course and I want to thank you for

23
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,890
all your hard work, it's certainly
been a pleasure to come along and

24
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,680
assist in your journey.

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,900
I hope you learned to always
apply performance mind set,

26
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,490
when writing your code and
maybe hope you had a little fun too.

27
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,459
Take care and we'll see you soon.
