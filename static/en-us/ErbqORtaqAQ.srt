1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,240
Now that you have a different
set of pitches ready,

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,210
you need to get out there and
practice them.

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,580
When you talk to a few people, make
sure that you ask for some feedback.

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,460
Ask them what they took
away from your pitch.

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,800
If you say lead,
do they hear spearheading?

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,450
If you say full service,
do they hear holistic?

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,890
Is this what you were even
hoping to get out of it?

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,310
If not,
then you need to revise your story and

9
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,560
make sure that they
receive the right message.

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,650
Taking this feedback seriously
is the best chance you have

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,360
to continue building a better story for
your business.
