00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,960
This is exactly what you did in Lesson 7, when you found where a sample mean

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,994
falls on the distribution of sample means. And then you used the z table to

3
00:00:08,994 --> 00:00:14,204
find the probability that you'll select a sample mean greater than that value.

4
00:00:14,204 --> 00:00:18,511
If you look in the z table for this z-score value, 2.44, you'll see that a

5
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:26,240
proportion of 0.9927 is less than that z-score. That means the proportion

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:34,760
greater than 2.44 is 1 minus 0.9927, which is 0.0073. If our sample mean falls

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,420
within the critical region, we then conclude that this mean comes from an

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,830
entirely different distribution. In other words, the treated population.

9
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,110
Another way to put it is that we believe that our treatment had an effect. Of

10
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,495
course, it is possible that we made a decision error. In other words, it's

11
00:00:52,495 --> 00:00:56,330
possible that we should have kept the null hypotheses, that there is no

12
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,490
significant difference, and that the only reason we got this sample mean was

13
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,129
due to chance, because there's a 0.0073% chance that we get at least this

14
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:11,720
sample mean. However, the chances are small, less than our alpha level.

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,572
Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis. But again, we don't need to find the

16
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:21,102
probability of obtaining at least the sample mean. All we need to know is that

17
00:01:21,102 --> 00:01:25,392
the z-score of the of the sample mean is greater than the z-critical value.

18
00:01:25,392 --> 00:01:31,714
2.44 is greater than 1.96. That alone tells us that our sample mean landed in

19
00:01:31,714 --> 00:01:35,930
the critical region and then we can reject the null.
