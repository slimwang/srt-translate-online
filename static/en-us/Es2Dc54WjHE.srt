00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,810
So far we have looked at simple mathematical operations of trying to

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,220
do point processes across images or looking at neighborhoods of images or

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,870
neighborhoods of pixels to be able to do simple mathematics on it.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,720
Now let's try to create a formal mathematical representation of it.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,670
For that purpose,

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,540
I'm going to introduce the concept of cross-correlation leading up to

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,620
the concept of convolution.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,090
These will provide us with simple mathematical formulations and

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,930
mathematical tools that will allow us to do things like smoothing images,

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,550
kind of doing blurring on images, and

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,060
also reducing noise and finding different types of information from images.
