1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,410
You should have a better grasp on how to
use the material design guidelines to

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,360
make your app designs more immersive,
more bold, and more graphic.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,310
>> We began the lesson with
a brief discussion of the Gestalt

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,950
principle of grouping.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,320
We used it to add space to our designs,
and make them more easily scannable and

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,370
more quickly comprehensible.

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,940
>> Next was a discussion of color,
and how to create a color palette for

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,790
a brand and apply it to an app.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,310
Then we discussed typography, and

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,530
how a clear hierarchy in type imbues
meaning into your user interface.

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,930
>> Last, we talked about imagery,
and learned how to pick photos and

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,440
illustrations that
are relevant to our users,

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,170
provided important information,
and were a delight to see.

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,820
>> Stay tuned for the next lesson,

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,770
where we'll talk about choreographing
the movement of digital paper and

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,060
ink through this concept
we call meaningful motion.
