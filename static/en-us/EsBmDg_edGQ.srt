00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,650
In CSS, you first write what's called a selector.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,750
And this defines what elements of the page a particular style will apply to.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,660
You can select an HTML tag and that rule will apply to all tags on the page.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,950
And if, for example, you want to apply style to all paragraphs on a page,

5
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,380
you can do so by writing the following.

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,190
Another way to do so is to select elements by class.

7
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,700
And this is what we did in our previous example.

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,750
So, if we want to write a style that applies to the class description,

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,260
we do so by typing dot description, and

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:44,050
inside brackets, you write the style in the form attribute colon value.

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:50,330
So for example, we can say attribute color is value red.

12
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,510
You can also combine selectors.

13
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,660
So, for example,

14
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,700
you can select all links that're inside an element with the class article.

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,140
There are links to the instructor notes for more information on this.

16
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,310
Now, earlier we said that red wasn't really the best color, but

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,800
what if we wanted to learn more about colors and how to define them?

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,610
Logically, we could say, instead of typing red,

19
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,730
I might want to type blue or black, or any other color.

20
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,600
But what if I want to get more specific?

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,730
There's got to be a way to do that, right?

22
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,720
Of course, there is.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,870
I mean, CSS has a lot of functionality, and it's impossible and unnecessary to

24
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:34,430
go into every detail right now and memorize all possible attributes and values.

25
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,450
I mean, you probably fell asleep at your computer, right now,

26
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,160
and none of us want that.

27
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,220
Instead, you should get comfortable referencing the CSS documentation.

28
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,880
We've included a link in the instructor notes.

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,180
In exploring the page,

30
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,130
you'll see that there are a lot of attributes that you can use.

31
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:56,520
For example, going back to our color reference, we can search for color.

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,350
Scrolling through the documentation,

33
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,700
you'll find examples of different ways you can define colors.

34
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,980
You can find the color red we used before.

35
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,889
You could also call rgb colors.

36
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,880
Here you'll find the color red example we used earlier.

37
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,870
You could also call hexadecimal colors or even rgb.

38
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,690
Going back to the documentation,

39
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,820
let's do a small exploration into font properties.

40
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,170
Search on the page for the font-style attribute.

41
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,590
Then answer the following question.

42
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:36,520
Which of the following are possible values for the font-style property?

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,600
Is italic a possible value?

44
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,840
What about bold or normal?

45
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,730
Is that a possible value?

46
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,520
What about standard?

47
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,420
Also, which property would you use to make the text look bold?
