1
00:00:00,246 --> 00:00:03,090
So what I really love about being a data scientist,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,480
is I love that I can use data to help

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,550
these software companies out. And the reason I love that

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,710
is because at the software companies you're able to [UNKNOWN]

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,540
help build systems that scaled a hundreds of millions of

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,750
users, that can have an enormous impact on the world.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,410
And I really love that you can bring quantitative reasoning

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,190
and quantitative thinking to help out all of the users.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,010
I love the impact.
