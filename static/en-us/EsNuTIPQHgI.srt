00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,210
Here's an example of a web form.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,900
A user enters his name and password.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,790
The password is sent in encrypted
hash form to the web server, and

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,690
the web server needs to retrieve the
user's password hash from the database

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,219
and compare and authenticate the user.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,590
The web server issues a SQL
query to the database, so

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,510
this is the example of normal usage.
