1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:06,012
Psilocybin is a naturally occurring tryptamine alkaloid. It's the principal

2
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:10,800
psychoactive component of so-called magic mushrooms, psilocybe genus of

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,930
mushrooms. About 100 species of those mushrooms had been identified, and

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,550
they've been used for, literally for thousands of years within some cultures,

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:29,686
for structured manners and for divinatory and religious purposes. So, recently,

6
00:00:29,686 --> 00:00:35,406
research has been reinitiated with psilocybin as a classic hallucinogen and

7
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:43,810
exploring some of its potential for therapeutic application. And this work

8
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,150
points back to research done in the 1950s and 60s for two different kinds of

9
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:55,258
indications. One was in cancer patients, primarily terminally ill and the other

10
00:00:55,258 --> 00:01:01,867
was in addictions area, primarily alcoholism. And we currently have studies in

11
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:07,860
both those areas going on at Johns Hopkins. So, in the cancer patients, we're

12
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,060
investigating the effects of a single psilocybin session on the existential

13
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,180
anxiety or depressed mood that some patients experience as a consequence of

14
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:26,585
their cancer diagnosis. So, as you may appreciate any terminal diagnosis can be

15
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:33,169
very psychologically disruptive. And a fairly good percentage of people

16
00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:38,911
confronted with such a diagnosis, really end up, in despair and and reduced

17
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:47,546
quality of life. We bring those individual in. They're very carefully screened

18
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:54,138
prior to participation. And if they qualify for the, for the study, then we'd

19
00:01:54,138 --> 00:01:59,728
give them an opportunity to have a guided and supported psilocybin session in

20
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:08,352
our laboratory. The context is that people lay down on a couch, they had

21
00:02:08,352 --> 00:02:15,304
headphones and eye shades. They're asked to turn their attention in on their

22
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:22,303
inner experience. They're in the presence of two guides or monitors with whom

23
00:02:22,303 --> 00:02:30,676
they've already developed a secure and supportive relationship. And those

24
00:02:30,676 --> 00:02:34,768
people are there for the eight-hour session just to provide a context of safety

25
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:41,655
and support. Under these conditions, with very high probability as we've seen

26
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:46,814
in both cancer patients and other studies that we've run in healthy volunteers,

27
00:02:46,814 --> 00:02:51,434
the majority of people have what we call a transcendent or mystical type

28
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:59,881
experience. These are experiences that have actually been well-characterized in

29
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:06,676
the general research literature on religion, they occur naturally. And they're

30
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:12,127
transformative and that they can alter very dramatically someone's entire sense

31
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:19,340
of self and attitudes towards life and meaning. The characteristics of these

32
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,380
experiences include a sense of unity or a sense of the interconnectedness of

33
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:31,304
all people and things. A sense of sacredness, reverence noetic sense that there

34
00:03:31,304 --> 00:03:35,208
is something more true and more real about this experience than every day

35
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:41,929
waking consciousness. A positive mood often accompanies these experiences,

36
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:49,088
often experienced a deep gratitude or sometimes universal love. A transcendence

37
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:55,822
of time and space occurs, the time collapses into the present moment. There's

38
00:03:55,822 --> 00:04:02,050
no past, there's no future, it's being this now. Finally, these experiences are

39
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:06,708
said to be ineffable. People, the first thing they say about this kind of

40
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:11,627
experience is, you know, I can't even put it into words. But with these kinds

41
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:17,390
of experiences come, can come great psychological healing. There's been one

42
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:23,225
recent published pilot study out of UCLA. We have this trial going at Johns

43
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:28,837
Hopkins currently. NYU also has a cancer trial going, and we're really quite

44
00:04:28,837 --> 00:04:33,853
hopeful that very systematic application of psilocybin in this context could

45
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:38,793
transform end of life care, not only for cancer patients but ultimately for us

46
00:04:38,793 --> 00:04:42,015
all.

47
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:46,367
>> For the cancer patients, did they report it helping their relationship with

48
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:50,719
their family or do their families report that the person was ready to pass on,

49
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:55,425
or was there any family input on that?

50
00:04:55,425 --> 00:05:00,097
>> Yeah, so with the cancer patients, one of the really interesting outcomes is

51
00:05:00,097 --> 00:05:07,526
their relationship to family and their caregivers. People come through these

52
00:05:07,526 --> 00:05:11,558
kinds of experiences with a altered core sense of self and their beingness in

53
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:18,034
the world. It gives them deep inner strength. And what's really remarkable and

54
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:24,274
touching is when then that deep inner strength is communicated to their

55
00:05:24,274 --> 00:05:32,950
caretakers. So people can come through this kind of experience and, and be able

56
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:40,565
to say, clear-eyed, and emotionally open, you know? I'm dying and, and it's sad

57
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:45,429
and I, I am upset to be leaving and, and leaving you, but it's also okay, and

58
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:50,141
there, and there's something beautiful about this and there's something

59
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:56,246
absolutely okay, and I want you to know that.

60
00:05:56,246 --> 00:05:58,222
>> Right. >> And [LAUGH]

61
00:05:58,222 --> 00:06:03,649
and when that's, it actually gets to me just describing it. But, but when

62
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:09,021
someone can say that to their loved ones, it has remarkable healing direction

63
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:11,190
both ways.

64
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,120
>> I can imagine.
