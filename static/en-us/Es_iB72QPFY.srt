00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,260
So there are many ways you could improve this form. One of

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,800
the ideas you might have had as to improve the visual design

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,490
of the theme of the form, to make it look a little

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,590
bit more Android-y. Another thing we could of done is maybe making

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,570
the fonts a bit bigger, making the spacing a little bit wider,

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,080
just to make the form kind of flow better. Another idea would be

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,460
to validate the form, so the user knows what to type in

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,678
if they got something wrong. Nazmul, do you have any thoughts on this?

9
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:25,840
>> Yeah actually, if I were to answer this

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,460
questions like six, seven, or even eight years ago when I

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,360
had my start up, I actually would completely agree with everything

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,790
you said. I probably, like you, created this really awesome sign

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,070
in form. But the correct answer is actually not to have

14
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,130
one. The most important thing to do in this situation is

15
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,930
to remove this form in it's entirety. And replace it with

16
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,270
Sign In with Google or Sign In with Facebook or Sign

17
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,510
In with LinkedIn, who, or whoever your favorite social identity provider is.

18
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,780
There's no reason to subject your user to having to

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,820
fill out all these long forms when all they want to do

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,420
is use your application. That's like the worst time to

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,390
actually bring this up. Instead by removing this entire flow and

22
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,490
having a single button that they can use to sign

23
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,470
in, it makes their life easy. And it also makes your

24
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,510
life easy, because you can now get out of the username

25
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,600
and password business. And use social identity providers who provide the

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,410
service for free, reducing the amount of work you have to do and

27
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,710
also what your user has to do in order to use your application
