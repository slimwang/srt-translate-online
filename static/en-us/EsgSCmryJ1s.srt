1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,790
All right, you're done.

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,350
I'll show you what I did.

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,450
All right, so the first thing we did
was update our list item forecast

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,520
to have left and right extra padding.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,090
We added a dimension file for
sw600dp portrait.

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,090
Note, we can have I've really,
really wide padding there,

7
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,640
because remember tablets
are just huge in that direction.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,188
SW720dp is even wider, but

9
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:23,880
we're not actually going to
increase the padding at all.

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,340
So we also took the grid layout
of the fragment detail and

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,290
moved it as a detail extras grid.

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,930
That's pretty easy because well,
we just literally moved it.

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,100
All we needed to do was make sure that
we added these name spaces in correctly.

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,190
Under Refs, we've now created this
fragment detail start layout reference,

15
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:42,980
which is pretty cool.

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,010
We've created it for
every single size and orientation.

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,130
It's always pointing to the right one.

18
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,240
Now we use this layout inside a detail
fragment rather than referencing

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,850
the layout by name.
