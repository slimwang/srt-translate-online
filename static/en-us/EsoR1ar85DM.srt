1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well, the answer is that changing hand_rank wouldn't help anything

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
because it really is a tie, and hand_rank really does return the same value.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If we both have straight flushes ace high,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
hand_rank should return exactly the same thing for both.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Just because we have different suits doesn't mean they should have a different hand_rank.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But we could change poker to return

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
a list of everybody that tied rather than arbitrarily choose one of them.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Or we could invent a new function, say,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
we might want the function "poker<u>with</u>ties."

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So either of those would be okay.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I think the best is not to introduce this new function

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
because once we have that, who would really want the poker function?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who would want to say "Let's play a game of poker

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
where we don't do ties correctly?"

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I think we really want to handle ties correctly,

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
so I think that's the best approach of the 3,

17
00:00:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but either approach would do.
