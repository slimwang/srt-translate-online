00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,105
This problem was a little harder than the others. If you wrote ns or no

2
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:08,470
solution, that's great. Let's see why the answer is no solution. When I'm

3
00:00:08,482 --> 00:00:13,005
solving an absolute value inequality, the first thing I need to do is make sure

4
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:17,345
I isolate the absolute value. To isolate the absolute value, in this case, I

5
00:00:17,357 --> 00:00:22,215
have to divide both sides by negative 3. To isolate the absolute value, I have

6
00:00:22,227 --> 00:00:27,017
to divide both sides of the inequality by negative 3. When I divide the left

7
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:32,036
side by negative 3, negative 3 over negative 3 is 1, so I'm simply left with the

8
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:36,650
absolute of x minus 4. Now, since I divided both sides of this equation by

9
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:42,280
negative 3, we have to remember to switch the direction of the inequality. And 6

10
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:47,825
divided by negative 3 is negative 2. Now, let's think about this problem. The

11
00:00:47,837 --> 00:00:53,025
absolute value of x minus 4 is less than negative 2. We know that absolute

12
00:00:53,037 --> 00:00:58,511
values are always positive so can the absolute value of x minus 4 ever be a

13
00:00:58,523 --> 00:01:03,928
negative number or much less, less that negative 2? No, this can never happen.

14
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:09,607
Since the absolute value can never be negative, this inequality has no solution.

15
00:01:09,722 --> 00:01:13,935
Let's go on to Chapter 3, where we're going to learn about lines.
