00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,692
If we insert a value of 7 for x in our equation, we end up with a value of 5 for

2
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:09,390
y. This is perfectly in light of what we would expect, considering we have a

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,408
0.57 on our parabola that we're looking at. However, let's think about what this

4
00:00:14,408 --> 00:00:19,017
means. We just said that the smallest value we could get for the quantity x

5
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:23,813
minus 7 squared was zero. We got that by plugging in 7 for x. We're finding a y

6
00:00:23,813 --> 00:00:28,104
value here based on an x value. So the x value that we pick minimizes an

7
00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:32,722
expression that's helping to determine the y value. And the y value is going to

8
00:00:32,722 --> 00:00:36,579
be as small as it can be. Which, as we can see, is true of the point that we

9
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:40,280
just graphed, since it's the vertex of this upward facing parabola.
