1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,096
Since we know that Grant wants his profit to be at least $20,000 and p stands

2
00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:10,482
for profit in dollars. We know that p has to be greater than or equal to 20,000.

3
00:00:10,482 --> 00:00:15,031
Now we just have a simple case of substitution, p is equal to this entire

4
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:20,575
quantity, 75m minus 5,000. So you replace p here in the inequality with that

5
00:00:20,575 --> 00:00:27,032
quantity. So here is our final answer. 75m minus 5,000 is greater than or equal

6
00:00:27,032 --> 00:00:27,943
to 20,000.
