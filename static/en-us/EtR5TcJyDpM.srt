00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,960
I'm here with Aaron Harris,
a partner at Y-Combinator,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,698
one of the best accelerators
around the world.

3
00:00:05,698 --> 00:00:10,180
Before joining Y-Combinator,
Aaron was founder of Tutorspree,

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,060
an online service that
connected tutors and students.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,240
Thank you for joining us.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,170
>> My pleasure, thanks for having me.

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,230
>> So
let's start with a personal question.

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,740
How did you come up with the idea for
Tutorspree?

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,680
Well, it was actually initially
my co-founder Josh's idea.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,410
He had this thought that we were
going to build an online platform for

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,770
people to buy and sell their time, and
that kind of lent itself to tutoring.

12
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,662
And the first way he
pitched it to me was,

13
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:38,820
it's this online platform that
will buy and sell time in any way.

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,400
I said, that's a stupid idea, because
it just sounded too broad and general.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,720
As we started thinking about it,
the thing we realized

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,260
was that tutoring was kind of a perfect
fit for what we were talking about.

17
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,710
I had tutored in high school and
in college, I'd had tutors.

18
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,080
I had a lot of friends who
are professional tutors.

19
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,650
We kind of talked to
them about this idea,

20
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,450
we started uncovering these
things that they actually needed.

21
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,129
And that's what
influenced us to sort of,

22
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,720
I guess, iterate our way towards
what Tutorspree became over time.

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,830
>> You think this is common for
every founder?

24
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,030
Do funders in Y-Combinator,
this is how to do it?

25
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,560
>> It should be.

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,670
It isn't necessarily always.

27
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:23,261
Sometimes people come to us with
ideas that are kind of made up.

28
00:01:23,261 --> 00:01:25,687
We call them sometimes solutions
in search of problems,

29
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:28,567
where people just have this really
interesting technical idea that

30
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:30,450
doesn't actually relate to any problems.

31
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,740
But I think the best ideas tend
to come from problems that people

32
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,700
themselves experience.

33
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,190
So in that way I actually think
Tutorspree probably wasn't

34
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,720
the best idea we could have done.

35
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,080
I wasn't a professional tutor,
neither were my co-founders.

36
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,870
So there were things that
we didn't quite understand.

37
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,385
We also weren't parents which
was kind of our target market.

38
00:01:48,385 --> 00:01:50,800
We didn't have kids go
through the process.

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,910
So while we learned a lot through
customer conversations and

40
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,822
watching how people acted,
I think we missed things.

41
00:01:56,822 --> 00:02:00,298
>> So how do Y-Combinator
companies come up with their idea?

42
00:02:00,298 --> 00:02:05,840
>> I don't think there's any one, single
way that founders come up with the idea.

43
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,810
But there is a common thread between
the best of them, which is that people

44
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,100
are solving problems that they have,
problems that they really understand.

45
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,200
I think Dropbox is
a great example of this,

46
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,280
where Drew got annoyed of carrying
files around on a USB stick, right?

47
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,120
It's crazy, you have one on your keys.

48
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,820
It's a crazy way to carry files around
in a world where we have the Internet

49
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,900
and cloud storage.

50
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,199
Now, in 2005, 6,
2007 when he was starting this,

51
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,110
remember, this concept didn't exist.

52
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,879
When I first got my Gmail account,
I had to know the Gmail beta in 2005.

53
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:40,515
I used it as cloud storage.

54
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:41,410
I just realized this today,

55
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,480
I was thinking like when was
the first time I used cloud storage?

56
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,950
I would send copies of my thesis to
myself, right, from my Harvard address,

57
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,250
just so I had a copy somewhere
in case my computer crashed or

58
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,100
in case I needed to print it up.

59
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,830
That's such a silly thing to do.

60
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,370
Email is not designed for that.

61
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,935
But that was the only way really to do,
so

62
00:02:59,935 --> 00:03:03,780
he said I'm going to go one step
further and Dropbox was born.

63
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,946
>> Right.
And what do you look in when you look

64
00:03:05,946 --> 00:03:08,049
at applications to Y-Combinator?

65
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:10,310
What do you look in, in terms of ideas?

66
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,510
>> In terms of the idea or
the founder that we want to accept?

67
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,230
>> Yeah.

68
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,982
>> So, our thinking on this, I guess, my
thinking on this has changed over time,

69
00:03:18,982 --> 00:03:21,590
and I think the same is
true of my partners.

70
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,130
I think we used to say that founders
were the only thing that mattered.

71
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,490
Idea was important, but
mostly as an informed founders.

72
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,930
A lot of other people will tell
you it's all about the idea.

73
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,190
I think all these things
are probably too clear cut, or

74
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,130
it's not that black and white.

75
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,450
I think you need both founders and
ideas.

76
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,220
Because if you just take founders
who seem really great but

77
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,900
they don't have good ideas,
they're probably not great founders.

78
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,810
because great founders have ideas
of what they're going to work on.

79
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,040
And if you take something that just
seems like a really great idea and

80
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,180
the founders don't seem great,

81
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,690
they're probably not going to
be able to execute it.

82
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,880
So I wish I had a clean answer but
the truth is, it's both.

83
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,260
And so we're looking for founders who
seem really great and formidable.

84
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,300
And the truth is,
we're not looking necessarily for

85
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,670
the most intelligent founders,
because that's actually not the thing.

86
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,150
It's not pure horsepower.

87
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,810
It's not intellectual horsepower.

88
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,100
It's are you smart
enough to get this done?

89
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,617
But more importantly,
do you have the determination and

90
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:23,583
the drive to just go through brick
wall after brick wall to do it?

91
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,975
Because let's face it, you're going to
screw up again and again, and even if

92
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,660
you don't screw up, things aren't
going to work out the way you wanted.

93
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,202
And if you can't go through that,
you're in trouble.

94
00:04:32,202 --> 00:04:33,395
On the other hand,

95
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:37,795
if your idea is something that has
no chance of being a large business,

96
00:04:37,795 --> 00:04:42,360
It doesn't matter if you're the most
determined founder in the world.

97
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,550
It's not going to go anywhere.

98
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,050
>> Right.
