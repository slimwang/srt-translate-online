1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] And the answer is 1/3,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
as you can easily see if you call X the probability of rain in time T

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and also the probability of rain, T minus 1.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
These 2 must be equivalent because we're looking for the stationary distribution.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Then we get, by virtue of our expansion of the state at time T,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the probability of transitioning from rain to rain is 0.6,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the probability of having it rain is X again,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the probability of transitioning from sun to rain is 0.2,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and the probability of having sun before is 1 minus X,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
so we get X equals 0.4X plus 0.2.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Or, differently, we have 0.6X equals 0.2,

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and when we work this out, X is 1/3,

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
which is the probability of rain in the asymptote if you wait forever.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
One of the interesting things to observe here

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
is that the stationary distribution does not depend on the initial distribution.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
In fact, I didn't even tell you what the initial state was.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Markov chains that have that property, which are pretty much all Markov chains,

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
are called ergodic.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You can safely forget that word again, but people in the field use this word

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
to express Markov chains that mix.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And mix means that the knowledge of the initial distribution fades over time

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
until it disappears in the end.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The speed at which it gets lost is called the mixing speed.
