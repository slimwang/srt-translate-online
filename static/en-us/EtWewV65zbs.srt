1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,943
To do this, all we do is add the frequencies in each country belonging to the

2
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:12,128
different continents. There are 2 students from Canada, 3 from Mexico and 10

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,943
from the US. So if we add them, we get 15 students from North America. And

4
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:26,058
similarly, 4% are from Canada, 6% from Mexico and 20% from the US. So if we add

5
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:33,276
them, we get 30%. We have 12 students from China, 8 from India, 8 from Japan and

6
00:00:33,288 --> 00:00:40,295
1 from Pakistan. So if we add them, we get 29 students from Asia. 24 plus 16

7
00:00:40,502 --> 00:00:51,360
plus 16 plus 2 is 58. And finally, we have 2 from England, 3 from Germany and 1

8
00:00:51,372 --> 00:01:01,009
from Sweden, making 6 from Europe. 4% plus 6% plus 2% is 12%. So now we have

9
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:05,379
even more simplified data. While this is interesting and provides new

10
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:10,190
information, now we can't know how many people are from individual countries

11
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:14,956
just by looking at this table. Creating this table was convienent because it

12
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:20,090
gave us fewer categories to look at. Three categories in this case. But we lost

13
00:01:20,102 --> 00:01:24,721
information in the process. In other words, information about specific

14
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:30,016
countries. When creating frequency distribution tables, there can sometimes be a

15
00:01:30,028 --> 00:01:35,169
trade off between convenience and informativeness. But there's no one right way

16
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:39,913
of presenting the data. It all depends on what kind of question you want to

17
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:44,418
answer. In this case, if you want to know how many students are from North

18
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,923
America, organizing it like this is best. But if you want to know how many

19
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:53,922
students are from India, or other specific countries, organizing it like this is

20
00:01:53,934 --> 00:01:58,588
best. The key is to know how you're going to organize your data, based on the

21
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,642
questions that you want to answer.
