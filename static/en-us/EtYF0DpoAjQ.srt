1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,830
Port numbers distinguish
different applications and

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,220
sessions on the same host.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,110
Normally a server has a well known
port for its application, like 80 for

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,950
HTTP or 22 for SSH.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,910
A client initiates a connection and

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,370
the client end is associated with
an arbitrary port on its end.

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,510
The OS can then distinguish incoming
traffic by looking at the addresses and

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,130
port numbers on it.

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,320
And let's do some experimentation.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,160
Using Netcat,

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,913
see if you can find out what is
the highest port that you can listen on?

12
00:00:31,913 --> 00:00:39,030
Is it 100, or 9999, or 10240?

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,898
Or 65535, or 128000, or
is there no limit at all?

14
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:47,926
And then what's the lowest
port you can listen on?

15
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:52,888
Is it 1, or 100, or 512, or 1024, or

16
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:57,869
negative infinity, or is it 0.000023?
