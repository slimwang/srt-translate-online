Hi and welcome to the first
lesson of the Udacity

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,890
artificial intelligence
nanodegree program.

3
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:10,370
My name is Luis Serrano and I'm one
of the instructors here at Udacity.

4
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:13,209
Before being here I used to work
in machine learning in Google.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,219
I'm the team that generated your
YouTube video recommendations.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,211
In this lesson we'll learn two
very important concepts of

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,539
artificail intelligence,
constraint propagation and search.

8
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:26,679
We'll do this in a very fun setting
without going into too much detail

9
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:29,449
as we'll be studying these
concepts later in the course.

10
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:34,780
The setting is creating an AI agent
that will solve any Sudoku puzzle.

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,130
As you may know, a Sudoku puzzle
consists of a nine by nine grid

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,590
filled with the numbers
from one to nine.

13
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,005
The only rule that applies is,
in each row, column and three by three

14
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:50,130
sub-square, all the numbers from one
to nine should appear exactly once.

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,060
For example, here's a Sudoku puzzle and
here's its solution.

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:00,509
The goal of this lesson is to build and
code an AI agent that solves any Sudoku.

17
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:04,319
The algorithm fully used are based from
the great blog post of Peter Norvig,

18
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,540
one of these nanodegrees instructors.

19
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,390
You can find the link in
the instructor comments below.

20
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,829
At some points throughout this lesson,
I'll be doing the work.

21
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:15,769
And others, you'll be jumping
in to answer quiz questions and

22
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:18,489
to actually call some of
these functions in Python.

23
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:21,799
After the lesson, you'll complete
a project that allows you to more fully

24
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,250
develop and code a number of
extensions to the algorithm.

25
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,450
When you submit the project you'll get
a code review with feedback from one of

26
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,579
our talented reviewers.

27
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:33,239
Here is what the final
output will look like.

28
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,769
Pretty cool, right?

29
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:35,899
So, what do you say?

30
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,420
Let's get started.
