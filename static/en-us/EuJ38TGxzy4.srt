00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,416
However, even a PCP alone may not
solve a coordination problem without

2
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:06,173
some electronic assistance.

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,436
It's too complicated for that.

4
00:00:08,436 --> 00:00:13,425
Let's discuss the care coordination
situation facing the typical

5
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:17,896
PCP who sees a lot of chronic
disease patients, like Marla.

6
00:00:17,896 --> 00:00:21,661
Remember there are 14 physicians
involved in the care for

7
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:23,248
each of those patients.

8
00:00:23,248 --> 00:00:28,210
Studies have shown that there
are a total of 86 physicians involved

9
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,013
in caring for all patients like
Marla in this one PCP's practice.

10
00:00:33,013 --> 00:00:37,885
Overall, this typical
patient-centered medical

11
00:00:37,885 --> 00:00:42,650
home interacts with 229
physicians each year.
