00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,754
Alright, here goes. There are three inherited methods, set text, set answer,

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:07,872
and check answer. And you can tell because they are over here, and they're not

3
00:00:07,872 --> 00:00:12,734
over here. Because choice question extends question, it picks up all of those

4
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:17,474
methods automatically. It inherits them. Display, on the other hand, is both

5
00:00:17,474 --> 00:00:22,646
here and here. Which tells us that the choice question was not happy with this

6
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:28,620
display and provides its own. It overrides the one from the super class.

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,610
Finally, there's add choice, which wasn't over here at all, so that's an added

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,217
method that only appears in choice question, but not in question. Next, you'll

9
00:00:36,217 --> 00:00:39,084
get to implement these two methods, but the good part is, you don't have to

10
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:41,998
implement these because they are already in the question class and choice

11
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:44,850
question just inherits them.
