00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,920
Most of the remainder of this particular lesson is going to be concerned

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:09,221
with architectural styles. As with buildings, software systems come in,

3
00:00:09,221 --> 00:00:14,250
in, of different types. Okay, we call those types architectural styles. Taylor's

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,620
definition of an architectural style is a named collection of decisions.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,340
Those decisions are appropriate in a particular circumstances that is

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:31,280
dependent upon you know, the system specifications and its major concerns.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,840
The design decisions constrain, what are the possible components and

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,230
interactions and by using. The architectural style.

9
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,460
You get various benefits from it

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,800
on the ultimate system you're you're building and the process of building it.
