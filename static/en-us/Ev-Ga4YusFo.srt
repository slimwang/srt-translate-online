00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,444
There're three things we have to do. First off, we need to declare an instance

2
00:00:03,444 --> 00:00:07,455
variable to hold the choices. That's an ArrayList of Strings. In the

3
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:12,570
constructor, I initialized it with an empty ArrayList. And in the add-choice

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,230
method, I simply add the choice to the ArrayList. That was a good start, but so

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,530
far we've ignored this parameter that tells us whether that choice was correct

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,900
or not. And that's what we're going to be doing in the next stage.
