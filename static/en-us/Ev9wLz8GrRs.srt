00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We've seen errors appearing on different time scales.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The LTE, the local truncation error, that happens at each time step.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There is one more time scale that when they look into mainly what happens in the long run,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
what happens if this system runs for 1,000 years, 10,000 years for the age of the universe,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
is this solution going to explode or to implode in the long run or will it stick close to the exact solution.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The GTE for one final time does not tell us much about that form.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
One way of looking at the long-term error is for instance to look at energy.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If the systems is such that energy should be conserved, we can look at the long-term evolution

9
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of energy to learn whether there is an issue.
