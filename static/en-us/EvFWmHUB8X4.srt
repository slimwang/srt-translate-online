00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,330
To use scales in D3, you specify the range of your possible input values,

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,070
a function that transforms these to output values and

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,220
the appropriate limits on your output range.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,013
Going back to our Gapminder example, one last time, we notice that the x-axis

5
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:27,068
ranges from around 250 to 100,000, and it's a log scale.

6
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:34,120
And the y-axis ranges from around 15 to 90 on a linear scale.

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,540
To plot our circle using D3 and its scaling functions,

8
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,180
we need to remember that the expectancy is a value of 75.

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,600
The y-axis is on a linear scale.

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,801
The income per person is 8,347.

11
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:53,790
And the x-axis is on a logarithmic scale.
