1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,990
So why do we want to measure the traffic

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,260
on the network? One reason might be billing. So

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,400
for example, we might want to charge a customer

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,256
based on how much traffic they've sent on a network.

5
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:14,240
In order to do so, we need to passively

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,690
measure how much traffic that customer is sending. Here's

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,200
an example of measurements of inbound and outbound traffic

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,030
volumes. On a link on the Georgia Tech campus network.

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,000
The Y axis is shown in bits per second, and the X axis is the time of

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,360
day. Now, a user might be billed based on how much traffic they send on the

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,930
network. A common mode of billing is called

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,560
95th percentile billing, where a customer pays for

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,320
what's called a committed information rate, or CIR,

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,870
and throughput is measured every five minutes. The customer,

15
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,220
then, may be billed on the 95th percentile,

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,190
of these five minute samples. So if we were

17
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,130
to bill on the 95th percentile of inbound traffic,

18
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,230
we might approximate that 95th percentile by the orange

19
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,970
line I've drawn on here. And the customer

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,570
might be billed at this rate, even though they're

21
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,030
allowed to sometimes burst at higher rates. Another common

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,610
reason to measure is security. For example, network operators

23
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,790
may want to know the type of traffic that's

24
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,525
being sent on the network so they can detect

25
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:24,870
rogue behaviour, and network operator may want to measure

26
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,190
traffic on the network to detect compromised hosts or

27
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,006
the presence of Botnets or Denial of Sevice attacks,

28
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:35,250
two phenomena that we'll talk about later on in

29
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,820
the course. For the rest of this lesson, since

30
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,630
we focused a lot on performance measurement already, I will

31
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,010
mainly focus on passive traffic data measurement.
