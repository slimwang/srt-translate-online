1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:01,198
Tac.

2
00:00:01,198 --> 00:00:02,058
Why?

3
00:00:02,058 --> 00:00:07,040
Because dispatch_async
immediately returns.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,452
So what it does is,
it will return immediately,

5
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:16,520
and add this block to this cue.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,089
So this will run first, and
some time in the near future,

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,330
this block will run, so
it will be first tac, and then tic.
