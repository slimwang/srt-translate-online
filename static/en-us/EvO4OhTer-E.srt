1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,657
So the main steps again are in video
stabilization are estimating camera

2
00:00:04,657 --> 00:00:09,555
motion, stabilizing camera paths and
then being able to resynthize them.

3
00:00:09,555 --> 00:00:11,135
Let's look at each one of them.

4
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:14,732
So let's start off with first
step estimating camera motion.

5
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:17,642
Here we will actually talk a process
that we've looked at before.

6
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:20,908
To estimate camera motion,
we need to find features and

7
00:00:20,908 --> 00:00:24,465
then we need to take those features and
track them over time.

8
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:27,332
So, again, what we can do is we
can basically find image corners.

9
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:30,462
Remember, what we did and
we were talking about feature detection.

10
00:00:30,462 --> 00:00:34,765
Look at points that have a high gradient
in both x and y, that's a corner.

11
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:39,515
And using that corner with the fact that
we want to do is we want to track hem

12
00:00:39,515 --> 00:00:40,329
over time.

13
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:42,598
And here, you basically see
a lot of these green lines.

14
00:00:42,598 --> 00:00:46,532
Basically, these green lines are saying
is okay, this point was here in this

15
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:49,921
frame and moved to this one and
that starts, if you're noticing,

16
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:53,031
give me very good motion,
even when I'm zooming in and out.

17
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:56,325
You can see motions very
clearly going on as to where

18
00:00:56,325 --> 00:01:01,035
the different parts of the region are
changing with respect to how I'm moving.

19
00:01:01,035 --> 00:01:04,135
Or in this case,
even zooming the camera in and out.

20
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:08,556
Of course, the camera's going through
translation, some rotation and

21
00:01:08,556 --> 00:01:09,348
scale here.

22
00:01:09,348 --> 00:01:11,374
Couple of things we have
to note when we do this,

23
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:15,032
we have to start differentiating between
background motion and foreground motion.

24
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:18,744
So for example, in this case, if
you'll notice there's a car coming in.

25
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:22,262
We want to be able to differentiate
between the motion of the background

26
00:01:22,262 --> 00:01:24,535
itself and
some of the foreground elements.

27
00:01:24,535 --> 00:01:27,558
We don't want our camera to be
dominated by the car moving.

28
00:01:27,558 --> 00:01:30,683
We want to be able to lock in do
the background pixels itself, so

29
00:01:30,683 --> 00:01:33,508
we have to do a little bit of
separation of foreground and

30
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:35,088
background in this analysis.

31
00:01:35,088 --> 00:01:37,900
So we only, I want to estimate
the motion of the background,

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,220
because that's the one
we want to stabilize on.

33
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,234
And we want to basically be able to kind
of create some sort of way to separate

34
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:45,529
out the foreground by,

35
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:48,920
with the background by giving
more weight to the background.
