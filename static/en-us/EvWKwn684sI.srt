1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,310
So let's look at another feature that is needed

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,570
to build scalable applications, task queues. So why do

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,370
we need task queues? Well at this time this

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,080
picture should be no surprise to you. Our dear

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,500
users accessing our application from various devices. And our

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,330
application for turning the response. Technically this response must

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,390
be returned within 60 seconds from the request. But

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,340
that's a long time. We've talked about the importance

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,800
about returning a response as quickly as possible to

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,050
our dear users. And we don't want them to

11
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,260
wait, even for seconds, right? And certainly not 60

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,510
seconds. You want to deliver that response as quickly as

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,870
possible. But let's say that the user activity triggers

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,340
something big to happen. For example, the user adds a

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,720
new conference and as a consequence of that 10,000

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,510
emails should be sent out to notify other users about

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,650
this conference. First of all, that's not possible within

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,340
60 seconds. And secondly, you certainly don't want the

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,960
poor user that just registered the conference to wait

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,550
for this to happen. Remember, the screen update depends on

21
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,340
your response so even seconds are crucial to keep

22
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,790
your application responsive. Come to the rescue are task

23
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,510
queues. This is exactly the problem task queues solve.

24
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,590
And it may not be emails triggering the need for

25
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,700
this, it could be something else. For example, an

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,300
image needs to be analyzed or a video needs to

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,800
be re-encoded. Many things that are not needed to

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,840
complete the request for the user, could use task queues
