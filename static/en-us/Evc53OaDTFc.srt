1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,430
So how do we apply this to clustering,
okay?

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,320
Well, basically the idea is you,
you're going to clust together

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,060
all the data points that are in
an attraction basin of one mode.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,870
So, what's an attraction basin?

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,580
An attraction basin is the region for
which all the trajectories lead to

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,360
the same mode, or
all the points go there, all right?

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,210
So here's a very simple example.

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,083
So here is a set of points,
drawn from a distribution.

9
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,837
And you can tell, obviously that,

10
00:00:30,837 --> 00:00:34,850
the idea is that there probably is
a mode here, and theres a mode there.

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,330
Great, the question is,
which points belong to which mode?

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,160
And that's done very simply by,
if you were to start your mean shift

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,622
in each of these locations,
which mode does it end up at?

14
00:00:48,622 --> 00:00:51,518
All right, and that's illustrated
in this figure here, right?

15
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:56,670
So, here we're showing
you the area of which

16
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,050
all of the, the mean shifts get to
this mode, the mode on the right.

17
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,310
Likewise, everywhere over here,
they get to the mode on the left.

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,620
So it clusters your feature space

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,480
using these basins of attraction
to the two modes, all right?

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,050
So, when we're going to do this for

21
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,820
segmenting a color image, what we
have to do is define some feature.

22
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,920
So maybe we're using just u and
v or maybe u, v, and x, y,

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,530
if we want a color and location.

24
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,030
We have to initialize the window,
the windows at every pixel,

25
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,430
that is every possible color
point in that LUV space.

26
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,470
Now, would you do every one?

27
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,730
No, you would take a sampling of them.

28
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,083
You do mean shift until it converges.

29
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:43,129
And then you merge all the pixels,
all those initial points into

30
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:48,300
a single cluster that all end
up at the same peak, all right?

31
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,542
And so, that looks a little
bit like this, all right?

32
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:56,475
So here, L and U, this is L and V, okay?

33
00:01:56,475 --> 00:02:00,200
These are the actual pixel colors,
distributed.

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,422
And if you run your clustering,

35
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:07,208
and here, it's being done in this,
LU space, all right?

36
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:10,449
If you run your mean shift here,
okay, you will see,

37
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,780
see all these points going
up to that peak right there?

38
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,750
And then there's a peak here,
and a peak here, and a peak here?

39
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,442
Those, let's see, one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

40
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:24,949
so there's seven modes here, and that
means there seven basins of attraction,

41
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:28,170
which means you would end up
with seven regions in the image.
