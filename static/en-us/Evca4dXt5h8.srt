1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,504
All right, here is how I did it. I go through the first step, miles driven is

2
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:11,413
50,000. The first miles per gallon is 10. So, that's 5000. The price per gallon

3
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:18,984
is 4. 5000 times 4 is 20,000. Now moving on to the next step, the purchase

4
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:24,797
price for the first car is 15,000 plus the 20,000. From over here, gets my

5
00:00:24,797 --> 00:00:31,473
total cost of 35000 over the life time of the car. With the second car, again

6
00:00:31,473 --> 00:00:38,544
we drive a 50000 miles. Now the miles per gallon is 50. 50000 over 50 is a 1000

7
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:47,476
times 4 because we have $4 per gallon, is 4,000 for the gas cost. The purchase

8
00:00:47,476 --> 00:00:54,154
price was 30,000, plus the gas cost 4,000 gets me to 34,000. Now let's go on

9
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:58,640
with the algorithm, is total cost one less than total cost two? No it's not,

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,715
35,000 is bigger than 34,000. So the algorithm tells us to buy car two. Well,

11
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:08,345
what a relief. I never wanted to buy that one in the first place. But now I

12
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:14,125
have a procedure that is unambiguous, executable, and terminating that tells me

13
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:20,314
what car to buy. So, this is a great example of an algorithm It is a recipe of

14
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:24,767
steps each of which is so simple that a computer or a human can execute them

15
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:31,338
and it reaches an answer. Now, you will notice that this algorithm here was

16
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:34,992
written up in some mixture of plain English and Math not in Java code or not in

17
00:01:34,992 --> 00:01:40,848
any other computer language. This is called Pseudocode, and Pseudocode is

18
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:46,050
really important. When you want to develop an algorithm before you get to coded

19
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,743
up in Java or another programming language. What most programmers do when they

20
00:01:51,743 --> 00:01:55,106
need to solve a complex problem is they first get out a sheet of paper and

21
00:01:55,106 --> 00:02:00,605
describe the problem in Pseudocode and then they write in Java. Pseudocode

22
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:04,385
doesn't have anyway near as many rules as Java does, but so it's a good idea to

23
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:09,912
restrict oneself to simple constructs in Psuedocode. Let me show you what those

24
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:10,860
would be.
