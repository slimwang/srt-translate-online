1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer is 93,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
the reason being there's 7 straight steps to the goal.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You can go down here or up here.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And suppose we go up here and we wanted to turn clockwise,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which is the one that gets us oriented towards the goal.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But that costs us -10, but we can turn 3 times counterclockwise.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We first turn left and down and then right.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And the total cost of this is 0 because each counterclockwise turn

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
is worth 0, therefore, we just go straight to the goal,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and we only pay the straight motion cost, which is 7 in total

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
because it's -7 for the straight penalty

12
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
plus 100 is 93.
