1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,070
These two lines are going to intersect. For the first equation, I just need to

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,033
subtract 2x from both sides. And I get 1y is equal to negative 2x plus 3. For

3
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:14,869
the second equation, I need to add 20 to both sides to isolate the 10y. So I

4
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:19,952
have 5x plus 20 is equal to 10y. Finally, I divide each term by 10 and I get 1y

5
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:24,581
is equal to the 2 plus 1 half x. I'm going to rewrite this equation flipped

6
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:29,287
over, the y's in the left, and 1 half x plus 2 is on the right. When I look at

7
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:34,087
the two equations, I notice that their slopes are different so they must

8
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:34,950
intersect.
