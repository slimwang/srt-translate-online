00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,040
Now let's come back to aesthetics.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:10,140
I mentioned this at the start, and I wanted to see how some two, in particular,

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,010
two classical authors have kind of captured the notion of aesthetics and

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,810
what relationship that might have to software design.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,540
The first is Aquinas.

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:26,200
I won't quote for you the, the Latin but what it, what it boils down to

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:33,080
is that beauty, elegance, resolve to wholeness, harmony and radiance.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,420
And we can think of that as far as software is concerned as completeness,

9
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,910
consistency and conceptual integrity.

10
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,350
Other quote comes from Pascal,

11
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,850
you may have heard of the Pascal programming language.

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,260
Pascal was a French mathematician, and one of my favorite quotes is he said,

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,140
he apologized in a letter saying, sorry I didn't have I would have

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,510
written you a shorter letter, but I didn't have time.

15
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,700
If you think about it for a minute, what this means is it takes a lot of

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,120
time and energy to come up with an elegant solution that looks quite simple on

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,329
the surface, but really satisfies the complex requirements.
