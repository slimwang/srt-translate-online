1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,719
The first pair of equations
define the same plane.

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:05,689
In fact, you can obtain the second
equation from the first

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,890
by multiplying through by
the common factor negative 2.5.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,850
The second pair of equations
are neither parallel nor equal.

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,670
The coefficients of the variables
in the first equation cannot

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,850
be transformed into the coefficients
in the second equation

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,920
by multiplying by a common factor.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,940
So the normal vectors for

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,800
the two planes are not parallel, meaning
that the planes are not parallel.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,160
Since equal planes must be parallel this
means the planes aren't equal either.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,920
The third pair of equations
define parallel planes.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,510
If you just consider the coefficients
of the variables in the first equation,

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,630
dividing them each by a factor of three
will give you the coefficients of

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,900
the second equation.

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,110
This means that the planes have parallel
normal vectors, so they are parallel.

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,290
However, the planes are not equal.

17
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,520
Now the fun part of this is
that the code I wrote for

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,570
this problem is almost exactly the same
as the code I wrote for the lines.

19
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,960
The only difference I made is that
I use the variable P to stand for

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,000
plane, instead of L to stand for a line.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,540
But, logically, my is_parallel_to and

22
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,360
eq functions are equivalent to
the functions for the line class.

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,510
And here's the test code I
used to answer the questions.

24
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,680
Running it gives me
the answers I showed earlier.
