00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,950
Today we will talk about diagnosis. Diagnosis is the identification of the fault

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,280
or faults responsible for a malfunctioning system. The system it could be a car,

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,140
a computer program, an organism, or

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,990
the economy. Diagnosis builds on our discussion of classification and

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,690
configuration. They start by defining diagnosis. They really setup two spaces.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,430
A data spaces and a hypothesis space. Data about the malfunctioning system.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,970
Hypothesis about the fault that can explain that malfunctioning system.

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,190
Then, we'll constructing mappings through data space to hypothesis space

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,650
which amount to diagnosis. We'll discuss two views of diagnosis,

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,990
diagnosis as classification and diagnosis as abduction. Abduction in

11
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,420
this context is a new term to you. We'll discuss it in more detail today.
