1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And this is the one thing that's really important--variance is a quadratic expression.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A final multiplier of the outcome goes out quadratically, and we talked about this,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
you might have forgotten it--it's not important.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I think now that you see it again, you might hopefully remember it.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That means if you multiply 1/N inside the variance, the 1/N² outside,

6
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
N²=4 in this case, 0.5/4 is 0.125
