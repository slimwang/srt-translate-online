1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,710
Stuxnet, we're going to talk about
when we talk of malware,exploited some

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,730
zero day or vulnerabilities that
were not known at the time.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,590
So the exploit zero day of course in
every system is not going to help you.

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,300
So it's not the first case.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,510
It's not easy to guess passwords,

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,040
because you can't remotely access it you
had to physically get into the plant.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,870
So it has to be the second option here.

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,330
It was an isolated network, so

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,670
the only way you can breach the air gap
is through a humans helping you do that.

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,840
So either it's poor
judgement by an employee or

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,800
an employee who was
a spy of somebody else.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,290
So you really had to breach the air
gap to access the computers and

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,050
that requires that people
participated in this.
