00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,744
So let's do another Iron Law performance quiz,

2
00:00:02,744 --> 00:00:05,999
this time with unequal cycles per instruction. The

3
00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:09,284
program has 50 billion instructions, out of which

4
00:00:09,284 --> 00:00:12,642
ten billion are branch instructions for which we spent

5
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:16,059
four cycles per instruction. 15 billion are loads

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,190
for which we spent two cycles per instruction.

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,230
5 billion are store instructions for which the

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,346
CPI is three and the remaining instruction in the

9
00:00:25,346 --> 00:00:29,810
program are integer adds for which the CPI is one. We do one of those per

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,640
cycle. We clock this processor at four gigahertz.

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,530
So the execution time is how many seconds?
