00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,712
the previous example. So, the most specific case is that I'm simply allergic to

3
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:12,085
any breakfast that comes on Friday that's cheap and isn't vegan, so

4
00:00:12,085 --> 00:00:15,720
this very specific example. And the most general model is I'm just

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,720
allergic to everything, no matter what meal it is, what day it is,

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,230
how much it costs, whether it's vegan, or what restaurant I got it at.
