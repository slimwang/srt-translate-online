1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,830
You can use OCL for a variety of voices. You can specify invariants on classes

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,450
in your class model diagrams. You can describe pre and post conditions on

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,330
the operations, in your diagrams. You can specify derivation rules for

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,800
derived attributes. Remember them? You can describe guards on transitions

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,290
in statecharts. You can specify the targets for messages and

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,650
actions, you can speci, specify type invariants for

7
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,600
stereotypes, which we'll describe a little bit later. You can even use it

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,550
as a query language. Class model diagram is describing a set of.

9
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:46,090
Possible instances, and you might wish to query those instances for

10
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,550
certain things, OCL can be used as a query language in that sense.
