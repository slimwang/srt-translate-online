00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,900
Before moving on, I want to make a brief
comment about your goals as a parallel

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,470
algorithm designer with
respect to work and span.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,190
One goal is to achieve
a degree of work that matches

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,580
the best sequential algorithm.

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,030
I called this goal one of
achieving work optimality.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,890
Now I want you to hearken back to the
days of sequential algorithm design yore

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,410
just for a sec.

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,960
Now from what you learned back then,
your holy grail was to

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,980
find a linear time or even sub-linear
time sequential algorithm.

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,610
This isn't always possible but
it's a good goal.

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,610
And since you want to be work optimal,

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,010
that grail is the same with respect
to work in the parallel case.

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,980
So what's the holy grail for span?

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,105
So what I'm going to do is,

15
00:00:41,105 --> 00:00:46,090
I'm always going to ask you to find
algorithms with polylogarithmic span.

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,770
So polylogarithmic means
log n to some power.

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,430
So that might be log n, log squared n,
log cubed n, and so on.

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,970
So always remember this principle
of poly-logarithmic span.

19
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,010
That's what we'll mean
when we say low span.

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,178
So what's special about poly logs?

21
00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:08,554
Well, since log n grows asymptotically
a lot more slowly than n, and

22
00:01:08,554 --> 00:01:13,084
since O(n) is our work goal then
poly-logarithmic span ensures that

23
00:01:13,084 --> 00:01:17,222
the average available
parallelism grows with n.

24
00:01:17,222 --> 00:01:20,440
Now, you'll always have to use your
judgement about whether a given parallel

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,300
algorithm has good working span but
please use these ideals as a guide.
