In order to set up our x and y axes to graph this equation right here, we need

2
00:00:04,086 --> 00:00:08,266
to think about how long we want each of them to be or what values you want them

3
00:00:08,278 --> 00:00:12,365
to extend through. Of course, we know that when we graph a set of x and y axes,

4
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:16,634
we put arrows in the end to indicate that they actually extend infinitely long

5
00:00:16,646 --> 00:00:20,844
in each direction, but I am just interested in finding out what range of values

6
00:00:20,856 --> 00:00:25,505
for both x and y we should display on our graph. The goal here is to pick a

7
00:00:25,517 --> 00:00:30,225
range for x and possibly a different range for y, so that all of the values we

8
00:00:30,237 --> 00:00:32,689
have on our table are shown on our graph.
