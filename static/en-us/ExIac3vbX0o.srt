00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,040
In the previous lesson,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,270
we looked at different ways that one
view controller can present another.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,620
In this lesson, we're going to learn
about the delegate design pattern.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,100
Many of the most common views in
UIKit use this design pattern,

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,840
including text views, pickers,
tables, and collections.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,040
Delegates are used to make important
connections between model, view, and

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,150
controller.

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,190
We'll start out by focusing on how
the delegate pattern is used with

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:23,960
text fields.
