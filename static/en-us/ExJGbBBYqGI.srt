1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,980
So now, we could do the total rigid transformations.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,640
So a total rigid transformation, if I have some point in the A system,

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,290
I first have to rotate to get aligned in the B system, and then I

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,800
have to offset it by whatever the offset of the A system in the B system is,

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,779
that's what this equation says.

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,900
Using homogeneous transformation, or

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,030
homogeneous coordinates, we can do this all in one step.

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,200
So here, we have a rigid transformation and it's really nice, right?

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,040
We have our point here.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,910
We've rotated it, and then we've translated it.

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,940
And what that says is we have this single matrix.

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,880
Right? This part here is a three by three.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,650
This is a three by one.

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,250
This is a one by three of 0s.

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,550
This is just a 1.

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,600
So our total transformation matrix is a four by four.

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,160
And it does the, both the rotation and transfer, and, and translation.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,720
Cool, right?

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,420
It gets better.

20
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,470
Thank God.

21
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,290
So here I've written what we had before.

22
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,340
We have P in the A frame, expressed in homogeneous coordinates.

23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,890
Here is our four by four transformation matrix.

24
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,570
Here is B expressed in the B frame.

25
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,490
And I'm just going to write this as transformation from A to B.

26
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,800
But suppose I wanted to go from B to A?

27
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,780
Well, that would be written as transformation from B to A, and

28
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,580
I'd have the point P in the, in the A frame.

29
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,620
But the way to get that transformation is to

30
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,310
just invert the A to B to get me the B to A.

31
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,770
And then, this transformation takes the,

32
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,440
the value from the B frame back to the A frame.

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,300
And the idea is that our transformation matrices are,

34
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,800
homogeneous transformation four by fours, are typically invertible.

35
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,980
And so, once we have one that goes from, say, a camera to world frame,

36
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,420
we can go from a world to camera fame or, or, or the other way around.

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,100
And this invertibility of homogeneous transformations is very powerful and

38
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,800
used all the time.
