00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,050
It's just let's quickly review
the how to make an anaglyph image.

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,620
First take a greyscale stereo pair.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,580
We copy the left image to the red
channel of the new image and

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,600
then copy the right image to the green
and blue channels of the anaglyph image.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,280
That's cyan.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,840
With, view through a red-cyan glasses,
left eye only sees the left image.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,295
Right eye sees only the right image and
the brain fuses to form 3D, simple.

8
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,810
Now of course some of
you might be curious

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,630
as to why the glasses that we use in
watching 3D movies are no longer.

10
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,370
They used to be for

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,060
those of you who remember from
days earlier are red and cyan.

12
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,440
Nowadays they're different.

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,650
I encourage to start looking up that and
ask that question.

14
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,720
And figure out why that's the case and

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,990
what's different
nowadays in the cameras.

16
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,590
Both and also the display mechanisms
that actually work with different types

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,650
of classes.
