1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,070
We can just filter the image, right?

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,797
So we filter the image, tada.

3
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:04,372
Yuck.

4
00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:05,527
All right.

5
00:00:05,527 --> 00:00:08,760
You know, the first thing
that happens is you realize

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,550
you've got all of these white pixels.

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,270
Why is that?

8
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,171
Well, because they didn't have
a huge amount of V but they,

9
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:20,685
they still had, a reasonable
amount of that Y, all right?

10
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:22,545
So how would filter out
these bright pixels?

11
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:26,745
Well duh, you would just reduce
the requirement on the luminance,

12
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:29,865
we're not going to allow all
of the Y pixels anymore.

13
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:32,034
Instead, we'll filter,
we might say, well,

14
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:36,960
we're going to allow the luminance of
just, I don't know, 0 to 150, let's say.

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,660
And so that would eliminate, so
here we are in the same, right?

16
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,860
That, so
that would capture all of these pixels.

17
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,550
All right?

18
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,920
So now if we use that, right?

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,880
We in,
we include the Y value of 0 to 150,

20
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,520
we get a much better
selection of the red pixels.

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,550
And this is just to show you comparison
that it's just easier to do this on the,

22
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,462
in the YUV space than the RGB space.

23
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,450
The only reason this is easier
is because we're using boxes.

24
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,110
Right.
Because there's a linear combination of

25
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,220
RGB that will give you almost prelim,
it'll give you YUV.

26
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,260
If you could orient your boxes they
would end being the same filter, but

27
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,835
if your trying to limit the boxes
they would be straightforward.
