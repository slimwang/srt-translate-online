00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:05,021
Negative 10 3rds is correct.We start by multiplying each set of our equation by

2
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:11,380
5 plus y, the common denominator. Another way to think about it would be cross

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:18,072
multiplying 1 times 5 is 5 and at 3 times 5 plus y is 15 plus 3y. We subtract 15

4
00:00:18,072 --> 00:00:23,372
from both sides and then divide by 3 to get y is equal to negative 10 thirds.
