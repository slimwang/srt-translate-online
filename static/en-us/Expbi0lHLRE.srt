1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,710
Because it's being created within an activity, it can be

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,400
terminated as simply as rotating the phone into a different

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,710
orientation. So, should only ever be used for tasks whose

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,050
lifecycle is tied to the host activity, and is expected

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,420
to run for only a second or two. On mobile,

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,100
it's unwise to assume that even the most trivial network

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,680
access is going to happen quickly. So a better approach

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,770
would be to use a service. An application component without

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,220
the UI that's less likely to be

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,820
interrupted. Possibly scheduled using an inexact repeating alarm.

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,860
Even better, Android has a specialized solution know

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,170
as Async Adapter. And it's designed especially to schedule

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,700
your background data syncs as efficiently as possible. Better

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,830
still would be using Google Cloud Messaging. This lets

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,740
you notify your Async Adapter of changes on the

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,460
server side. So you're only ever initiating network requests

17
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,510
from your app when you know there's something to

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,030
be updated on the server. For now we're concentrating

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,340
on making our app work when it's in the foreground. But we'll return to

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,340
look at these approaches to invisibly updating

21
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,890
your app from the background a little

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,200
later. For now, keep in mind that the Refresh button and the new thread

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,530
solution is just a place holder while we hook up the rest of the app.
