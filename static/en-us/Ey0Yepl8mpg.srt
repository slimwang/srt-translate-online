00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,060
Setting up an AdWords campaign
can be pretty simple.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,400
You start by creating your ad settings,

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,670
then writing what your
offer is in the ad.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,420
Next, choose the keywords you want
people to use when they're searching

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,310
for your ad.

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,930
Then set your daily budget and bidding.

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,329
Just those few steps,
you're ready to go live.

8
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,250
However, before you do this you're
going to need to set up your overall

9
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,830
account settings.

10
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,041
Now when you're doing this,

11
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,530
be sure to check out
the instructions on how to do it.

12
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,760
Once you set your country and

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,690
your currency,
you're unable to go back and change it.

14
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,400
So after you complete your settings,
you can make your ad campaign.

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,965
Your ad campaign is built
out by different ad groups.

16
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:37,135
Each ad group has its own ad,
keywords, and bids.

17
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:41,785
And all these share the same budget,
location targeting, timing, and

18
00:00:41,785 --> 00:00:42,795
settings.

19
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:45,865
Different campaigns can help you
organize categories of your products or

20
00:00:45,865 --> 00:00:47,210
your services that you offer.

21
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,895
And when your starting the campaign,

22
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:50,910
you're going to need to
customize your settings.

23
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,830
These settings include
things like location,

24
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,140
languages, bidding strategy,
budget, ad extensions.

25
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,950
Things like that.

26
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,830
Google has a ton of documentation
on each one of these settings

27
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:00,770
that you could check out.

28
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,160
There's a link in
the instructor note for this.

29
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,450
But don't worry, you can adjust your
bid strategy or budgeting at any time.

30
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,020
Actually, not only can you do this,
you're really encouraged to do it, so

31
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,990
that way you can optimize your campaign
regularly, based on the performance

32
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,730
of an ad group or even the individual
ad and the keywords that you have.

33
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,380
So once your keyword's in place, you can
start creating your add group structure.

34
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,550
So from the top level, you're going
to start with your account, which is

35
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,710
connected to your user name, email
address, password, and billing info.

36
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,380
You can have various
campaigns under one account

37
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,665
that are going to share
the same general settings.

38
00:01:35,665 --> 00:01:40,035
And from there you can have ad groups
nested under a simple campaign.

39
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:44,265
We're going to title our first campaign
customer acquisition promo offer

40
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:48,857
because we're going to offer new members
to a of 15% off coupon and later.

41
00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:51,897
We can set up different campaigns that
are going to run at the same time to

42
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:53,487
achieve different goals.

43
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:57,767
So we may want to do brand awareness or
a special campaign for the holidays or

44
00:01:57,767 --> 00:02:02,058
summer vacations based on the
seasonality we noticed in Google Trends.

45
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:04,518
The first ad group is
going to be dog owners and

46
00:02:04,518 --> 00:02:06,788
the second ad group is
going to be dog sitters.

47
00:02:06,788 --> 00:02:09,157
We've separated these out because
we want different ads and

48
00:02:09,157 --> 00:02:12,118
different messaging for
our different groups.

49
00:02:12,118 --> 00:02:13,898
Our dog sitters may want
to hear about the extra

50
00:02:13,898 --> 00:02:15,779
income they're going to receive.

51
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:19,889
On the other hand, our dog owners may
want to hear about the luxury we offer,

52
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,539
or the safe environment we're offering
their dogs, while they're away.

53
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:25,509
And from there,
we're going to develop our ads and

54
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:27,860
different keywords that are specific for
each group.
