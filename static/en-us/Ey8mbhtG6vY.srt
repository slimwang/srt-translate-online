The answer is, we don't need any imports between crawler and search. There's no

2
00:00:03,726 --> 00:00:07,822
definitions in crawler that are used by search and there's no definitions in

3
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:11,659
search that are used by crawler. But we do need imports in test. And we need

4
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:16,344
both of these, we need test to import crawler since it's using crawl_web, which

5
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:20,670
is coming from crawler. We also need test import search since it's using

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,623
lucky_search and ordered_search, which are coming from search.
