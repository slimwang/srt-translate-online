1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,200
Now how do we actually compute
these types of things for images.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,910
How can we actually deblur imagines
that are actually because of focus.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,880
So here are two different
sets of examples.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,580
These are actually approaches
proposed by Levin et al., in 2007.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,260
Basically, the two methods
they proposed as one exploit,

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,420
prior information on natural images.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,230
Look and model the types of signal
deconvolutions that happen from natural

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,520
images like this.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,240
And actually use that to figure out
depth discontinuities and discrimination

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,260
that will allow us to improve
deconvolution and also depth estimation.

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,390
So, you know, natural images or scenes
like this, unnatural images would be,

12
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,880
you know, random noise types of things.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,360
The other method, and this is the one we
will actually focus on in this lecture,

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,816
is basically come up with
different patterns and

15
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:50,390
that basically use these
patterns on the lens itself.

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,744
So make a defocus pattern that is known.

17
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:55,060
In this case, it's the aperture itself.

18
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,750
But change the defocus pattern to have
some sort of a characteristic like this

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,340
and use that discriminate where
the defocus is differently for

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,880
different planes of defocus
planes in an image.

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,949
Again, we'll talk about
this in lot more detail.

22
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:12,744
And the idea really comes up is that
what we want to do is come up with

23
00:01:12,744 --> 00:01:14,180
a coded aperture.

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,860
An aperture that would have different
characteristics like this, and

25
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,200
you can put this inside a lens
before the image is formed,

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,830
the amount of light that goes in
through the lens, through the sensor.

27
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,055
If you can put this in,
we can actually perhaps,

28
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:28,505
quantify the defocus on the sensor.

29
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,700
And that will actually let us know how
to deconvolve it based on the fact

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,640
that we have actually quantified
what the focus plane would be.
