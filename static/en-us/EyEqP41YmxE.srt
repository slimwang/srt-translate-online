00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:06,010
We would get 5x plus 6 equals 6x squared. Great algebra work for getting that

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,972
one correct. The LCD, or the lowest common denominator, is x squared here. We

3
00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:15,836
only need to look at these two denominators, and since x is already a factor of

4
00:00:15,836 --> 00:00:20,965
x squared, we use this as the LCD. Multiplying each term by the LCD, we would

5
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:26,410
get 5x for the first term, 6 for the second term and 6x squared for this term.

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,229
We get 5x here since we will have one more x in the numerator than we would in

7
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:37,495
the denominator. This one power of x cancels leaving us with 5 times x, or 5x.

8
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:41,940
Here, the x squared's reduced to 1, so we're left with positive 6. And here, we

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,854
just multiply these two expressions together to get 6x squared.
