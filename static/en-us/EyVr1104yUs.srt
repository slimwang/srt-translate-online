1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,320
Let's take another example to
now start building the kinds of

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,480
curves that we're interested
in from real data.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,960
Just to keep things simple,
rather than use my stack of real images,

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,440
I'm just going to showcase these small
types of ramp gray scale images here.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,160
And I've basically have, kind of
simulated them to have a shutter speed

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,480
of 1/64, darker image, 1/16,
1/4, 1 sec and 4 secs.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,390
It gets from darker to brighter.

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,670
Again, we're interested in getting to I,
the intensities.

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,690
G is my function, and

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,600
the thing that we want to extract
from is exposure H, right?

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,570
I mean that is the relationship,
because remember the rest of it

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,920
we actually were able to get
to from the camera itself.

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,450
So now to get an exposure basically
we would base, have to compute

14
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,230
the irradiance, E, and with the time and
we know all of this of course.

15
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,960
We can also do this in log because
that actually makes our curves and

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,700
everything appear nice.

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,060
And of course just,
I'm showing these pixel values here.

18
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,870
And I'm going to basically create
an axis, the log of an exposure H.

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,380
What we can do now is find, let's say,
three points, one, two and three here.

20
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,550
At three different points,
I've colored them differently so

21
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,760
we can see where they are.

22
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,020
And of course I now in this instance can
pick out what their values would be.

23
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,880
Similarly now I can find three
similar exact points in another image.

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,060
And I'm actually just randomly
walking around in these five images.

25
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,950
And if you notice that basically
I can find these three

26
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,260
points in all of these images.

27
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,720
You know how to get these images,
feature tracking and

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,330
feature detection work, or
feature matching work that we looked at

29
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,130
allows you to find these types
of things in a real image.

30
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,660
This is just a synthetic test
case that I'm showing you.

31
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,930
Of course, after I find these points,

32
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,700
I can actually use this
to plot these values.

33
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,150
Of course, I'm showing this purple here.

34
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,670
While I just have five images here,
you can imagine I may have more.

35
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,410
And this would allow me to get
a bunch of different values here.

36
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,590
So here you have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

37
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,480
ten, eleven, and so on.

38
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,090
This allows me to kind of,
you know, blot these out.

39
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,420
I can do the same for turquoise.

40
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,900
And here is the range change
that's happening in this one.

41
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,750
Pixel values, log of Exposure.

42
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,940
Based on this calculations again,
pure data.

43
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,190
And in case of the yellow, basically
we see this kind of phenomenon.

44
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,910
Where basically again we
have points like this.

45
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,480
So I took a lot of samples, over ten
plus, and this is what it gave me.
