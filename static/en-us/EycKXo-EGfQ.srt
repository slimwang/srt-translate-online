00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here comes a tricky question.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Given that we have a pie chart with distribution 80% and 20%,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm now changing the total number of voter.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm telling you there were 23,000 people voting for party B,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and I'm asking you how many voted for party A such that

6
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the pie chart over here is exactly the correct one with an 80 to 20 distribution.
