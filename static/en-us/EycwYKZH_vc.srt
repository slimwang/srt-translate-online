1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,505
We want the absolute value of f to be greater than 5, or the distance of f from

2
00:00:04,517 --> 00:00:09,035
zero to be larger than 5. If f were here, it wouldn't be more than 5 units away,

3
00:00:09,137 --> 00:00:13,475
so this number line is out. If f were out here, beyond negative 5, then the

4
00:00:13,487 --> 00:00:18,089
distance to zero would definitely be more than 5. So, this is part of the

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:23,037
solution. But there are also other values over here, like 6 and 7, which have a

6
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:27,864
distance greater than 5. So, we want both of these regions. If you chose this

7
00:00:27,876 --> 00:00:32,812
one, nice work. Any number in either region, this one or this one, would work.
