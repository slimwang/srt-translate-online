1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,800
Another way to perform traffic engineering is with

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,890
Multipath Routing, where an operator can establish multiple

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,446
paths in advance. This approach applies both to

4
00:00:10,446 --> 00:00:13,590
intra-domain routing, and inter-domain routing. The way this

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,309
is done in intra-domain routing is to set

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,620
link weights such that multiple paths of equal

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,370
cost exist between two nodes in the graph.

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,980
This approach is called equal cost multi path.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,240
Thus traffic will be split across paths that

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,990
have equal costs through the network. A source

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,660
router might also be able to change the

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,780
fraction of traffic that's sent along each one

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,300
of these paths. Sending for example 35% along

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,950
the top path and 65% along the bottom

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,780
path. It might even be able to do

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,160
this based on the level of congestion that's observed

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,790
along these paths. The way that the router would do this is by having

18
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,089
multiple forwarding table entries with different [INAUDIBLE]

19
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:00,468
stops for outgoing packets to the same destination.
