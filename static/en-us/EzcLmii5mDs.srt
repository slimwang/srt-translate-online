1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,050
We have the same database that
we were talking about, but

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,710
we're going to do a different
kind of attack here.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,055
We're going to de-identify it
by removing student ID, so

4
00:00:10,055 --> 00:00:13,650
de-identification, you take
the database, drop the attribute that

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,440
is student ID, and, if there are names,
maybe we remove those, too.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,520
Furthermore, the field that has the
state of the student because we just now

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,580
saw in the previous question that,

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,410
if there are too few students from
a given state that could be a problem.

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,119
So we're going to do generalization
by replacing state with sort of

10
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,090
the US region.

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,760
East Coast, Midwest, West Coast,
whatever way you want to do it.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,090
We're not asking for a specific state.

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,160
That is too small and has only one or
a small number of students.

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,138
So this generalization is essentially
replacing state by a larger geography,

15
00:00:52,138 --> 00:00:57,460
hoping that there'll be more students
who would come from the geography.

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,350
The generalization ensures that
there are at least two students from

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,890
each region.

18
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,710
The problem where we only had
one from Wyoming is going away.

19
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,720
Are inference attacks still possible?

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,380
Again, yes-no possibility,
so think about it.
