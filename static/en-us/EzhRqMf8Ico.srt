00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,640
What do you think, David?

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,810
>> So just like last time we'll set
that the goal is to get the batter out

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,270
via pitching.

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,810
And we'll add the necessary information
to our current working memory, but

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,450
when we get down here
something confusing happens.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,880
So we suggest
the throw-curve-ball operator

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,620
because our goal is to pitch and
the batter isn't out.

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,980
But then, we also suggest they throw
a fast ball operator because the goal is

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,880
to pitch, the batter's not out and
the batter bats left-handed.

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,300
So, when we get down to rule seven,

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,189
which is if only one operator has
been selected, it doesn't fire.

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,530
So our current rules don't
actually lead anywhere.

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,190
We never bottom out.

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,190
We never figure out what we want to do.

15
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,750
>> Good David.

16
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,740
That was the correct answer.

17
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,080
So note what has happened?

18
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,082
So far we had assumed that
the match between the percept and

19
00:00:46,082 --> 00:00:51,234
the production rules captioning the
personal knowledge was such that, given

20
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:56,091
the percept we always have one rule
which will tell us what action to take.

21
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:57,902
It may take some time
to get to this rule.

22
00:00:57,902 --> 00:01:00,135
Some rules may need to be established.

23
00:01:00,135 --> 00:01:01,015
And then only so

24
00:01:01,015 --> 00:01:03,885
the rules get established,
then only we get the action.

25
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:06,055
But never the less,
the system would work.

26
00:01:06,055 --> 00:01:07,685
The difficulty now is,

27
00:01:07,685 --> 00:01:10,885
there is no rule which tells us
exactly what action to take.
