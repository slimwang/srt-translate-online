00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,192
So we use the factored form of our polynomial function to find its zeros. And

2
00:00:05,192 --> 00:00:09,596
interestingly enough both of these zeros were ratios. But where did these

3
00:00:09,596 --> 00:00:14,310
ratios come from? They're in a very specific form. I'll give you two options.

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,763
Are each of these zeros a ratio of A factor of negative 5 over a factor of 6 or

5
00:00:18,763 --> 00:00:24,951
a factor of 6 over a factor of negative 5. Remember that 6 and negative 5 here

6
00:00:24,951 --> 00:00:28,219
are coming straight from our original function.
