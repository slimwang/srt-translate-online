00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,240
You may have already thought of this, but another thing we could do is two

2
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:08,800
memory tests on each person, one where they don't get much sleep, and one where

3
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:13,296
they get a lot of sleep. Then we can compare the results between each person's

4
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:18,220
test. If we did this, what would we be controlling for? Would we be controlling

5
00:00:18,232 --> 00:00:23,495
for differences in memory capabilities due to gender, or differing amounts of

6
00:00:23,507 --> 00:00:28,570
sleep amongst individuals? Or the variation in people's individual memory

7
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:33,095
capabilities? Or time of day at which subjects took the memory test?
