00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,050
One of the most important rules in
security is the rule of least privilege.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,080
Put simply, this means a user or

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,390
an application only has enough
permission to do its job, nothing extra.

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,170
You've already experienced this
within your virtual machine,

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,300
although you may not be aware of it yet.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,370
When we access our virtual machine,
using vagrant ssh.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,570
We're logged in as a standard
user named, vagrant.

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,845
Let's try running a command only
an administrative user would be

9
00:00:29,845 --> 00:00:31,180
allowed to run.

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,230
Let's list all of the files with
in the ubuntu users ssh directory.

11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,720
You see, we get this error here,
permission denied.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,650
Only the ubuntu user or

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,360
the root user can read the files
within this directory.

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,940
You may be thinking, but I am the
administrator of this virtual machine.

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,120
I am root.

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,650
So how do I actually log in as root?

17
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,590
It's time to learn about super user.
