00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,019
I'll start on the left with world
in the entire hamburger icon menu.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,730
I've put these two on the same layer
because they'll be sticking together as

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,560
it slides into the page.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,924
Next up the top nav is static and
doesn't move with anything so

5
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:13,418
it should be its own layer.

6
00:00:13,418 --> 00:00:15,948
And lastly I've put all
the articles on the same layer.

7
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:19,580
Which makes sense because they stick
together as a user scrolls up and down.
