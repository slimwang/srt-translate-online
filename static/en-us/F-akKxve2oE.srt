00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,250
Earlier, I mentioned it's
important to make sure that

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:08,090
the content fits within the viewport
to prevent horizontal scrolling.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,050
You should use relative units
when specifying widths for

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,440
elements to prevent them from
accidentally overflowing the viewport.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,050
Keep in mind, CSS does allow
content to overflow it's container.

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,810
So if you don't specify a side and,
say, for

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:28,430
example the image is bigger than
the container, it will overflow.

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,240
You can save yourself some headache, and

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,350
prevent this from happening by
setting a max width of 100%.

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,642
In fact, I recommend adding a catch
all in your main CSS for image,

11
00:00:40,642 --> 00:00:46,060
embed, object and video elements,
that sets this, just to be safe
