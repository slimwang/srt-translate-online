1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,929
So once you've identified maybe a bunch
of people you want to interview and

2
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:07,540
maybe offer a job to.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,818
Being compelling to them, why should
they come on board with you beyond

4
00:00:11,818 --> 00:00:16,180
obviously just getting a paycheck,
can be a challenge in and of itself.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,020
I personally have received many
recruiting emails that say, hey, we're

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,979
a hot new startup doing this thing,
that I really just don't care about.

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:31,233
So being able to infuse or fire up
people's passions about what they care

8
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:35,865
about is probably the most critical
element in the hiring process.

9
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:40,296
And having a way to engage the middle
level that would let them commit to you

10
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:43,960
and your business and
the growth of your business over time.

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,216
Doing that means being passionate about
what you say and why you're doing this,

12
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,529
and being honest, and
maybe a little vulnerable, too.

13
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:55,568
It's an uncomfortable place to be and

14
00:00:55,568 --> 00:00:59,080
requires a lot of sort of emotional
intelligence on your behalf.
