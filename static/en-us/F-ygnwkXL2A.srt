1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,620
The answer is that this third
step here is problematic.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,710
And it's problematic because there
are languages where the maximum string

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,490
length is unbounded.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,750
Remember that languages can have
an infinite number of strings.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,760
So there are languages where,

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,830
no matter what length you pick, there is
a string in the language that is longer.

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,450
This union excludes any such language,

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:25,440
because each Si is restricted to
having strings of length at most i.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,190
In fact,
none of the languages in this union

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,780
even contain an infinite
number of strings.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,840
One particular language that is
not in this union is sigma star,

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,480
the language containing every string.
