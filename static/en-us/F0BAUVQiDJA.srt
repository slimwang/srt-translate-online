1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,060
You did awesome.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,430
>> Is that your American accent?

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,112
>> Oh, I don't know.

4
00:00:04,112 --> 00:00:06,960
All right, anyway, in this course,
you learned that your options for

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,670
images go well beyond
a simple image tag.

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:14,350
In fact, you can use the browser's
properties to not only change the source

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,280
of the image to ease, you know,
bandwidth requirements, but

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,390
you can also change the content of
the image using the picture element.

9
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,990
>> And you learn that images
aren't always necessary.

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,540
There are markup alternatives
like icon fonts and

11
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,710
CSS styles that give you low
bandwidth options for images.

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,380
>> But most importantly,
you learned that images

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,800
are an integral part of your
development workflow for modern sites.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,500
Images constitute an enormous percentage
of page load, and screen sizes and

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,790
form factors vary so widely.

16
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,630
Responsive design requires preparing
your images for any device.

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,486
>> Now, you can develop images for
all of these devices.

18
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,522
>> Beauty.

19
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:57,460
>> [LAUGH] Heck, yeah.

20
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,070
>> What?

21
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:58,680
>> What?

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,418
>> I don't know.

23
00:00:59,418 --> 00:01:00,720
>> [LAUGH] See you.

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,220
>> Bye.
