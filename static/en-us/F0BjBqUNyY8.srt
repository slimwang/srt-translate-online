00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:06,160
What do we mean by operating system structure? What we mean by this term is

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,870
the way the operating system software is organized

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,190
with respect to the applications that it serves

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,059
and the underlying hardware that it manages. It's

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,160
sort of like the burger between the buns.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,140
There is application at the top and technology

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,730
or hardware at the bottom and system software

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,160
of the operating system is what connects

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,320
the applications to the underlying hardware. Since

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,610
this lesson is all about operating system structure, I would like to get your

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:41,610
thoughts on why you may think that the structure of an operating system is

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,330
important, and from that point of view I'm going to give you a quiz again.
