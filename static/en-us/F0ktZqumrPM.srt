1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is one per card wouldn't be enough, and in any case,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
the number of cards is really irrelevant.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What's important is the number of possible hands

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and the number of possible results we get for each type of hand,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the rankings we get for each.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
One per card doesn't make sense. 1,000 per card doesn't really help that much.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now we're talking.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So here we say at least expect to get 10 possible results for the least common rank,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
so least common is the straight flush, and if we said

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
if we expect to get 10 straight flushes,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
then probably we're not going to get exactly 10,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
but it's not going to be off by that much.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If we expected only to get one straight flush,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
then maybe half the time we'd get zero, and half the time

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
we'd get 2, and that would be off by a lot.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That wouldn't be very good, but 10 seems about right.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
At least we're in the right ballpark.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If that's the right answer here, then what does that translate over here?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, we can just look up the probability.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We had that on the previous page.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Look up the probability.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's about 1 in 60,000 or 66,000,

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and so if we have a little bit more than 10 of each,

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
then that comes up to 700,000,

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and that's a lot less than 52 factorial, which is the total number

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
of permutations of the hands.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Actually, permutations isn't that important.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
A better number would be the total number of combinations.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But even the total number of combinations is bigger than 700,000,

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
so we're probably okay going here.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And here's the code to calculate the hand percentages.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I give a default value for n, the number of deals that we're going to do,

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
the default of 700,000, but you can put in as many as you want.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And I should say don't try to run this function here

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
with 700,000 as the input because it will take too long.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It should take 20 or 30 seconds,

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and running on our servers, we don't let you run that long,

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
so if you want to run it here, put in a smaller value for n,

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
say 1,000 or so, or if you want to run it on your own home machine,

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
you're welcome to go ahead and do that.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We make up a vector of counts which starts with no count

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
for each of the 9 possibilities, and then we go through

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
the deals, and what I'm going to do is deal 10 hands

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and over 10 times, and for each of those hands,

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I compute the ranking and then increment the count for the ranking,

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and then I just print out the results.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
When I hit Run, here's what the results look like.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And if I want to compare them to what we got from Wikipedia,

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I can go ahead and do that.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Here you can see we have 2 columns.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
These are the results as computed by our random sampling,

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and these are the results as computed by exact math

53
00:02:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
as shown in Wikipedia, and you can see they're pretty close in all cases.
