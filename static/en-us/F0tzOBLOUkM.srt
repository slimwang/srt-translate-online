1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,340
So now that you know how to support the view

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,160
port meta, lets poke around in the developer tools to

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,910
see what we need to do to fix this page.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,710
Now, the biggest problem here is that the page has

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,900
a fixed column width. If I resize the window, you'll

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,300
notice the column of text doesn't actually change size, just

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,040
margin position. As we mouse around the elements inside the

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,810
dev tools, we can pretty quickly find, the first offending element.

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,890
This page element here actually has a width set

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,390
on it. Let's disable that and see what happens. Well,

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,360
it certainly changed things, but I don't think that

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,050
it actually improved things very much. Let's keep digging inside

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,390
the content and see what we can find. This

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,540
wrapper element has a width of 100% already. Which is

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,630
good. It means that it's not preventing us from

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,020
resizing. But this content element does have a width set

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,000
in pixels. Let's disable that. Now as we resize

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,880
the page our content is fine but the sidebar is

19
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,060
appearing and disappearing. Sure enough, it has a width set.

20
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,650
If we set its width as a percentage also, now

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,550
we're resizing a little bit better. So now let's

22
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,050
go back up to the page, and let's try giving

23
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,400
it a width but let's give it a width in

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,370
view port units instead, now our only remaining problem seems

25
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,280
to be that the header is actually not resizing as

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,900
we want it to let's go take a look at

27
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,770
the header image again. The image has a max width

28
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,910
set, but not just a width. So, let's set its width.

29
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,530
And now, everything seems to be resizing well. Now, this isn't perfect,

30
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,570
but all that I really wanted to get at was that as you

31
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,930
try to transition pages from fixed layout to fluid layout, The core

32
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,710
things to look for, are fixed pixel sizes and lack of percentage resize.
