00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,301
Problem solving is extremely important to us, because not a day goes by that we

2
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:07,962
don't have to implement some type of problem solving strategy. Every test we do

3
00:00:07,962 --> 00:00:12,260
that we don't necessarily know how to do forces us to solve a problem. There

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,152
are many strategies to solve different kinds of problems. For example, basic

5
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:21,700
mathematical problems use algorithms. And algorithms are step by step formulas

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:27,222
or procedures used to solve a problem. For example, you use an algorithm when

7
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:32,049
you're trying to do long division. These step by step procedures work really

8
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,452
well when there's a clear, yet unknown solution to a problem, these kinds of

9
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:40,852
problems are called, convergent problems. They have a known solution and your

10
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:46,393
thinking has to converge or narrow down on the correct solution. Other problems

11
00:00:46,393 --> 00:00:51,746
have no known solution, or many different solutions. These are called Divergent

12
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:55,909
problems. This requires thinking that broadens and diverges to come up with a

13
00:00:55,909 --> 00:01:01,611
possible solution. Now for these kinds of problems, A good strategy to use is

14
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:07,208
insight or the Eureka strategy. This involves lots of thinking, you might be

15
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:10,897
stumped for a little while, put the problem aside for a little while. Then all

16
00:01:10,897 --> 00:01:14,486
of a sudden the solution will just hit you. The problem to this, is it can't be

17
00:01:14,486 --> 00:01:16,753
taught, like algorythms can.
