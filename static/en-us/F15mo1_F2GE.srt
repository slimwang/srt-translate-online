This lecture has presented an architectural design process using the text

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,490
browser as a case study. The main result is a breakdown of system functionality

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,240
into components. Also, the components are assigned responsibility for

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,920
maintaining important system invariants. However, we haven't yet dealt with with

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,810
the non-functional requirements, which is a major concern of software,

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,350
software architectural design. We will address this issue in a later lesson.
