1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,220
So we're going to create two buttons.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,150
One with the text load interstitial, and

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,900
one with the text
interstitial not ready.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,210
Let's first look at the layout
file where these are defined.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,340
So this is going to be in
the interstitial activity.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,400
So we open the activity_interstitial
layout file here.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,050
Here you can see a linear
layout that has two buttons.

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,750
The first button is our load button.

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,660
It has the text Load Interstitial.

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,920
And when we click on the button the
loadInterstitial method will be called.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,390
The second button is the one
showing Interstitial Not Ready.

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,780
And when this button is called, the
showInterstitial method will be called.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,980
And as you can see, I haven't
really hard coded the text here.

14
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,890
These are actually string
resources that we'll define in

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,020
our string resource file.

16
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,900
So if we look at the definition
of these constants,

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,120
we go into our Strings resource file.

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,352
The interstitial_load constant
is set to Load Interstitial.

19
00:00:57,352 --> 00:01:01,360
The interstitial_not_ready constant
is set to Interstitial Not Ready.

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,780
I've also defined a constant called
interstitial_loading that I set to

21
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,270
Loading Interstitial.

22
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,380
We'll use that later in our code.

23
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,490
Here you can also see that we have
defined the interstitial_ad_unit_id.

24
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,170
This will be the ad unit id that
we use for our interstitial ad.

25
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,950
And as you can see,
I've hard coded it to this string here,

26
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,750
which is the string you can use
to display test interstitial ads.

27
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,820
Similar to this constant up here which
is the test ad unit id for banner ads.

28
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,400
All right, so

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,390
now when we have our layout file in
order, lets look at the actual code.

30
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,960
So we go into the interstitial
activity java file.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,035
So first of all you can see that
we've added a member, mShowButton.

32
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,450
And in onCreate we call
our parent's onCreate.

33
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,370
Then, we set the content
view to the layout file

34
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,660
of the interstitial activity,
the one we just looked at.

35
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,840
We find the button using,

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,820
findViewById, providing the showButton
in the layout file as an argument.

37
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,570
And then we disable this button.

38
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,080
When the Load Interstitial
button is clicked, we,

39
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,120
again, disable the show button.

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,770
And then we change its text
to Loading Interstitial.

41
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,440
And, as you can see, this text is also
something we've defined in our resource

42
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,890
file, the interstitial_loading
resource we just looked at.

43
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,205
So we get this string resource
using getResources and getString.

44
00:02:28,205 --> 00:02:31,775
And for now the show interstitial
callback will be empty.

45
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:35,715
We will add code to this callback later,
but as you can see, this callback

46
00:02:35,715 --> 00:02:40,215
can't even be called right now because
this button is always disabled.
