00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,388
So now let consider any equation of a circle that's centered at the origin. So,

2
00:00:05,388 --> 00:00:09,084
here's a new piece of string. And I'm going to cut it. So that way, I don't

3
00:00:09,084 --> 00:00:15,620
know the radius. So we'll let the length of this string be r. We don't know it.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:22,120
And at this length, we'll represent the radius of our new circle. And remember,

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,216
we can create this circle by plotting all the points of the end of the string.

6
00:00:26,216 --> 00:00:33,682
If we do this, what equation describes this circle? Write that equation here.

7
00:00:33,682 --> 00:00:40,543
Now, if you're a little stumped. Remember that you're centered at the origin.

8
00:00:40,543 --> 00:00:42,904
And any point out here is x, y.
