1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,270
All right, so here we are in Android
Studio looking at our source code for

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,660
the main activity.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,810
Let's go ahead and look at
the AsyncTask doinBackground method.

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,430
Now if you look closely at the code
here, you'll notice that we're

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,740
converting the string holding
the URL into an actual URL object.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,880
Then in this try catch block,
we go ahead and

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,740
make an HTP request using the URL.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,340
But what's a URL object?

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,630
What's this class?

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,240
Let's go ahead and look at
the Android reference documentation.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,882
As introduced earlier,
URL is an acronym that stand for

12
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:34,602
Uniform Resource Locator and
it identifies the location

13
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:39,187
of an Internet resource which in our
case is a list of earthquake data.

14
00:00:39,187 --> 00:00:43,950
Look at the Soonami app makeHttpRequest
method to see this in action.

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,850
Then answer this quiz question.

16
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,655
What's the data type of
the value returned by calling

17
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:51,090
url.openConnection method?

18
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,390
Write you answer here.
