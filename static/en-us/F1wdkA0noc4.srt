00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,850
Peter is going to teach us about search.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,320
While we already did a lot of
searching in the game playing section,

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,470
most search algorithms
are not adversarial.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,420
Peter, why is search so important in AI?

5
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:13,029
>> Well to me,

6
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:16,640
AI is all about figuring out what to
do when you don't know what to do.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,519
Regular programming is writing
instructions to make the computer

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,259
do what you want when
you do know what to do.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,380
In AI, it's for when you don't know.

10
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:27,629
And search is one of the key areas
where we can figure out what to do

11
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:31,579
by planning a sequence of steps, even
when we have no idea what the first step

12
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:34,299
should be until we solve
the search problem.

13
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:35,953
>> When watching these lessons,

14
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:39,023
please pay careful attention
to the a-star algorithm.

15
00:00:39,023 --> 00:00:42,290
It is one of the most famous AI
algorithms, and a lot of job

16
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:46,250
interviewers in the field will assume
you're familiar with its concepts.

17
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,789
Let's do a challenge question
to give you a preview

18
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:49,600
of what you'll be learning.
