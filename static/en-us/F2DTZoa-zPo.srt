00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
How did we search before we had computers?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[Mark Weber:] People with clay tablets, which have writing on them, would sometimes have

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
cross-references to other clay tablets.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's kind of the origin of Bing.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Telegraphy--you could send in a query, like to a search engine, as a telegram

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and get it back by post.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There were a lot of people that were thinking about how to use technology to search.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The search engine is basically where you're looking through every word in every document

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that might be up on the web that's accessible to find a match.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's really just the same as if you went into a library ad you spent, in this case,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
it would take days to sit there and go through every page of book,

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
looking for all the occurrences of--I don't know--the word "aardvark."

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Obviously, that's something that's really painful to do in the real world,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
but powerful computers can make that so fast

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that it actually becomes a reasonable way to search for information.
