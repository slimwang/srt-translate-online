00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,920
In this lesson, you'll use Salesforce to quickly visualize your data using

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,119
charts, reports and dashboards. Sam and Andy are going to help you with that.

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,050
>> So, it seems like if you're a music festival manager, there

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,440
are a ton of opportunities for visually conveying information to other people.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,650
>> Totally. I mean, with all of the

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,680
different things that you're tracking, maybe you want to track

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,170
things that are over time, or maybe you

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,760
want to track just the distribution of a specific thing.

00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,570
>> Like VIP

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,720
tickets versus general admission, or money over time, or something like that.

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,920
>> Exactly, and just like whenever

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,860
you're charting anything, there are different types

13
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,130
of charts that you might want to use in order to display that information.

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:35,480
>> Yeah.

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,210
>> Or, maybe we just want to create reports on it.
