In the last lesson, we looked at the logs that I had written here, and I asked

2
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:08,448
you to see if you could come up with any links between the numbers. Now that

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:11,044
you've had a chance to think about that for awhile, I'd like to give you a

4
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:15,445
chance to document your thoughts. Please write in this box any ideas you have

5
00:00:15,445 --> 00:00:19,166
about the connection between the numbers we've input into the logs in the

6
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:24,316
numbers that are output. Also just to remind you, these three numbers right

7
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:27,768
here are rounded. So this is just a chance for you to make a guess and it's not

8
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:29,289
going to be graded.
