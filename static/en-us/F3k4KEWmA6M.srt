00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,470
So let's talk about a quiz that's
sort of revisits this idea of

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,578
a vulnerability and resulting in this
exploit that we are talking about.

3
00:00:09,578 --> 00:00:13,900
So we know that there is a vulnerability
and what is the reason for

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,455
that vulnerability?

5
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:17,640
That's what we are trying
to answer in this quiz.
