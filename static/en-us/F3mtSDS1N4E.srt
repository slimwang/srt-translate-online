00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,540
After you type it out,
it should look something like this.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,990
Hopefully you also thought about
what each line of code was doing.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,540
This line of code creates a new boolean
variable called hasWhippedCream and

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,740
the initial value is false.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,070
On the next line,
we take that same variable and

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,120
then we update it to have a true value.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,790
And then we update it again
to have a false value.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,030
You can update it as many times as
you want, just like you can update

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,100
the integer or string variables
as many times as you want.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,330
As for use cases, I showed you
a couple on my phone already, so

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,600
hopefully you found some on your own.
