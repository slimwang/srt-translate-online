00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,200
All right, and if you know, if you were paying attention as

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:07,980
we were going through this, these are all very common, and realistic

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,060
things. So, you know these are all true, these are all sources

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,300
of error. And this is why we really need to be careful when

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,940
we fit our data. We don't want to fit the error itself,

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,250
we want to just fit the underlying signal. So let's talk about how

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,847
we might be able to figure that out. How can we, how

8
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:25,587
can we get a handle on what the underlying function really is apart

9
00:00:25,587 --> 00:00:28,780
from the errors and the noise that are, that are in it.
