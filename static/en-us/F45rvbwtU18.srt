1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,000
All right.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,835
So during the last video,
I already showed you how to download

3
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:06,930
androidparty.jpg and
how to move it into the drawable folder.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,670
If you're having difficulty with these
two, go ahead and rewatch the videos, or

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,960
go to the forums and
ask other students for help.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,000
The rest of these,
we're going to go ahead and

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,050
do in Android Studio right now.

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,410
Okay, so this is my happy
birthday application code.

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:25,900
Specifically, I'm looking at the file
activitymain.xml, which is inside of

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,490
the layout folder, right here, so make
sure you're looking at the same file.

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,049
Now one of the things that we needed
to do was remove the padding, and

12
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,870
I showed you how to do this in
the video but I'm going to do it again.

13
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,470
These four attributes right here,

14
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,940
I'm not really interested
in having right now.

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,680
Okay, so that was pretty easy.

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,800
The next I want to do is go ahead and
make another TextView.

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,650
That should be super easy because I
already have a TextView right here that

18
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,610
I can model it off of.

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,268
I'm in fact going to go ahead and
copy this TextView and paste.

20
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:55,830
Now the TextView I'm adding is supposed
to say from, and then your name.

21
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,170
So I'm going to change that right now,
and

22
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,070
I changed this specific attribute
because it's the text attribute.

23
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,230
Okay so
I've done two out of the four things.

24
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,580
Now I'm going to go ahead and
add the ImageView.

25
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,600
Now I don't have an ImageView
to copy off of, so

26
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,610
I'm just going to start typing.

27
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,520
If you don't remember what an ImageView
looks like you can go ahead and

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,610
check out the XML cheat sheet
that we've provided for you.

29
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,150
One of the neat things
that Android Studio does

30
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,290
is when you start typing something it'll
pop up with a little auto-complete menu.

31
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,420
Since what I wanted was an ImageView I'm
going to go ahead and click on it.

32
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,172
Well this is super helpful, because it
gave me the android:layout_width and

33
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:33,980
android:layout_height attributes
without me needing to type them.

34
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,270
I'm going to go ahead right now and

35
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,760
just make these wrap_content
just like the TextViews.

36
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,610
And you can see how I don't even need to
finish typing, I can just click on it.

37
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,430
Okay, now if we go over here and look
at the phone preview, I can see that it

38
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,970
says Happy Birthday and I can just
barely see that it says from Lyla.

39
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,840
So, these two TextViews seem to be
displayed somewhat correctly but

40
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,310
I'm not getting any sort
of image down here.

41
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,060
That's because I still need to define
the source attribute of the image view.

42
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,090
After all, I haven't said what
picture I actually want to show.

43
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,430
So I'm going to go ahead and
start typing that right now.

44
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,890
I'll start with android, again,
the auto complete pops up with src,

45
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,880
so to save on typing I'll go ahead and
click it.

46
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,940
The auto complete even guesses
what should come next.

47
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,880
And if you remember from the lecture,
I need to type @drawable.

48
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,970
Now the question is,
what comes after here?

49
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,560
Well what comes after here is the name
of the picture that I want to display,

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,370
and more importantly that picture
has to exist in the drawable folder.

51
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,630
So over here, inside the rows folder,
inside the drawable folder,

52
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,680
I have androidparty.jpg,
which is the image that I moved over.

53
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,540
This is the image that I want to use.

54
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,160
It's in the correct place.

55
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,200
All I need to do is type the name
without the file extension,

56
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,660
which would be androidparty.

57
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,220
Okay, and almost immediately you
should see that the picture appears.

58
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,090
Now this is looking pretty good,
so great job so far.

59
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,910
But before you move on,
you should always,

60
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,220
always, always,
actually run your app on your phone.

61
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,507
So I'm going to do that by coming
up here to the green run button.

62
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:08,576
And clicking on it, it's going
to think for a little bit, and

63
00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:11,450
I could see that it's
processing down here.

64
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,740
Okay, and once this window pops up,

65
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,650
as long as my phone is plugged into
my computer and everything is set up

66
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:22,090
like we showed before, I should be able
to select the phone, and then hit OK.

67
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,040
Okay, so
this is actually pretty awesome.

68
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,520
Our phone looks a lot like the example
phone that we have down here.

69
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,645
We got ImageView,
we got our two Text Views up here.

70
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,336
And we pretty much confirmed
everything's working as expected at

71
00:03:34,336 --> 00:03:35,200
this point.

72
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,140
Just going through the checklist items
I've added a TextView that says,

73
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,850
From Lyla.

74
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,361
I've also added the androidparty
ImageView right here.

75
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:46,397
I went ahead and
removed that extra default padding and

76
00:03:46,397 --> 00:03:49,050
I click the green arrow and ran my app.

77
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:49,740
Neat.

78
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,470
So at this point you're
ready to move on and

79
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,880
fix this pesky little problem where
our views are overlapping one another.
