1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So the answer here is n,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and to see this, let's start from the second part of the statement.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,500
Let's say that a graph has a Hamiltonian cycle; then that means it can start

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,000
at one vertex and end at another, passing through every vertex on the way.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now if each edge has a length 1, then the shortest tour from one end to the other

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
is going to pass through each of those edges.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And then the shortest tour for the given graph has a length of n.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now let's say instead that we have a shortest tour for a given graph

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
with n vertices, and it has length n, with the stipulation that each edge has length 1.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Then we can simply use that shortest tour as the Hamiltonian cycle and be done.
