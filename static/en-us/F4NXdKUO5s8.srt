00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,780
The answer is, state six and state two. Those are the two

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,660
states in which the vacuum is on the right, and that state

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,490
is dirty. The other state we can't observe, and it could've been

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,100
in any state before, so now it can be either clean or dirty.
