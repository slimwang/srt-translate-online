00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Sometimes objects are behind other objects.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
For example, I can partially cover up this object.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You can probably still recognize it.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Or I might move a pen in front of it, as shown over here.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now we've almost no choices left.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Tell me what type of invariance this was.
