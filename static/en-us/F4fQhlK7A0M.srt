1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,420
At this point, we are done writing our super class in the pseudo classical

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,550
pattern, and instances of car should work as expected.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,220
But now, we need to move on to making our sub classes work.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,750
We start by writing a constructor function for the van sub class.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,560
So here we are building up a new subclass in memory.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,460
And that subclass is supposed to derive a lot of its behavior from

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,140
the superclass Car.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,920
What code do you think we should put insider the Van function?

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,780
Give it a shot. Hint: it's going to involve the loc input variable.
