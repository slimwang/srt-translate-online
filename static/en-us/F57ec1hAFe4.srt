00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,022
We want the code to do the same thing that it did before, but now if there

2
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:05,864
isn't a next double the first time, we want to print an error instead of

3
00:00:05,864 --> 00:00:11,286
collecting values and calculating the sum and the average. So I'll ask the user

4
00:00:11,286 --> 00:00:15,129
to enter a value and then if n has another double, we'll go into the while loop

5
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:20,182
and eventually calculate the average. So I'll indent all of this to put it

6
00:00:20,182 --> 00:00:24,582
inside of this clause. Now if they don't enter a double, I'll catch that with

7
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:28,538
an else clause, I'll print out an error message. Let's check out whether this

8
00:00:28,538 --> 00:00:32,067
worked or not. If I enter a bad value, I get the message I wanted, and if I

9
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:36,210
enter good values, then it calculates the average.
