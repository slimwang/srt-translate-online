Hello, my name is Nick Gustafson, and

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:06,430
I'm a data scientist at Udacity. My background

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,180
is I did my undergrad in neurobiology and

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,430
I went on in graduate school to continue

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,280
studying neurobiology, and neuroscience in particular, and

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,240
kind of, computational neuroscience and looking at algorithmic

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,750
And all mechanisms of learning and decision making.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,420
And while towards that, hm, tail end of

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,970
my graduate work I, eventually kind of realized I did not want to stay

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,480
in academia, however I still have this

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,060
kind of strong passion for analyzing data,

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,950
modeling data, understanding You know, patterns within

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,190
it, and kind of, you know, applying

14
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,790
scientific methods, and data science just, just

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,580
felt like a natural progression from there.
