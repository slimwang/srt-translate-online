1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,612
So what exactly is a StackView?

2
00:00:03,612 --> 00:00:06,929
A StackView is a view that doesn't
display anything by itself.

3
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:11,080
Instead, it organizes
the views it contains.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,259
Even though it uses
Auto Layout under the hood,

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,591
you don't have to directly
mess around with Auto Layout.

6
00:00:15,592 --> 00:00:19,990
The StackView can organize
views in two ways,

7
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:24,929
horizontally as a row of views and
vertically as a column.

8
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:26,859
And that's all there is to it.

9
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:32,219
By combining stack views together, you
can create almost any UI that you need.

10
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:33,829
Such a simple concept.

11
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:38,269
Rows and columns and
all our problems are washed away.

12
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,940
Yet another brilliant example
of Apple's ingenuity at work.

13
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:43,109
Whoever came up with this,

14
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,835
it's obvious that the inspiring
spirit of Steve was with them.

15
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:51,140
>> [APPLAUSE]
>> Actually,

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,265
the whole idea was
borrowed from Android.

17
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:57,753
>> [LAUGH]
