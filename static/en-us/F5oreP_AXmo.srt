1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,920
So let's compare what we can get from
a multicore versus single core processor

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,280
in a new technology.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,580
Suppose that in the previous
technology generation,

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,160
we got a processor that has an area
of two centimeters squared.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,670
It was achieving 2.5
instructions per cycle.

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:24,570
And it consumed 100 W,
at 2 GHz frequency.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,750
And this is the highest power that
we can allow this processor to have.

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,400
And this 100 W is what
we can reasonably call.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,490
Now let's say we get the new technology
where this same exact processor

10
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,500
would be half the area because
our transistors have shrunk.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,864
Because it's the same design,
it's going to have the same IPC.

12
00:00:45,864 --> 00:00:50,941
And because transistors have shrunk,
we also reduce the power

13
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:57,240
of this processor when operating at
the same 2 GHz frequency as before.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,650
Now of course because this processor is
smaller in the new technology than in

15
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,690
the old one.

16
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,600
If we want to do the best we can with 2
centimeter square, we have two options.

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,055
Our first option is a better
single core processor.

18
00:01:10,055 --> 00:01:14,785
This processor will be designed to
occupy the entire area that we have,

19
00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:16,595
which is 2 cm square.

20
00:01:16,595 --> 00:01:22,325
It's a more complicated processor that
allows us to achieve an IPC of 3.5.

21
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:29,000
So it executes 3.5 instructions per
cycle, not 2.5 as the old processor.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,430
But because it's a fancier processor and
has more transistors,

23
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:39,410
it spends 75 W when operating at 2 GHz.

24
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:44,915
So, the question for you is first, if we
allow this processor to spend all 100

25
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:50,200
W that we can call,
what is the frequency it can get in GHz?

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,870
And if we do that, what is
the speedup this better single core

27
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,400
achieves versus what we can
get in the old technology?

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,430
The second option we had
in this new technology

29
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,930
Is to simply put two cores on this chip.

30
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,410
So it's going to be two cores like this.

31
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,960
This is going to get us 2 cm squared.

32
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,090
IPC is going to be 2.5 on each core.

33
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,060
And each core is going to
consume 50 W at 2 GHz.

34
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,250
So we get our entire budget spent by
having these cores operate at 2 GHz.

35
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,330
So the question for you here,

36
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,620
is what's the speedup of this two-core
approach versus the old technology,

37
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,230
assuming, of course, that the old work
can simply be divided among the cores.

38
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,160
So pretty much having two cores
allows us just to split the same work

39
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,940
that we had before onto two cores
without adding any new instructions.

40
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,670
And without sacrificing the IPC.
