1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,150
Now, what is Rice's theorem?

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,310
Rice's theorem is actually quite simple.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,970
Rice's theorem simply says that if you asked for an algorithm

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,300
to decide the program has a functional property and it can be any functional property,

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,210
then, you're looking at an undecidable problem.

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,270
I don't even know, that come out of surprise to you

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,180
after we have shown that basically anything is undecidable.

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,620
It's almost a surprise now that any problem on a computer

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,620
should even be solvable but we'll get into that in a minute.

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,170
The main question, of course, how can you show Rice's theorem,

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,550
and the proof that is actually easy and it follows the same scheme as above here.

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,610
So the proof of this general statement

13
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,900
follows the same scheme that all of our other proofs of undecidability have basically used.

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,050
So, again, we assumed that there is a program that can decide

15
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,800
for another program if that possesses a certain functional property.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,080
So we're given a program P again, any program P,

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,290
and we assumed that no matter what P is,

18
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,080
we can always say "does P have a functional property?"

19
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,550
Now, on the other side, assume that there is another program P',

20
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,769
and what we want to do is solve the halting problem for this program here

21
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,140
and then we'll use the algorithm here that can decide for any program P

22
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,180
if it has a functional property to solve the halting problem

23
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,090
and the way we do this is as follows:

24
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:19,300
We construct a new program we will call program X and this program has only 3 steps.

25
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,440
First, it runs P' then it clears all of the memory,

26
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,260
so basically a fresh start of a machine,

27
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,010
and this is the only reason why we need this condition too here for a functional property

28
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,990
because if we have an algorithm that can decide a functional property,

29
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,380
this means that there are some programs that has this property and others that don't.

30
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,950
So, we will now add to our program X a program that has this functional property.

31
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,610
So, run program with functional property,

32
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,350
and what then do is we take this program X and fitted into this algorithm here.

33
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,730
what you can see now is the following:

34
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,120
If P' here, the problem for which we want to solve the halting problem,

35
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,490
runs smoothly and terminates,

36
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,800
then this program X will have the functional property that we can decide

37
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,880
because it runs this algorithm here and it clears the memory

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,590
and then it runs the program with that functional property.

39
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,280
This is also the reason why time is not a functional property.

40
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,130
That would kind of destroy the proof of Rice's theorem.

41
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,140
But if time is not an issue, then as long as P' finishes,

42
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,880
the program X will have the functional property that we can decide here.

43
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,210
If, on the other hand, P' goes into an infinite loop,

44
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,580
then the program does not have the functional property

45
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,900
because it will never be able to reach these two lines here.

46
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,580
So, deciding the functional property for this new program X here

47
00:02:36,580 --> 99:59:59,999
is the same as solving the halting problem for the original program that we started out.
