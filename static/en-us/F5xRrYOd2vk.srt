1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And this course we are mostly using the computer to do simulations

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
numerically, that is by number crunching.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The major reason for that is that most problems can't be solved

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
by clean equations, unlike school book problems.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The real road is way too complex to do that.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
A second reason is that particularly we have to base our simulations

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
on huge numbers of measurements be it climate's data, be it financial data, be it data from biology,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but the numerically approach also has a series of drawbacks.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In particular, it's very hard to prove general results using numerics.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Is there no way that a particle in some system escapes to infinity?

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You can look at a single trajectory at a time, but you cannot look at an infinite number of trajectories

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and numerical methods almost always introduce discretization errors

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
also known as truncation errors.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
In particular, we have to work with finite steps in time.
