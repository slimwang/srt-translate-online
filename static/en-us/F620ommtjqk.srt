1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,167
I'm John Owens.

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:04,340
I'm an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Davis,

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,336
where I lead a group of amazing graduate students in exploring the frontiers of GPU computing.

4
00:00:09,336 --> 00:00:13,758
And I'm Dave Luebke. I'm a Senior Director of Research at Nvidia where I study 3D graphics,

5
00:00:13,758 --> 00:00:17,511
and I've been working with John and others for many years on expanding the reach of GPUs.

6
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:20,354
This class focuses on parallel computing on the GPU.

7
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:23,269
You'll learn about both the hardware and the software on the modern GPU,

8
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:28,683
and get to work with high end GPUs as you develop a set of image processing tools during the assignments,

9
00:00:28,683 --> 00:00:33,112
such as those that you might find in cool applications such as Photoshop or Instagram.

10
00:00:33,112 --> 00:00:35,318
We think that projects will be both interesting and fun.

11
00:00:35,318 --> 00:00:38,405
But most important, you'll learn how to think about computing in a parallel way.

12
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:41,067
Thinking in parallel is a crucial skill,

13
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:45,239
maybe even the crucial skill as you approach challenging problems in all areas of computing.

14
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,061
All right. So let's get started.
