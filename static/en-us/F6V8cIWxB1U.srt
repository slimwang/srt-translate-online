00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,122
This is the equation in vertex form and the vertex is four comma one. Great

2
00:00:05,122 --> 00:00:10,517
work if you found these two. We simply rewrite this trinomial expression as a

3
00:00:10,517 --> 00:00:16,935
perfect square. X minus four squared equals this polynomial. We keep the factor

4
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:21,792
of 2 in front. and then we just combine the like terms of positive 33 and

5
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:27,870
negative 32 to get positive one. This equation is in vertex form, so here is

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:36,995
our vertex. We have an h value of 4 and a k value of positive 1. So h comma k.

7
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:43,644
Keep in mind that we find the h value by setting this binomial equal to 0. So x

8
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:48,949
would equal positive 4. The k value is simply the number on the end, so it's

9
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:50,553
positive 1.
