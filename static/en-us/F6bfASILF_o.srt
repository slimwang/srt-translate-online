1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,861
This parabola will have a vertex at negative 3, negative 4. 3 units left, and 4

2
00:00:06,861 --> 00:00:12,460
units down. We can start from the basic graph y equals x squared. We know that

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:18,372
that vertex is centered at the origin. If we subtract 4 from this equation we

4
00:00:18,372 --> 00:00:23,736
know that the entire parabola shifts down four units. Essentially all the y

5
00:00:23,736 --> 00:00:28,590
values from the original graph that we had before shifted down four units.

6
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,406
Notice to that the y coordinate of the vertex is now negative 4. And we see

7
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:39,194
this reflected in the equation. We have a negative 4 tacked on to the end. So

8
00:00:39,194 --> 00:00:43,442
we know that the y coordinate of the vertex is negative 4. And to find the x

9
00:00:43,442 --> 00:00:49,112
coordinate of the vertex we take our binomial and we set it equal to 0. Solving

10
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:53,990
for x will get x is equal to negative 3, the x coordinate of our vertex.
