00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,420
Android wear notifications are the
easiest way to get started in the world

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,520
of wearables.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,039
If you've got an Android
app with a notifications,

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,250
they all ready work on the watch.

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,290
If you've all ready enhanced
your notification with actions,

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,590
such as next or previous.

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,030
This is even better, and

8
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,710
also automatically works with
no additional work required.

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,240
You can take things further with Wear's
specific functionality that make

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,800
your notifications even richer
experiences on the wrist.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,700
Stacks, which are like
inbox style notifications,

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,080
now you can deliver multiple
items in a single bundle.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,080
Pages are for showing multiple screens
of information on the same topic.

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,020
But, remember to stay glanceable.

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,970
Replies.

16
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,000
Now replies allow the user to
respond directly from the wearable

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,560
with their voice.
