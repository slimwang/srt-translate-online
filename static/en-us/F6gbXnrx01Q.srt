1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,354
So when we're determining conic sections, we want to look at the equation. We

2
00:00:04,354 --> 00:00:08,575
can tell by the equation whether or not the shape will be a circle, an elipse,

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:13,987
a hyperbola, or a parabola. For the case of circles, they will always have the

4
00:00:13,987 --> 00:00:18,619
same amount of x squared and y squared. Meaning the numbers in front of x

5
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,865
squared and the number in front of y squared will be the same. Even if I change

6
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:28,742
these to 2 I still have a shape of a circle. And changing into 5 I still have a

7
00:00:28,742 --> 00:00:34,044
perfect circle. So let's go back to a perfect circle that has a radius of 10

8
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:39,780
units. We can change this equation to become an ellipse. All we need to do is

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,504
make the coefficients of x squared and y squared different. For example, if I

10
00:00:44,504 --> 00:00:48,596
make this x squared term have a coefficient of four, instead of one, I get an

11
00:00:48,596 --> 00:00:53,293
ellipse. The key idea for circles and ellipses is that there's a positive sign

12
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:58,230
in between the x squared term and the y squared term. The difference between

13
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,106
them is that circles have the same coefficient whereas ellipses, have different

14
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:06,529
coefficients. Here the coefficient of x squared is 4, and here the coefficient

15
00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:12,410
of y squared is 1. We usually just don't list the 1. But notice it's the same

16
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:17,772
exact graph. Now if we want to turn this ellipse into a hyperbola. We'll want

17
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:21,630
to change this addition sign to subtraction. Hyperbolas will always have a

18
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,470
subtraction sign between their x squared term and their y squared term. So,

19
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:33,651
changing this to a minus, we get our hyperbola. Remember, the minus sign is

20
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:37,242
like the knife that cuts open our ellipse and inverts the sides so they point

21
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:42,745
outward. And since our x squared term comes first our hyperbola opens to the

22
00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:47,805
left and to the right. They point in these directions. But let's see what

23
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:51,640
happens when we make the x squared term negative, and the y squared term

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,357
positive. We have subtraction between the squared terms, so we know this graph

25
00:01:56,357 --> 00:02:03,526
will end up being a hyperbola. And look, it is. The only difference is that

26
00:02:03,526 --> 00:02:08,502
now, our hyperbola opens up and it opens down. And that's because the y squared

27
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:14,204
term comes first, it's positive. Whereas, the x squared term is negative. Now,

28
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:18,734
there's one more conic to look at, the parabola. A parabola has x squared or y

29
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:24,775
squared, but it doesn't have both. So in order to change this hyperbola into a

30
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:29,747
parabola let's change y squared into just y. Now, I'm also going to change the

31
00:02:29,747 --> 00:02:34,556
value 100 to 10, so that way we can see the graph on here. And notice, when we

32
00:02:34,556 --> 00:02:40,678
change y squared to y, we get a parabola. The vertex is at zero negative 10,

33
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:45,388
and the parabola opens upward. And here's how you can tell if a parabola will

34
00:02:45,388 --> 00:02:52,090
open up or if it'll open down. We can rearrange this equation and solve for y.

35
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,880
So first I'll subtract negative 4x squared from both sides of this equation.

36
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,967
This gives me negative y on the left, negative 4x squared on the right, and

37
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:07,876
positive 10 on the right. Next I'll multiply every term by negative 1. This

38
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:14,064
will give me 1y equals positive 4x squared minus 10. And we can easily see that

39
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:17,922
all three of these equations represent the same graph. I could graph this one

40
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:23,330
and I could graph this one and see that they all make the same parabola. Since

41
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,795
this parabola is y equals we know its going to open up. Or it's going to open

42
00:03:27,795 --> 00:03:33,860
down. And since the coefficient on the squared term is positive, it opens up.

43
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,085
Now, if we make this coefficient negative, the parabola opens down. So, when

44
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:41,605
determining whether or not something opens up, or something opens down, you

45
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:45,070
want to solve for the single variable first, and then look at the coefficient

46
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:51,540
of the squared term. Is it positive or is it negative. So we've seen a parabola

47
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,320
open up and down but let's see one that opens left and right instead of having

48
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,980
the parabola be y equals let's make it be x equals so we'll make the x term be

49
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:06,630
a single x variable. And the y term be y squared. Doing that we see we get a

50
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,347
sideways parabola and it points to the right and again we know this parabola

51
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:17,320
opens to the right since we can rearrange this equation to be x equals. First

52
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,974
we'll add y squared to both sides so we'll get 4x equals positive y squared on

53
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:27,250
the right. And positive 10 on the right. Next we'll divide every term by 4, to

54
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:32,724
get x equals 1 fourth y squared plus 10 fourth. And when I graph each of these

55
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:36,883
equations, I should see that they're all the same. Since this parabola is in

56
00:04:36,883 --> 00:04:41,876
the form x equals, we know it's going to open to the right or to the left. And

57
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:46,855
since this number, this coefficient is positive 1 fourth. Our graph opens to

58
00:04:46,855 --> 00:04:52,086
the right. If instead we make it negative 1 fourth, our parabola will open to

59
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:58,820
the left. So remember y equal parabolas open up and down. And x equal parabolas

60
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:04,522
open right and left. The sign on the squared term tells us which direction that

61
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:11,837
is. Up and right for positive. Down and left for negative.
