00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,720
The next major upgrade came
with Android 4.4 KitKat.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,990
Which introduced the scenes and
transitions API.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,390
To see what's going on behind the
scenes, let's look at a small example.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,990
When I tap this button the OS
executes a transition and

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,060
needs to do a couple of things.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,100
First, it needs to
capture the starting and

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,490
end state for every view in the scene.

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,810
And create an animator that will
interpolate between the starting

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,950
and end states.

10
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,060
So in this case the end state
is that the image is gone.

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,000
The starting state is that
the image is visible.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,575
So here's the code to slide
a view off the top of the screen,

13
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:40,075
beginDelayedTransition takes a view
group and a transition type.

14
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:44,565
In this case it's the root view and
the slide transition.

15
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:47,785
Immediately after the call
to beginDelayedTransition,

16
00:00:47,785 --> 00:00:51,322
transition calls capture start states.

17
00:00:51,322 --> 00:00:54,232
Which indicated captures
the start save for

18
00:00:54,232 --> 00:00:57,582
all views in the view group
before we've modified them.

19
00:00:57,582 --> 00:01:02,320
After that's done we modify the elements
we want to change or transition.

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,030
When the frame is done, transition
manager calls capture end states,

21
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,350
which does, you guessed it,

22
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,960
stores the end states of all of
the views in the view group.

23
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,200
The transition calles creat animator
with the state and animator set and

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,680
executes it.

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,810
The STK comes with a bunch of
fabricated transitions listed here.

26
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,650
Be mindful that all of them aren't
supported on all versions of Android, so

27
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,710
if you require them you might
be excluding some users.
