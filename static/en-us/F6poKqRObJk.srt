00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,580
Before this quiz starts,
I want to talk testing strategy.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,350
First off, you want to make sure
that you're collecting clean data.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,500
So, you should first quit any
other apps that you have running

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,090
besides the browser.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,660
Along the same lines,
extensions can skew your results.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,020
So, make sure you're running your
tests in an incognito window.

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,980
You should also recognize that
sometimes you may have several

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,350
bottlenecks in your code, and

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,730
they may be triggered in different ways
from different parts of the pipeline.

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,880
So, it's important that you focus on
the causes of bottlenecks more than you

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,450
focus on their symptoms.

12
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,470
And lastly, with any performance issue,
make sure you always measure first,

13
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,550
before you start to apply fixes.

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,930
There's no point in fixing
an issue you don't actually have.

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,730
And you won't be able to know how
well your fixes actually work

16
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,220
unless you've measured first, so
that you can compare the difference.

17
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,570
All right.
Well, now it's time for

18
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,550
you to practice your def tool skills and

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,794
take a timeline recording of the website
linked in the instructor notes.

20
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:54,894
Limit the timeline to just scripting.

21
00:00:54,894 --> 00:00:56,304
And then start recording.

22
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:58,314
Click on the Switch Layout button and
then,

23
00:00:58,314 --> 00:01:02,794
see if you can figure out where
the jank was caused inside the code.

24
00:01:02,794 --> 00:01:04,244
Type your answer into this box.
