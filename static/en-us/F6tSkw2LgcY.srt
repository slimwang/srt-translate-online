00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,410
Hi, welcome to lesson two.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,780
In the first lesson, you learned what version control is and

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,120
how Git compares to other systems.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:07,650
In this lesson,

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,790
you'll learn how to use Git on your own machine for solo projects.

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,870
You'll learn how to create a new repository and make commits.

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,520
You'll also learn what it means to merge and branch in Git and

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,490
how to use these tools to keep track of experimental changes to your project.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,390
Then in lesson three, we'll learn how to use Git collaboratively across multiple

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,350
machines using GitHub.

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:28,890
Let's get started.
