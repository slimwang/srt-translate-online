1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,928
And the answer is that Y1
should be 3 and Y2 should be 0.

2
00:00:04,928 --> 00:00:07,980
From looking at the bound we see
that we want them both to be small.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,310
And looking at the constraints
we see that the non negativity

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,830
implies that this one
will always be met.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,510
So we can more or
less ignore that constraint.

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,620
An increase in Y2 here actually
enforces us to increase Y1 as well.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:29,894
So it should be clear that Y2 is zero,
and from that it follows that Y1 is 3.

8
00:00:29,894 --> 00:00:33,459
Now you might have used some reasoning
like that, or you could have recognized

9
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:37,670
that what you were doing here was
really solving another linear program.

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,900
I asked you to minimize
a linear function subject

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,450
to a set of linear constraints and
the non-negativity of the variables.

12
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,590
This, then, is the essence of duality.

13
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,990
In trying to obtain a tight
bound on one linear program,

14
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,280
we end up with another one.
