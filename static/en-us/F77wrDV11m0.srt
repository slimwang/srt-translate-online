1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Resegmented market--well, you have a hypothesis about who the customers are--

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
that is you think you understand what your fit is, either in the low cost

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
or there are specific in each needs and so you might have a better fit for them.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And competitors, there's many if you're wrong but very few if you're right,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and your risk is that you get the market and product redefinition just wrong.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You didn't do enough customer discovery and you say--

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
"No, no, no. This is how we're going to enter this existing market.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We're going to go after these set of usuals specifically," and oops, you are wrong.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A great example of this is what Southwest did.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Southwest took on the airline industry by bringing up the traditional hub-and-spoke model

11
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and providing just very limited services but for an extremely low price.
