1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,894
It turns out that that something else is the square root of 2. When we multiply

2
00:00:03,894 --> 00:00:09,190
the square root of 2 by the square root of 2, we get the number 2. We know this

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:14,666
is true since we can rewrite this as the square root of 2 squared. We use our

4
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:18,915
knowledge of fractional exponents to rewrite this radical as 2 to the 1 half.

5
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:23,140
We're raising a power to a power so we multiply these exponents together to get

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,259
2 times 1 half, or 2 divided by 2. This leaves us with 2 to the 1, which is

7
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:32,252
simply 2. Now, we're not so much interested in multiplication of radicals right

8
00:00:32,252 --> 00:00:37,140
now, we'll run that later. But what we are interested in is the square root 2.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,745
This is an irrational number. And the irrational number is a number that

10
00:00:40,745 --> 00:00:45,922
doesn't terminate. It means that whatever is after the decimal never ends. The

11
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:50,743
square root of 2 is about 1.4, but that's just an approximation. This decimal

12
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:54,241
actually has an infinite number of places following the decimal point, it goes

13
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:58,394
on forever. So, when we think about irrational numbers, we're just thinking

14
00:00:58,394 --> 00:01:02,482
about numbers that can't be written as a fraction. It's not important to plug a

15
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:05,298
number like the square root of 2 into your calculator since we really only get

16
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:09,641
an approximation of that answer. Throughout the rest of this unit, we won't be

17
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:14,820
working with these crazy decimals. Instead, we'll just write the radical symbol

18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,343
and the number.
