I know the question was a bit ambiguous,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,220
but if you draw a best line through the data points, I would

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,800
say these things over here are the two boxes that best represent the line.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,630
Obviously, not those two over here,

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,450
because that is not a good approximation of the data.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,900
Neither are those over here.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,540
Neither are those over here.

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,860
So, I wanted you to click on those two points over here.
