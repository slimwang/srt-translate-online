00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:04,571
So I had a company that made
basically custom audio D.S.P. for

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:09,476
musical applications and I sold that and
I was kind of semi retired and

3
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:14,228
I was messing around with iOS apps
that were again audio oriented.

4
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:17,952
And I met Oliver who's the V.P. end here
and he was working on apps as well and

5
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:21,469
he came out here to Silicon Valley and
started a company called Origami.

6
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:25,287
And I've been kind of out of the game
for a while and was interested and so he

7
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:29,228
hired me into that startup and I moved
my family out here to Silicon Valley and

8
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:33,231
then that startup got acquired by Nest
and then this got acquired by Google and

9
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:36,123
I left Google about a year ago
to come here to Utah City and

10
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:37,750
head up the engineering team.
