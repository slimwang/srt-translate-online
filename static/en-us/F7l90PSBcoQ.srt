00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now, how about we switch the order of the y from 3, 5, 8 to 8, 5, 3?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The mean stays the same, but several of these values over here change.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And before I compute it, let me again test your intuition.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Is r larger than 0? r = 0? Or r smaller than 0? Pick one.
