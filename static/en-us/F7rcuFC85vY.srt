00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,080
So today we've talked about version spaces. Version spaces are an algorithm for

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,560
converging onto an understanding of a concept, even in the absence of prior

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,180
background knowledge or an intelligent teacher. We covered the algorithm for

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,790
version spaces, where we iteratively refine a general and

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,750
specific model of a concept, until they converge down onto one another.

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,500
We then talked about using version spaces to address more complex problems.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,700
We've also connected version spaces to older concepts, like incremental concept

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,170
learning. Finally we talked about the limitations of version spaces,

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,930
such as what to do if there's no single correct concept, or what to do in

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,010
the absence of either positive or negative examples. To address these, we also

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,915
covered identification trees, which are a different ways of approaching the same

12
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:42,080
kind of data that version spaces operate on. We'll touch on version spaces and

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,000
incremental concept learning again, when we talk about mistake based learning.
