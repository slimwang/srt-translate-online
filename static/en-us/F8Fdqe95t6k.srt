1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,130
You're going to start by practicing
identifying errors when creating

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:03,670
new variables.

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,490
Now if you want to use some technical
verbage, what your actually doing is

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,380
finding errors with declaring and
initializing variables.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,940
Declaring your variable means
creating a new variable.

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,100
It's like making the box for
a variable, and it looks like this.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,020
Right now, there's no value involved,
it's just the data type, the name,

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,580
and a semi colon.

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,830
Initializing on the other hand, is when
you set an initial value for a variable.

10
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,640
It's that act of putting
something inside the box.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,400
And in code it looks like this.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,820
Total = 10.

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,460
Now oftentimes you'll combine the two,
both declaring and initializing and

14
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,760
write a code statement
like int total =10.

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,160
This both creates the box and

16
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,750
puts the value inside
the box all in one statement.

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,100
So you're going to be looking
at statements like these,

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,580
which either are both a declaration and
an initialization or

19
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,780
just a declaration and
identifying when an error has been made.

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,990
Now, these errors are bad enough that
they're considered compile time errors.

21
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,360
And what this means is that Android
Studio won't even let you run your code,

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,700
because it can't understand
what you're trying to say.

23
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,770
Let's take a look at an example
of what the Part 1 problems

24
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,450
are going to look like.

25
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,030
Okay, so this is the first
of the Part 1 problems,

26
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,130
and I'm just going to walk
you through it a little bit.

27
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,400
Okay, so the problem states,
unreadEemails is a variable storing

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,120
the number of unread emails for
an inbox app.

29
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,780
And we're going to go ahead and
assume that there are ten unread emails.

30
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,285
So now you're going to look
at these three different

31
00:01:21,285 --> 00:01:23,960
initializations/declarations.

32
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,020
Some or all of these will have errors.

33
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,120
You're just looking at
the single line by itself.

34
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,500
This is not a block of code.

35
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,620
So you'll look at the first one and
decide whether it's properly written

36
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,660
in a way that it both declares and
initializes the variable unreadEmails.

37
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,100
If it does move on to the next one.

38
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,260
And if you don't think it does then put
a check right here in this check box.

39
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,690
Now if it has an error I also
want you to come over here and

40
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,680
describe what you think
is causing the error.

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,860
Okay but i'm not necessarily saying
this one has an error that was just for

42
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,850
an example.

43
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,940
Okay, so you'd go through these and

44
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,800
check the ones that you
think have problems and

45
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,710
then describe what the errors are here.

46
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,470
If you'd like,
I've provided the code for

47
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,540
each of these exercises in
the instructor notes below.

48
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,000
So you can try copying them over,
one at a time, and

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,729
putting them into the app that
you just created for yourself.

50
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,990
Once you're done, I highly encourage
you to go through the solution video.

51
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,170
I'll explain the logic behind
which ones had errors.
