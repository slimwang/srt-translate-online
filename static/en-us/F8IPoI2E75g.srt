00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,860
Did you know each Boeing 747 has
more than 170 miles of wiring?

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,710
These are extremely complex machines
with a variety of redundant systems.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,090
Navigation, pressurization,
air quality, and so much more.

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,318
All of these systems go
through a number of tests.

5
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:21,080
But did you know, that there are some
test that no airplane has ever passed?

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,647
When airplane manufacturers
design a plane,

7
00:00:23,647 --> 00:00:26,293
they design the structure
of the wings to flex.

8
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:29,569
The manufacturer expects that
a particular design will flex enough to

9
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:32,330
withstand any turbulence
the plane may experience.

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,978
But when they test this design,

11
00:00:33,978 --> 00:00:37,104
do you think they only flex
the wings enough to pass the test?

12
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,558
Nope, they continue to put
pressure on the wings,

13
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:42,270
flexing them until
the wing break right off.

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,710
It's a test that cannot be passed,
failure is the only option.

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,016
The important part is they defined
an expectation and they validated it.

16
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:52,930
That's all a test is, validating
an expectation about something.

17
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,656
During this course, I want you to
think about testing in this way.

18
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:59,047
Failing a test is not bad,
test failure tells you something, and

19
00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:01,710
will help you build bug
free apps with confidence.
