1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,556
The greatest common factor of variable expressions works just the same as it

2
00:00:04,556 --> 00:00:09,125
does with numbers. The greatest common factor or GCF is simply the product of

3
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:13,882
the lowest power of each number factor and variable factor that appears in every

4
00:00:13,882 --> 00:00:18,619
term. So what do you think would be the greatest common factor for 45 x squared

5
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,047
y cubed and 36 x to the fourth y squared z?
