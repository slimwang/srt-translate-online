1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,609
So what's an incubator?

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:04,805
So, incubators have been around for
a long time.

3
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:10,480
Idea Lab, back in the early 2000s and
1990s was one of the first ones.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,910
And what incubators are,
it's a group or kind of an organization

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,300
that has their own ideas, but
they need teams to build those ideas.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,977
So in a sense what you're doing in
an incubator is you're going to work for

7
00:00:23,977 --> 00:00:27,792
a holding company that has ideas and
you're going in building those ideas.

8
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:32,139
Now if the ideas take off and
that business becomes successful,

9
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:36,094
then they spin out and
then they become a private company.

10
00:00:36,094 --> 00:00:38,784
But initially, you're going to work for
somebody else.

11
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:40,374
You're working on their idea, and

12
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,610
you're trying to get to a point where
it can eject from this mother ship.
