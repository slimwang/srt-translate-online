00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's dive in a little deeper into this whole concept of edges.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,010
But let's now look at images and derivatives of images.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,950
So I'd like to define an edge basically as a point in an image, pixel or

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,560
group of pixel but there is a rapid change in the im, image intensity function.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,200
So basically again we want to look at, the image intensities, at a three

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,850
pixel value, in a discrete form or in a function across the function itself.

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,230
And look for where there is any kind of rapid change.

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,420
Significant change.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,730
Again the rapid change will somewhere where the threshold value will come in.

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,670
Small gradual change will be a few pixels, but also not just looking at

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,700
how one pixel to the other but a significant size of the neighborhood.

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,530
Just to keep things simple we're going to look at just the one

13
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,870
slice through this image.

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,210
This is a sample image that we will play with here.

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,170
And if I was to just construct of course,

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,400
the slice of this intensity, I would get this.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,360
So in essence, as I traverse through an image, the intensity is high.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,410
Where this grey values are.

19
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,870
Goes down to a little whole number but it's darker and then comes back up.

20
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,950
So this is basically, on this slice is the intensity map.

21
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,330
Here's what we want to do to this now data here, this the intensity map.

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,090
We want to actually just do a simple difference operation on it.

23
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,430
That is I want to take, for example, this value and

24
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,020
difference it from the next one coming after it.

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,800
And then similarly I want to basically each and

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,140
every value, I want to difference it from the previous one.

27
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,650
This is basically a simple first derivative by just doing simple differences.

28
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,550
And if you look at this, and actually if you look at this kind of stuff here

29
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,200
too, there is of course no changes here, and all of a sudden, many comes here.

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,740
There is a significant change.

31
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,230
This would of course when you look at it in difference form,

32
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,170
would give you this change of course.

33
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:50,380
When it gets here, it basically goes back to zero again, no change.

34
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,170
Another way to look at it, this would be for

35
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,210
example the slope of this line, the slope of this line is zero.

36
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:01,030
All of a sudden the slope goes from zero to a larger number and

37
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,920
then of course goes back to zero again.

38
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,280
So when you notice here, goes to larger number, goes back to zero.

39
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,895
Similarly when we come back to here, it's this way and again the slope changes.

40
00:02:11,895 --> 00:02:14,520
End of this line again, comes back to zero.

41
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,760
So if you notice this is an interesting phenomenon,

42
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,670
that we will actually now capture.

43
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,540
This point here is basically an output of information that

44
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,440
cames from this region here.

45
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,260
And this region here was captured by this point.

46
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:37,250
So if you notice now, is, these extrema points refer to this edge, and

47
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,835
this extrema point refers to this edge.

48
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:44,470
We'll only look for derivatives in x, and these are the two edges.

49
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,015
But there's a rapid change.

50
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:49,090
As I traverse this way on the image.

51
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,392
Of course, using this now edges,

52
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:54,820
we would be able to find something that would always be similar.

53
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,515
Even if I actually took the image of this one slightly moved around to

54
00:02:58,515 --> 00:03:01,120
a next part, or if this was translated in some way.
