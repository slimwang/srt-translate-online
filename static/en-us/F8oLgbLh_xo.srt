1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,444
>> Alright, so Michael. Last set of features that that's come up

2
00:00:03,444 --> 00:00:06,220
with three or four, three or four more features and then move on.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:06,490
>> Sure.

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,110
>> So come up with a couple.

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,460
>> Alright, so I could, sometimes I'll look at the menu that's

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,800
posted outside, and I'll see if the, you know? How pricey it is.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,110
>> Okay, so cost. Right, so cost can be represented as discrete

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,359
input. By the way, it could also be represented as an actual number.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,580
Right? We could say, look it's cheap, it's moderately

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,970
expensive, it's really expensive or you could have a number

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,650
which is the average cost of an entrÃ©e. And it

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,850
doesn't really matter for, for what we're talking about now

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,270
but just some way of representing cost. Okay. Just

14
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,750
give me one or two more features but I want

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,970
to give me some features that don't have anything to

16
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,220
do with the restraunt itself but might still be important.

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:47,810
>> Hmm.

18
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,320
>> because, by the way, hot date probably doesn't have anything to

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,130
do with the restaurant itself. So, even though we've

20
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,240
been talking the features of the restaurant. We've actually

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,670
been picking up, at least, one feature that doesn't

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,820
have anything to do directly with the restaurant itself.

23
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,530
>> Not to. So, whether I'm hungry?

24
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,459
>> I like that. Here's another one.

25
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,630
What's the weather like. Is it raining outside?

26
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,180
>> Which is a different sense of atmosphere.

27
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,992
>> Right. because if it's raining outside, maybe it's not

28
00:01:12,992 --> 00:01:15,360
your, your favorite choice but you don't want to walk anymore.

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,750
Okay, so we have a ton of features here. We've gone

30
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,870
through a few of them. Notice that some of the specifically have

31
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,390
to do with the restaurant and some of them have to do

32
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,710
with things that are external to the restaurant itself but you can

33
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,790
imagine that they're all important. Or possibly important to whether you

34
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,470
should enter into the restaurant or not. Agreed? And there's a bunch

35
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,650
of features you could imagine coming up with that probably have nothing

36
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,800
to do with whether you should enter into the restaurant or not.

37
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,700
Like, how many cars are currently parked across the country.

38
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,020
Probably doesn't have an impact on whether you're going to

39
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,670
enter into a specific restaurant or not. Okay. So, we

40
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,850
have a whole bunch of features and right now we're sticking

41
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,700
with features we think that might be relevant. And we're

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,420
going to use those to make some kind of decision. So,

43
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,910
that gets us to decision trees. So, the first thing,

44
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,900
that, that we want to do is, we want to separate

45
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,669
out what a decision tree is from the

46
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,840
algorithm that you might use to build the decision

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,805
tree. So the first thing we want to think about is the fact that a decision tree

48
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:17,780
has a specific representation. Then only after we

49
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,860
understand that representation and go through an example, we'll

50
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,600
start thinking about an algorithm for finding or

51
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,980
building a decision tree. Okay, are you with me?

52
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,130
>> Yeah.

53
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,730
>> Excellent. Okay, so a decision tree is a very simple thing.

54
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,750
Well, you might be, might be surprised to know it's a tree, the first part of

55
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:43,870
it. And it looks kind of like this. So, what I've drawn for you is example.

56
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,080
Sample generic, decision tree. And what you'll see

57
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,970
is three parts to it. The first thing

58
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,930
you'll see is a circle. These are called

59
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,630
nodes, and these are in fact, decision nodes. So,

60
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:02,040
what you do here, is you pick a particular attribute. [NOISE]

61
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,450
And you ask a question about it. The answer to that question, which is its

62
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,250
value for what the edges represent in your tree. Okay. So we have these nodes

63
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,480
which represent attributes, and we have edges

64
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,570
which represent value. So let's be specific about

65
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,530
what that means. So here's a particular attribute

66
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,530
we might pick for the top node here.

67
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,070
Let's call it hungry. That's one of the features

68
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,720
that Michael came up with. Am I hungry or

69
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,220
not? And there's only two possible answers for that.

70
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,460
yes, I'm hungry, true, or false, I am not hungry.

71
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,240
And each of these nodes represent some

72
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,630
attribute. And the edges represent the answers

73
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,040
for specific values. So it's as if I'm making a bunch of decisions by asking

74
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,650
a series of questions. Am I hungry? And if the answer is yes, I am

75
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,870
hungry, then I go and I ask a different question. Like is it rainy outside?

76
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:03,030
And maybe it is rainy and maybe it's not rainy, and let's say if it isn't rainy

77
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,750
then I want to make a decision, and so these square boxes here are the

78
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,790
actual output. Okay so it's hungry, so you're hungry, yes, and it's not

79
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:18,410
raining, so what do you do? So, let's just say you go in.

80
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,080
True, I go in so, when it's, I'm hungry and it's not raining, I go in.

81
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,870
>> And that, that true is answering a different question. It's not in the

82
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,990
nodes I guess. So, in the leaves, the t and f means something different.

83
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,910
>> That's right. It's the out, that's exactly right. The,

84
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,300
the leaves, the little boxes, the leaves of your decision

85
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,020
tree is your answer. What's on the on the edges

86
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,830
are the possible values that your attribute can take on.

87
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,030
So, in fact, let's try to, let's make that clear by picking a different

88
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,250
by picking another possible attribute. You could

89
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,490
imagine that if I am not hungry, what's

90
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,510
going to matter a lot now is say, the type of restaurant, right. Which we

91
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,830
said there were many, many types of

92
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:08,412
restaurants. So, you know thai, I forget [CROSSTALK]

93
00:05:08,412 --> 00:05:09,662
>> Italian.

94
00:05:09,662 --> 00:05:11,450
>> Italian, and

95
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:11,930
you know, something.

96
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:12,430
>> French fries.

97
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,450
>> And French Fries. So if I'm not hungry, then

98
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,540
what matters a lot more is the type of restaurant,

99
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,060
and so I'll move down this path instead and start

100
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,930
asking other questions. But ultimately, no matter how I, what

101
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,860
this decision tree allows me to do is to ask

102
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,330
a series of questions and depending upon those answers, move

103
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,670
down the tree, until eventually I have some particular ouput

104
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,490
answer, yes I go in the resteraunt, or no I do

105
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:36,600
not

106
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,640
>> Ok this is still seeming a little abstract to me,

107
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,810
can we, can we maybe work through a very concrete example.

108
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,030
>> Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense.

109
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,630
>> Let's do a quiz.

110
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,690
>> Ha, okay, let's do a quiz.
