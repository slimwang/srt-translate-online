1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,700
Now that we have talked about
number of defenses against

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,780
buffer overflow attacks,
let's look at some questions that

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,790
help us understand what these defenses
can do for us and what they cannot.

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,765
So the defenses that we talked
about included stack canaries,

5
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:19,410
address based loud randomization.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,990
So, the first two questions about that,
and the third question is whether

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,760
a certain buffer overflow vulnerability,
read only kind in this case,

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,290
would be avoided, or would go away, when
we can't execute code off the stack.

9
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,720
So look at the defenses and
what they can do for

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,820
the kind of exploits we
talked about before, and

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,110
once you have a chance to do that we'll
come back and talk with the answers.
