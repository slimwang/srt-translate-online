00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,370
The specific objectives
of this lesson are, one,

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,300
we'll talk a little bit about
the concept of Epsilon Photography,

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,570
and how we can go from that
concept to Coded Photography.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,220
We'll talk, really,

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,440
in much more detail about the concept
of Coded Photography itself.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,350
And we'll talk about coded aperture, and
a flutter shutter camera, two specific

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,990
types of camera that actually can do a
little bit more than a standard camera.

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,644
Of course, both these cameras are
examples of computational cameras that

9
00:00:26,644 --> 00:00:30,660
very interested building for
those support computational photography.

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,640
Both of these, the coded aperture
camera, and the flutter shutter camera

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,490
are computational cameras that
are partly what we have thinking of,

12
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,110
when we talk about controllable
cameras can be used to capture

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,160
images to support the computational
photography pipeline.
