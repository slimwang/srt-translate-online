1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,780
For example, if the original title is Gone With the Wind, a good Atlanta title

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,220
to, to deal with, then there are then there are circular shifts for

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,300
it, for them, one for each of the words in the title.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,430
And we've indicated them here by underlining the word that we're shifting.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,720
So we have Gone with the Wind, and with the Wind Gone, and

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,870
the Wind done Gone, no, the Wind Gone with.

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,250
Okay, and the Wind Gone with the.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,310
And if we wanted to look up using any of those words we

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,230
could because now we've indexed on it.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,850
And when we alphabetize it, we have the one starting with gone and

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,010
then the the and the wind and with.
