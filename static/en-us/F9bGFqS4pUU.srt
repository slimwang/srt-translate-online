1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,310
There was so
much complicated stuff in this level.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,140
You learned all about the structure
of a lib GDX game, and

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,420
now you can draw whatever you want.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,500
However, you may have noticed
that what we've drawn so

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,070
far, doesn't really adapt to
screens of different sizes.

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,610
So in the next level,
we'll learn a few more drawing commands,

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,690
but, more importantly we'll
make our game world scale

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,200
to what ever size device
our player is using.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,700
See you there.
