1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,089
So Carl, you've been at Google for
awhile now.

2
00:00:02,089 --> 00:00:03,670
>> Six years.
>> And it sounds like.

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,560
Wow six years.

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,390
And it sounds like prototyping
has changed over that time.

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,080
Can you just sort of talk a little
bit about how that's happened?

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,670
>> Yeah, prototyping has evolved
quite a bit in my tenure at Google.

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,940
When I first came to search, for
instance, almost three years ago,

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,140
we were focused heavily on creating
web products specifically for

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,538
their desktop users.

10
00:00:23,538 --> 00:00:30,350
Google's shift has grown significantly
over the last few years.

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,259
And we've gone mobile first.

12
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,160
And so as a result, I've had to evolve
with the times and have also shifted

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,685
my development practices towards
doing full time Android development.

14
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:42,500
>> Mm-hm.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,380
So you now sort of lead
a team of Android developers.

16
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,500
>> That's right.
So I lead a team of four people,

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,214
specifically looking at search, map and
identity products across Google.

18
00:00:53,214 --> 00:00:54,450
>> Awesome.

19
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,820
And I know you've worked on some
things in their earlier stages,

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,310
that's one of the joys of prototyping,

21
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,630
you get to see these things before they
happen and some of them never do happen.

22
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,754
But can you tell me a little
about working on material design?

23
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:09,542
>> Sure, material design was a fantastic
project to work on, we spent about

24
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:13,282
a year ramping up on that before we
ever released anything to the public.

25
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:18,436
I think in its infancy we were thinking
about it, we called it quantum paper,

26
00:01:18,436 --> 00:01:23,511
and we were really thinking about this
idea that it was digital paper, and so

27
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:28,780
we were thinking about how does digital
paper do things like respond to touch.

28
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,050
How do we show layers for instance,
inside of that digital paper landscape.

29
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:38,001
We made a number of prototypes across
the early stages of that project.

30
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:42,595
We even did some really ugly ones
with some really bad electronic

31
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:45,669
mesh-like touch responsiveness stuff.

32
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:46,880
>> Mm-hm.

33
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,840
>> That ultimately,

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,040
we did away with a lot of that stuff
in favor of a really simple UI and so

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,800
that's where we ended going with the
touch ripples, for instance, in Android.

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,970
I think a much better experience for
our users.

37
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,140
It's a little simpler, a little bit
cleaner and I think as a result a bit

38
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,919
more delightful than some of the early
mesh-tron like stuff we were doing.

39
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,300
>> Right, that makes sense.

40
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,061
And so some of these decisions you
made to sort of scrap this version

41
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:15,290
of a product and
come out with this simpler one.

42
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,830
Was that made based on user feedback?

43
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,580
Was that made based on some
other kind of feedback?

44
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,460
Was that made out of the blue?

45
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,370
>> Not really out of the blue.

46
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,700
We got tons and tons of feedback.

47
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,480
We as a group of designers and
developers were sequestered for

48
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,650
a couple of months
working on the project.

49
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,630
We got lots and lots of feedback from

50
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,270
not only the executive sponsors of
the project but then a number of design

51
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,070
stakeholders as well as a lot
of users that we did tests with.

52
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:45,670
We did some guerilla cafe-style
testing across the Google campus.

53
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,870
We even brought in
outside trusted testers

54
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,230
to give us their feedback
on the experience.

55
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,980
>> So you mentioned that
native prototyping has

56
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,360
sort of come to the forefront at Google.

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,140
>> That's right.
>> Can you talk a little bit about

58
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,040
why that is and sort of what you get out
of that that you wouldn't be able to get

59
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,820
out of just a web prototype
that you've put on on a phone.

60
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,990
>> Sure, one of the areas
that I think we have focused

61
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,220
a great deal of energy is actually
in prototyping voice experiences.

62
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,672
This is an area that we can't do a whole
lot as far as the web side of things.

63
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:19,966
For instance, we're limited by some
platform vendors in the access that we

64
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,250
have to their API's.

65
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:21,858
>> Mm-hm.
>> So

66
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:26,068
going with a fully native experience
means that we get a much wider set of

67
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:27,761
tools that we can work with.

68
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:28,717
So for instance,

69
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:32,682
in the we get much tighter
integration with voice components.

70
00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:35,363
>> Right.
>> We can do a really beautiful voice

71
00:03:35,363 --> 00:03:40,304
experience, lot's of delightful
animation around that experience as

72
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:44,400
we bring that prototype or
that application to life.

73
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,060
>> Perfect, thank you.
