00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,870
There's a link in the instructor notes
that'll take you to a website that

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,019
looks like this.

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,630
Take a look at these two images.

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,430
Both of them look the same,
but can you spot the problem?

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,890
Pop open dev tools and
see if you can find out.

6
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,570
What's different between them?

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,400
Is it their compression level,
their display size, their actual or

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,310
natural size, or their file type?

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,360
Check all that apply.
