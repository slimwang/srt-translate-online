00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,937
Let's do a few more questions like the last one. For each of these three

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:08,217
equations, please take the second line of boxes to fill in the operation that

3
00:00:08,229 --> 00:00:12,302
you do on either side of the equation, in order to isolate x in the last step.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,692
In each of these teal boxes, please fill in your final answer for what you think

5
00:00:16,704 --> 00:00:21,146
x should equal. Then when you're done, make sure that you take that number and

6
00:00:21,158 --> 00:00:25,365
substitute it back into the original equation to make sure that it actually is a

7
00:00:25,377 --> 00:00:25,846
solution.
