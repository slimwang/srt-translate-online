00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,880
It turns out that login is a special case of the general bind operation that I

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,910
described to you, and it is a special

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,620
case in the following sense. Password that the

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:19,560
user has for logging into the system at any point of time is used as the

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,850
handshake key to start with. And username is

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,581
used as a client ID. So, to initiate the

7
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:31,620
login session, the login process, the username given to the user

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:37,510
as the client ID, and the password as the HKC. But

9
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:44,980
other than that, it follows the same sequence of validating itself

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,660
to the server, and, similarly, validating the server to the client.

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,790
And at the end of that validation of both the client and the server, what the

12
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:00,000
server gives back to the login process, as I mentioned earlier, are a

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,850
pair of tokens. The secret token, and the clear token. And these two tokens

14
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,910
have to be sent securely on the wire, which is insecure. So

15
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:16,130
what the server will do is encrypt these two using

16
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,810
password as the handshake key. And therefore,

17
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,340
the login process can use the password to

18
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,620
decrypt the message that comes back from the

19
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,270
login server, and get these two tokens, secret

20
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:33,800
token and clear token. And these two tokens are kept by Venus for the rest of

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,000
this login session. And as we know, once

22
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,710
we've gotten these two tokens because clear token

23
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:47,110
is a data structure that contains the handshake key needed by Venus

24
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,120
for establishing RPC session, the rest of the life is made for us.
