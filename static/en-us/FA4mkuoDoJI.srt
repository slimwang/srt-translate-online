1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,240
The argmax function on the panda
series returns the index

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,750
where the maximum value occurred.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,550
In this case,
the index will be the country name.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,380
Then to find the value
corresponding to that country,

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,230
I'll use the loc attribute.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,020
And it'll auto return the country and
the value.
