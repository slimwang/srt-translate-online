1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,770
So that was a quick examination of the affect of one quality,

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,260
performance, on one architectural style.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,120
Let's look at the affect of another quality,

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,790
maintainability, on pipe and filters.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,180
On the positive side each of the filters in a pipeline is

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,459
an independent unit and this enhance, enhances encapsulation and reusability.

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,535
On the other hand some changes,

8
00:00:24,535 --> 00:00:28,280
like the format of the data that's going through the pipe line may affect,

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,683
all the, all of the filters, thereby increasing their coupling.
