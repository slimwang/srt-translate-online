1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is for Alice,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
testify is a dominant strategy.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's see. We have to compare it against all possible strategies for Bob.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If Bob does testify,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
then Alice gets -5 here and -10 here,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so testify is better.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And if Bob does refuse,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
then Alice gets 0 here and -1 here, so testify is better.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Testify is better for Alice no matter what,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and by similar reasoning,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
testify is better for Bob no matter what,

12
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so testify is a dominant strategy for both players.
