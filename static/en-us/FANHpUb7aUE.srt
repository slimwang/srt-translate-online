00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,050
Let us look at a connection between
your class projects and human cognition.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,780
Beginning with psychometrics,
psychometrics is the science of

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,030
measuring human intelligence,
aptitude, and knowledge.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,280
Computational psychometrics is
the science of building agents

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,188
that can take the same tests of
intelligence that humans take.

6
00:00:18,188 --> 00:00:22,690
All the [INAUDIBLE] building
AI agents that can address

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,200
the Ravens test of intelligence,
it will provide opportunities for

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,870
thinking about human cognition.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,520
While we will be looking only for

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,595
how well your agents perform on the
Ravens test, in principle [INAUDIBLE]

11
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:39,229
psycho-metrics will also look at
the kinds of errors that AI agents make.

12
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,200
If the errors the AI agents make
are similar to those that humans make,

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,690
then that may provide
a source of hypothesis

14
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,670
about human thinking on this
Raven's Test of Intelligence.

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,340
It is also interesting to note that
people with autism perform about as well

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,310
on the Raven's Test of Intelligence
as neurotypical people.

17
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,470
This is a little surprising, because
in general, people with autism do

18
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,180
not perform as well on other tests of
intelligence as the neurotypical people.

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,330
Note that Raven's test of
intelligence is the only test that

20
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,390
consists only of visual
analogy problems.

21
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,210
All other tests of
intelligence also include

22
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,460
a large number of verbal problems.

23
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,440
Might I suggest that some of
the thinking strategies that people with

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,960
autism are better aligned
with visual reasoning.
