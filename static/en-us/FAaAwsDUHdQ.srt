To find the compliment of 30 degrees, we took 90 degrees and subtracted that

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:09,334
angle. So, we got 60. We can use the same reasoning to find the compliment angle

3
00:00:09,346 --> 00:00:13,871
of this unknown angle. We know that angles add up to 90 degrees, so we start

4
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:18,609
with 90 degrees, then we subtract off angle x. We know we start with 90 degrees,

5
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:23,121
a right angle, and then we just subtract off angle x. This will leave us with

6
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:24,695
just the compliment angle.
