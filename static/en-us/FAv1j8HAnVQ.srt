So, to emphasize good programming style, here's a quiz. Why do we prefer version

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:09,830
A, where we used the named arguments, over version B, where we didn't? And these

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,850
two produce exactly the same thing. We can use format string with just using

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,782
squiggles with no names. It's just going to use the arguments passed in, in

5
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:20,032
order. The choices are, longer is better, and A is longer. If we make a mistake

6
00:00:20,032 --> 00:00:24,000
and use the wrong parameter name by using named parameters like we did in A, we

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,162
would get an error. For example, if we used value here instead of price, these

8
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:32,020
wouldn't match up and this would lead to a parameter error. With version B,

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,250
there's no names so there's nothing to match, so there wouldn't be any error.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,946
For the third choice, the names make it easier for others to read and understand

11
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:42,443
the code. Check all the good reasons why we would prefer A over B.
