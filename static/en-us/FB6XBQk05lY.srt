00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,060
Let's say in the distributed system, there are two events. I don't

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,610
know where they are happening. There's an event called a and there's

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,160
an event called b. Somewhere in the distributed system, these two events

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,620
are happening. And it so happens, when I look at the record

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,770
of all the time stamp associated with the events, I see that

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,410
the time stamp associated with a is less than the time stamp

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,086
associated with b. So I want to make sure that you understand

8
00:00:22,086 --> 00:00:25,270
the premise of the problem here. What I am saying is that the

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,110
time stamp that is associated with the event a happens

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,650
to be less than time stamp associated with the event

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,410
b. That's what I am observing, by looking at sort

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,010
of a log record of all the events that took

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:42,640
place in the system and now my question to you is. If C of a is less than C of

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,840
b, does that mean that a happened before b or

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,990
does it mean b happened before a or does it mean

16
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,460
a happened before b with the condition that it's either the case that

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,520
a and b are events in the same process or a is the

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,030
act of sending a message and b is the act of receiving the

19
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,050
corresponding message. So you have to pick

20
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,800
the right choice among these three choices.
