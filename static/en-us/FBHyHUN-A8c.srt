00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,750
Before we get into the code and
start correcting for

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,919
distortion, let's get some intuition
as to how this distortion occurs.

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:10,529
Here's a simple model of a camera
called the pinhole camera model.

4
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:12,219
When the camera forms an image,

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,310
it's looking at the world
similar to how our eyes do.

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,810
By focusing the light that's reflected
off of objects in the world.

7
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:22,679
In this case through a small pinhole,
the camera focuses the light that's

8
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,600
reflected off of a 3D traffic sign,
and forms a 2D image

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,750
at the back of the camera or
a sensor or some film would be placed.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,670
In fact the image it forms
here will be upside down, and

11
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,740
reversed because rays of light that
enter from the top of an object.

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,260
We'll continue on that angled
path through the pinhole and

13
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:44,099
end up at the bottom
of the formed image.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,829
Similarly, light that reflects
off the right side of an object

15
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:50,600
will travel to the left
of the formed image.

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,260
In math this transformation from 3D
object points, P of X, Y, and Z.

17
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:59,159
To 2D image points, P of just X, and

18
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,399
Y is done by a transformative
matrix called the camera matrix.

19
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,409
Which I'll call C for camera and

20
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:08,420
we'll need this to calibrate
the camera later on.

21
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,750
However, real cameras don't
use tiny pinholes like this,

22
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,849
they use lenses to focus
multiple light rays at a time.

23
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:17,309
Which allows them to
quickly form images.

24
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,210
But lenses can introduce distortion too.

25
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:22,669
Light rays often bend
a little too much or

26
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,290
too little at the edges of a curved lens
of a camera, and this creates the effect

27
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,690
we looked at earlier that
distorts the edges of images.

28
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,120
So that lines or objects appear, more or
less, curved than they actually are.

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,600
This is called radial distortion, and
it's the most common type of distortion.

30
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,049
Another type, is tangential distortion,
if the camera's lens is not aligned

31
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:47,500
perfectly parallel to the imaging
plane where the camera film or

32
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,629
sensor is,
this makes an image look tilted.

33
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:55,269
So that some objects appear farther
away or closer than they actually are.

34
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:57,459
And this is tangential distortion.

35
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:02,349
There are even example of lenses that
purposefully distort images like fisheye

36
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:07,149
or wide angle lenses which keep radio
distortion for stylistic effect.

37
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,800
But for
our purposes we are using this images

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,969
to position ourself driving car and
eventually steer it the right direction.

39
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:17,129
So we need undistorted images
that accurately reflect

40
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:19,129
our real world surroundings.

41
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:23,169
Luckily, this distortion can generally
be captured by five numbers called

42
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:27,399
distortion coefficients, whose values
reflect the amount of radial and

43
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,819
tangential distortion in an image.

44
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:33,019
In severely distorted cases,
sometimes even more than

45
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,130
five coefficients are required to
capture the amount of distortion.

46
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:38,560
If we know these coefficients,

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,849
we can use them to calibrate our
camera and undistort our images.

48
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:44,979
And the mathematical
details of correcting for

49
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:46,889
distortion are in the notes below.

50
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:49,829
Next we'll see how to get these
coefficients and calibrate a camera.
