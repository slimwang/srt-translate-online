1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,860
Now that we have a general
overview of the lighting tab,

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,120
let's dive deep into the scene tab.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,530
Starting from the top,
we have the environment lighting tab.

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,230
Remember the skybox from
the cameras lesson.

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,290
In that lesson we added a skybox
component to our camera, but

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,330
that resulted in us not
seeing it in the scene view.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,530
If we want to see our skybox in the
scene view and be the default sky for

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,450
our cameras.

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,740
You can actually set the skybox here.

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,630
Now let's set the skybox to
the one we created last lesson.

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,410
Drag and
drop it into the skybox property.

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,190
Now if we zoom out,

13
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,540
it most likely doesn't look like
the red tint that we set up.

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,820
That's because Unity's procedural skybox
is controlled by having a directional

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,780
light that emulates the sun.

16
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,860
We can set it in the environment
lighting tab with the sun property, and

17
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,510
if nothing is set there Unity
defaults to the strongest intensity

18
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,560
directional light within our scene.

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,260
Let's open up the directional
light we created and enable it.

20
00:00:57,615 --> 00:01:00,175
Now let's change it from
point to directional.

21
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,025
If your scene doesn't
look red like ours,

22
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:06,505
that's because we actually
need to rotate our light, so

23
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:10,780
that it's in a direction that's coming
from the top and facing our apartment.

24
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,750
Let's do that by rotating our sun
by 45 degrees in the x direction.

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,690
Awesome we now have our
skybox properly set up.

26
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,590
Now going back to lighting panel let's
look at the next property which is

27
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,400
ambient lighting.

28
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,690
Unlike any light we've discussed before,
ambient light is a light source that

29
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:33,750
affects all objects in the scene at
affix intensity and from all directions.

30
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,170
Basically think of it like
a 360 degree directional light.

31
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,000
We can send to be sampled from a skybox.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,230
Gradient, or just a simple color.

33
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,570
And for our purposes with the apartment,
we'll just want a simple color.

34
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,250
Once we set the color, we can then
change the ambient color property.

35
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,710
This allows us to change the color
as well as the current brightness.

36
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,960
To not overwhelm our area lights, let's
make sure we have a nice low gray set,

37
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,630
and then have the current
brightness at about point six.

38
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,980
The last core component of
environment lighting is reflexions.

39
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,230
In the real world light bounces
off a bunch of objects, but

40
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,710
calculating that in Real-Time
is an expensive process.

41
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,750
Unity has a system in place for
calculating reflections for

42
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,590
use with shiny objects.

43
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,140
And then the environment
tab allows us to specify

44
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,920
how reflections
are calculated from the sky.

45
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,520
Since our apartment is indoor, we don't
want it to be affected by the sky.

46
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,570
And that's want to turn off reflections.

47
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:35,560
To do that, simply make sure that the
reflections for us is set to custom and

48
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,840
the queue map is set to none.

49
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,310
If you do make a scene that
you want reflections for,

50
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,060
make sure to read the further
reading to learn more about them.

51
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,860
And that covers environment lighting.

52
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,580
I know a lot of this wasn't
part into our apartment but

53
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,080
still definitely useful to know in
case you are building scenes that

54
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,570
are affected by your environment.
