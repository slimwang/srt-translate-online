00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,510
So, what's all this listening
on a port business?

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,890
Well, it's like waiting for
a phone call.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,220
There's a particular phone
number that will reach you,

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,540
not just anyone at your address,
but you personally.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,720
That's how a port number distinguishes
different server programs running on

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,770
the same computer, like SSH on port 22,
or HTTP on port 80.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,500
Let's see what port's available for
me to listen on.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,150
Okay, here's port 3456,
I'm going to listen on that port now.

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,668
Just like NC-L3456.

10
00:00:30,668 --> 00:00:36,125
[NOISE]
Hello.

11
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,400
Yes this is net cat.

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,090
All of these other phones, are ports
that no server is listening on.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,582
If someone calls them, they're not
going to get an answer, instead,

14
00:00:46,582 --> 00:00:49,731
they'll get the equivalent of,
this number is disconnected,

15
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:52,901
which is an error message called
a reset packet or RST for short.
