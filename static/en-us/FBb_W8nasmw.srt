The solutions for this equation are x equals 3 plus or minus root 7 all divide

00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:10,243
by 2. Fantastic work if you found these solutions. I know they were tough. You

3
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:13,700
might have tried factoring here, but it turns out that we can't. For factoring,

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,496
we would have had to find factors of positive 2 that summed to negative 6. But

5
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:22,464
we know the only factor pairs are positive 2 and positive 1, and negative 2 and

6
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:27,120
negative 1. Now that are those pairs summed to negative 6, so we can't use

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,009
factoring. We also can't use the root method here. We don't have a perfect

8
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:35,294
square on one side of the equation. Completing the square would also not work,

9
00:00:35,294 --> 00:00:39,394
since our a value is positive 2. You would want the a value to be positive 1

10
00:00:39,394 --> 00:00:43,746
and the b value to be even in order to complete the square. So, using this

11
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:47,962
quadratic formula, we have a equal to 2, b equal to negative 6, and c equal to

12
00:00:47,962 --> 00:00:53,272
positive 1. We plug the values of a, b, and c into their positions to get this

13
00:00:53,272 --> 00:00:58,030
expression. The root of 36 minus 8 is the root of 28, and we know we can

14
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,290
simplify this root into 2 root 7. Next, we factor a 2 from the numerator,

15
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,258
leaving us with this expression. We cancel the common factor of 2, that appears

16
00:01:07,258 --> 00:01:09,926
in the numerator and in the denominator, which leaves us with our most

17
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:15,090
simplified form, our answers. We factor a 2 from these two terms to get this

18
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,324
expression. Then, we cancel the common factor of 2 and then the numerator and

19
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:22,010
the denominator to get our final answers.
