1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,830
Honeypots can be deployed in
a variety of locations on a network.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,420
A honeypot outside the external
firewall is useful for

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,890
tracking attempts to scan or
attack the internal network.

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,850
The main advantages of placing
the honeypot at this location are that.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,900
First of all,
it does not have any side effect.

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,000
Second, since it attracts and traps
attacks to the honey pot, it reduces

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,190
the amount of traffic, in particular
the attack traffic to the firewall.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,840
Therefore, it reduces
the amount of alerts

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,840
produced by the external firewall.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,705
On the other hand,

11
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:39,650
honeypot at this location does
not trap internal attackers.

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,730
A honeypot can also be placed in a DMZ

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,150
to trap attacks to
the public facing service.

14
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,110
On the other hand,

15
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:52,320
a honeypot at this location may not
be able to trap interesting attacks.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,450
This is because a DMZ is
typically not fully accessible.

17
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,150
That is, other than the well
defined public facing services,

18
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,160
no other services are supposed
to be available in DMZ.

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,140
That is, if an attacker is
attempting to access the honeypot.

20
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,650
And the service is not one
of these well-defined,

21
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,600
public facing services, the firewall
is going to block the traffic.

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,800
What if you say, let the firewall
allow the traffic to the honeypot.

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,160
But this would mean that we're
opening up the firewall.

24
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,080
And this is a security risk.

25
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,420
We can also place the honeypot
in the internal network

26
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,110
alongside with servers and workstations.

27
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,840
The main advantages here are that
it can catch internal attacks.

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,720
It can also detect
a misconfigured firewall

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,110
that forwards impermissible traffic from
the internet to the internal network.

30
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,150
On the other hand,

31
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,270
unless we can completely trap
the attacker within the honeypot.

32
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,770
The attack may be able to reach other
internal systems from the honeypot.

33
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,062
In addition,
in order to continue to attract and

34
00:01:56,062 --> 00:01:58,552
trap the attackers to the honeypot,

35
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:03,312
we must allow his attack traffic
from the internet to their honeypot.

36
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:07,793
This means that we must open up the
firewall to allow the attack traffic to

37
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:11,025
come from the Internet to
the internal network, and

38
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:13,240
this carries a huge security risk.
