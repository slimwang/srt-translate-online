00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,510
The class that defines a marker is
called the MarkerOptions class.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,680
With this you have a number of
properties that you use to define your

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,110
map marker.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,870
You can set its position using a LatLng,
and, of course, the LatLng

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,360
contains the latitude and longitude
where you want the marker to be.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,020
And you can set its
title using a string.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,280
As you saw earlier when I
had my rinks for example,

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,570
renton, all that was was
a string called renton.

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,078
And here is an example of building
a marker option that does that.

10
00:00:29,078 --> 00:00:35,200
I say MarkerOptions renton equals
new MarkerOptions.position,

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,450
my latitude and longitude, I just pass
it a new LatLng, with the latitude and

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,040
longitude, and then the title("renton").

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,368
So this was the code that I used to
generate that pin on renton that you saw

14
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:47,820
in the application.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,680
As you can see,
it's pretty straightforward.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,640
And when you have a map,

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,830
you can add this to your map by calling
the ad marker method on your map.

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,090
Let's take a look at this in
action in Android Studio.
