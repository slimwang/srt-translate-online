1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,425
Congratulations. You've completed this course.

2
00:00:02,425 --> 00:00:04,915
>> Thank you for taking the time and effort to do so.

3
00:00:04,915 --> 00:00:07,939
>> And we hope you've appreciated taking this class as much as we have creating

4
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:08,918
it.

5
00:00:08,918 --> 00:00:11,942
>> And we want to give a special thanks to everyone who made this possible, from

6
00:00:11,942 --> 00:00:15,014
our guest experts to our team here at Udacity, with a special thanks to Calvin

7
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:19,135
and Kugory who helped us produce this course.

8
00:00:19,135 --> 00:00:21,075
>> And now that we've come to a close in the course

9
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:24,671
>> We hope you can fully appreciate understanding psychology; that is human

10
00:00:24,671 --> 00:00:29,396
thought and behavior. Both scientifically and clinically and about sometimes

11
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:33,101
how these processes can go wrong, but if they do there are treatment options to

12
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:35,165
help people.

13
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:38,420
>> That's right. And we also hope you appreciate the complexity of our brains as

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,300
well as knowing that we need to have a healthy brain to function successfully

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,350
in our world. In addition, we hope that you appreciate the environment and how

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,600
that shapes our behavior, and how it's really a combination of both nature and

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,298
nurture that makes you, you.

18
00:00:52,298 --> 00:00:55,809
>> And because we're dedicated to making this the very best course we can make it.

19
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:58,455
We hope that you can give us feedback on this anonymous survey to tell us what

20
00:00:58,455 --> 00:01:02,972
you liked, what you loved, and what you thought needed improvement. And even

21
00:01:02,972 --> 00:01:05,239
though you're done, check back in from time to time, because we're going to add

22
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,366
new material.

23
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,331
>> And you can further your knowledge on Psychology.

24
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:10,344
>> 'Kay, cut. That's a wrap.

25
00:01:10,344 --> 00:01:11,885
>> It is a wrap.

26
00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:12,596
>> Yay.

27
00:01:12,596 --> 00:01:13,955
>> Woo. [clapping]
