[Peter] Since we want our Python code to print something,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
we're going to start with the print statement.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And the answer would be 7 x 7 x 24.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There are other ways to get at this, but I feel this is the most intuitive.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The 7 corresponds to the number of weeks.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The second 7 corresponds to the number of days we're calculating in each week,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and the 24 is the number of hours in each day.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So let's run this in the Python interpreter to see what the result is.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If we enter in the Python expression that we generated and click Run,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
we get 1176, which is the correct answer.
