1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,968
So while we looked at shutter speeds,

2
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:03,838
now let's talk about the concept of aperture.

3
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:06,611
Which basically, again, is nothing else, but

4
00:00:06,611 --> 00:00:10,240
the opening that lets in the light into the sensor.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,590
So as I said before, aperture is basically dependent on irradiance.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,310
Irradiance on a sensor is the amount of light captured and

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,540
is proportional to the area of the aperture opening.

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,350
So of course, the amount of light that's going to go through

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,930
the aperture is depending on how big the area is small area, larger area.

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,891
Traditionally of course when you just do

11
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:38,039
simple math you can see that the area really depends on pi, f over 2N.

12
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,983
Where f is the focal length, and

13
00:00:39,983 --> 00:00:43,710
N is the number that we'll talk about in a second.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,780
Here, f is the focal length of the lens being used.

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,960
And of course, you can start now looking at it as how does one

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,100
compute the area of something here.

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,290
And based on this,

18
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,870
can we actually now figure out what is the diameter of the aperture.

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,519
So of course, an area of a circle is pi r squared, where r would be the radius.

20
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,720
This is replacing the radius, by this term here.

21
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,338
Usually, in most cameras you'll actually see the aperture number.

22
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:14,478
Or even if you look at any of the details of the metadata of your image,

23
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:17,311
the aperture number would be actually written as a capital N.

24
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,400
And usually written as f over N.

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,010
Let's look at this in a little bit more detail.

26
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,980
So the focal length f and aperture number are known.

27
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,840
Now one of the interesting things to note is aperture number is

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,240
given irrespective.

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,530
It gives the irradiance of what's hitting the sensor irrespective of

30
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,180
the lens being used.

31
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,180
Because it's the f that's dependent on the lens.

32
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,870
And is of course size of the aperture.

33
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:55,140
So for example, when somebody gives you a lens f 2.0 on a 50 millimeters lens.

34
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,200
So f over 2 Aperture for a 50 millimeter lens.

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,620
Is going to basically say that the aperture size is 25 millimeters.

36
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,920
So for a f over 2 N number, for

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,000
a 200 millimeter lens, the aperture would be 100 millimeters.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,720
So this should start telling us that if the f number is low for

39
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,770
a telephoto lens.

40
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,310
That basically means it should be a much bigger, wider lens.

41
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,020
See here, I'm just showing you the lens that I had earlier shown you folks.

42
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,609
And this is, of course, a standard telephoto lens.

43
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:39,956
Has a lot of range and goes from 700, sorry 70, to 300 millimeter focal length.

44
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:45,638
It also has the f numbers written here from f 1 4, to 5.6.

45
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:51,750
And, basically, if I wanted the f number

46
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,100
to be low on this lens, I would have had to have, of course, a much bigger lens.

47
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,680
This one is of course limited by the size of this, and

48
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,480
of course, the size depends exactly on my aperture has to be smaller than this.

49
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,250
So if I really want a low aperture number.

50
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,790
I would need a thicker lens.

51
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,860
And you may have seen sports photographers carry those huge lenses out on

52
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,830
the sidelines to be able to capture images.
