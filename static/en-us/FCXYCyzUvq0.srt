1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,790
This third option is the way to go.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,590
To push the detail view controller the
table view controller proceeds in five

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,750
steps.

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,910
First it receives the invocation
from the table view that a row has

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,090
been selected.

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,780
It gets the detail view controller
from the story board object,

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,210
looks up the object associated with
the index path that was passed in,

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,130
sets the data in the detail
view controller, and finally,

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,790
pushes the detail view controller
on to the navigation stack.

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,940
Let's implement the master detail
pattern in the bond villain app.
