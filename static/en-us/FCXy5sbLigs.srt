1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So, let's build up to the answer in steps.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We know that if n=1, it just returns a single node.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If n=2, it's going to recursively generate

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
a single node for G1, a single node for G2,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
then randomly choose nodes from those sets,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
which in this case are just the only nodes that are there, so it'll choose them,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and then it connects them up.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So, that's what n=2 looks like.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
For n=4, we have two n=2, right?

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
G1 and G2 are both going to be an n=2 graph.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let me draw those.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Then, it's going to randomly choose one of the nodes and one of the nodes

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and connect them up.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So far, it looks kinda like a chain in all these cases.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's go to the next case.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Again, for n=8, it has to generate n=4 graphs,

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
each of which has to generate a bunch of n/2 graphs,

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
which all look like this.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There's going to be some randomness about how they get connected up.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So, maybe in one of the times we call it, we get something like this,

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and one of the times, we get something like this.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Then, we connect randomly the two n=4 graphs to get the n=8 graph,

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and maybe that will be something like this.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So, in this particularly case now, we don't have a chain anymore.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We do, on the other hand, have a tree.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And in fact, this property continues as we get bigger and bigger graphs.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We're always connecting up some kind of tree structure

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
with some other kind of tree structure. Here, I'll draw another one.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And we connect up these two tree structures,

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and that just gives us a bigger tree structure.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So, we get a nice, messy, recursively defined tree, but it's still a tree.
