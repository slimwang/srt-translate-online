1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,040
And one of the reasons why a bar chart like this is very good at

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,730
highlighting this missing data that's strict rigidity of the chart layout.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,170
Evenly spaced bars, with evenly spaces widths for each bar.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,990
The only variable we're working with in this case is the height of a bar.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,640
So if we had fairly regular and periodic data,

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,580
it becomes very apparent to a reader when a single periodic event doesn't occur.

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,840
But it would also say that this is one of the failings of

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,990
the bar chart for our data.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,780
One fundamental reason why the bar chart in our case doesn't work is that

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,310
the x axis is an intrinsically ordered variable.

11
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:44,740
Year 1932 comes before 1933, comes before 1934, and so forth.

12
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:49,010
A bar chart is typically best suited to represent categorical data where

13
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,440
these might be things like labels or groups, such as a state.

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,920
For example in our case might be the country or

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,380
continent in which the World Cup was held in.

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,100
And while years could be considered discreet values.

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,470
1932 can be thought of as a category in some sense.

18
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,120
There's a natural order to time, which makes a bar chart suboptimal.
