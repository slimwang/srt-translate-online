00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,748
For you first encounter with actual WebGL and 3js code, I'll give you a simple

2
00:00:04,748 --> 00:00:08,528
program that creates a scene with one object, a cube. And a few grids

3
00:00:08,528 --> 00:00:12,122
surrounding it. To see it, however, you'll have to get your hands dirty and fix

4
00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:15,816
a few syntax errors. In the code, to the left of the lines that have problems,

5
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:20,295
you'll see little marks that denote that you need to fix those lines. Make the

6
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:24,507
corrections, and then try doing the test run, and you should see this. Once you

7
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:27,822
fix the three syntax errors in the program, you should see something like this

8
00:00:27,822 --> 00:00:32,128
on your screen. Note that you can interact with it. You can move around, zoom

9
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:36,042
and pan. Try the various mouse controls to see how it works. If you get things

10
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:39,743
into a broken state, just refresh the page on your browser. Once you've got the

11
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:44,010
program running, try changing numbers in the code to see the effect. Don't worry

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,390
about what the code's doing at this point, I'll be covering that in the lessons

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,036
ahead. More importantly, I'll be explaining the underlying physical principles

14
00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:52,629
and mathematics behind this code.
