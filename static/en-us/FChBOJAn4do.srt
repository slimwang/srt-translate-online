00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,380
To set up your own create function
there's a couple of things

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,460
that you need to do.

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,360
First of all you're going to
to need member variables for

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,400
the various aspects of the UPI.

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,370
Use a TextView for
the status as you had in the layout and

6
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,300
you ought to have button controls for
request and remove.

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,340
So create these member variables and

8
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,980
then in uncreate use find
view by ID to set them up.

9
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,690
Then of course the next
thing you need to do is to

10
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,150
build the GoogleApiClient itself.

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,910
So go ahead and
implement this now in onCreate, and

12
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,130
check this box when you're done.
