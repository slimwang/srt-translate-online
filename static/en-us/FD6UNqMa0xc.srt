00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,160
So you're about to watch the Udacity
interview confessionals.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,110
This is a montage video of Udacity
employees talking about various

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,970
interview fails that they've
gone through in their careers.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,470
We show you these videos not because
we want to scare you off of interviews.

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,190
But to show you that while it might feel
very isolating to to go on an interview

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:27,100
on your own, we all go through the same
kind of mistakes and pains that you

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,700
probably are going through or
have gone through or will go through.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,470
And hopefully you'll remember these
videos and remember that each

9
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:40,820
opportunity that you have going into an
interview is an opportunity to practice.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,980
And an opportunity to move
forward in your career.

11
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:43,480
Good luck.
