1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,054
Another way of assessing personality is by sitting down with an individual one

2
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:09,226
on one and answering a series of questions. And these can be about how a person

3
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:13,345
behaves differently across different situations. They may ask what the person

4
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:18,390
was like when they were younger, or how they typically feel on any given day.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,926
Now, usually this is quite comfortable and relaxing for the participant because

6
00:00:21,926 --> 00:00:25,046
the questions are not limited to true or false, or agree or disagree type

7
00:00:25,046 --> 00:00:30,410
questions. However, we still have a problem with who is going to rate the

8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,658
answers? And whether or not those are reliable and valid. Now this technique is

9
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:39,554
very popular with psychotherapists. Who want to better understand their client

10
00:00:39,554 --> 00:00:44,036
and their client's personality. Therefore, they may ask questions such as have

11
00:00:44,036 --> 00:00:47,222
you always been anxious or in what situations do you find yourself most

12
00:00:47,222 --> 00:00:51,872
anxious. But now let's go to Lauren and we're going to discuss projective

13
00:00:51,872 --> 00:00:52,670
tests.
