1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,138
This is R studio, it's an ID or an Integrated

2
00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:07,043
Development Environment and it's what we'll be using to create

3
00:00:07,043 --> 00:00:09,810
R scripts and to create plots. It's a point and

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,580
click system that organizes our workspace and it has some

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,530
nice features for creating and sharing work. Here's a basic

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,920
tour of it. The main interface contains four panels that

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,150
can be resized as needed. Now, you may only see

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,580
three panels when you open R studio. If so, just open

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,610
a new R script by clicking on the file, and then

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,060
New File > Rscript. So, in the top left here, we

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,070
have Rscripts. These are the files in which we will type

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,430
our R commands. We'll also save these files, so we can alter

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,130
them or share them at a later time. In the bottom

14
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,520
left, we have the R Console. You can type in R

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,810
commands here. However, these R commands will only be saved in

16
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,870
a temporary history. The commands won't be saved to a file like

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,240
up in here that can be reviewed at a later

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,630
date. In the top right of R studio, we have two

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:01,690
tabs. One called Environment and one called History. The Environment will

20
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,620
contain all the objects, functions and values that are in the

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,580
current working memory for R. History on the other hand

22
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,870
will keep a running log of any of the R commands

23
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,880
that we run. Now we can run R scripts directly from

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,980
our files but we can also type them into the console.

25
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,600
No matter which way we type them in the History will

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,570
capture them. And finally, in the lower right, we have the

27
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,890
Files, Plots, Packages, Help and Viewer section. You'll learn more about

28
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,800
these later but this is where our plots or graphs will

29
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,710
first appear when we run an R command that creates a

30
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,140
visualization. Now that we've gone over the layout of R Studio,

31
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,450
I want you to match some actions that you might do

32
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,134
in each panel of R. Remember this first panel is for

33
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:44,155
R files or Rscripts. This second area is for the

34
00:01:44,155 --> 00:01:47,760
workspace or the history. This third space is the Console where

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,690
we get our output. And this fourth panel is for Files,

36
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,460
Packages, Plots, and Help. So for example, if I asked you

37
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,680
to match the activity to one of these panels, like

38
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,380
save an R script that would correspond to box number one.

39
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,690
You can save them by clicking on this button. Now we

40
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,530
could of course use the main menu, but I'm actually include

41
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,740
as any one of your options here. The main purpose of this quiz is

42
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,140
just to get you familiar with R studio. So here are your list of actions.

43
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,740
And I want you to pair it with the panel where you would do it

44
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,320
in R studio. Put the number of the corresponding panel in each of the boxes.
