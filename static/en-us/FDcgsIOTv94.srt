00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,952
Let's write the null and alternative hypothesis in statistical symbols. For the

2
00:00:03,952 --> 00:00:08,558
null, we use a capital H with a subscript 0 to indicate the null hypothesis. We

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:13,298
put a colon to show that what comes after is the null hypothesis. We use mu

4
00:00:13,298 --> 00:00:17,394
subscript program to indicate what the average amount spent per week on food

5
00:00:17,394 --> 00:00:23,540
would be if we could implement this whole program throughout the entire co-op.

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,635
What we're saying here is that if we implemented this new program, the average

7
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:31,478
amount of money spent per week on food by the co-op members would be either

8
00:00:31,478 --> 00:00:38,078
equal to 151, the original population mean, or greater. In other words, there

9
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:42,448
will be no improvement. Now, let's write the alternative. We have some H, the

10
00:00:42,448 --> 00:00:46,593
subscript A for alternative hypothesis. I'll write alt over here to remind us

11
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:51,850
that that's what it is. We have a colon in the right place. We input the value

12
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,086
of the population parameter. If we could go to all co-op members and give them

13
00:00:56,086 --> 00:01:00,720
this mu program, what would their average cost be per week? And we hope there

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,018
will be a reduction, so we'll write less than 151. Be sure to write these down

15
00:01:05,018 --> 00:01:06,299
on your sheet of paper.
