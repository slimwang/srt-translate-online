1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,083
For the first inequality, we can just subtract 1 from both sides, and we get x

2
00:00:04,094 --> 00:00:08,250
is less than or equal to 8. The second inequality is a little harder. First we

3
00:00:08,262 --> 00:00:12,240
add 2 to both sides, then we divide by a negative 1. Remember, when I divide

4
00:00:12,252 --> 00:00:16,347
here, I need to reverse my inequality sign. So I get x is greater than or equal

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,360
to 5. For compound inequalities though, this doesn't necessarily mean the

6
00:00:21,372 --> 00:00:26,120
answer. We want to figure out which numbers satisfy this condition, and this

7
00:00:26,132 --> 00:00:29,335
condition. Let's see if we can figure that out next.
