1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] And the solution is let's look at different sequences

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
in which head occurs at least 3 times.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It could be head, head, head, head, in which it comes 4 times.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It could be head, head, head, tail and so on, all the way to tail, head, head, head.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of those outcomes.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Each of them has a 16th for probability, so it's 5 times a 16th, which is 0.3125.
