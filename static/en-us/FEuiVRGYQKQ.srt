1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,019
The best place to start learning Cast
is our collection of sample apps.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,370
We have everything from a hello Cast
example to a complete video player.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,380
Hello Cast is a great learning tool.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,570
It includes a one-file sender app,
it's easy to understand.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,240
And once installed, it lets you do this.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:17,490
Hello world.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,750
Next step is our reference application,
Cast videos.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,540
This complies with the design checklist,
and

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,480
it's by far your best bet to use as
a starting point for your integration.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,680
Source code is available for
Android, iOS, and Chrome.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,900
It includes a reference
receiver app as well, and

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,550
we also have samples to help you
with specific tasks like DRM.

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,240
Now before we get into
the details there's a couple

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,190
of topics we should discuss first.

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,510
A receiver app is launched when a sender
tells a cast device, like a Chrome Cast,

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,920
that it wants to launch
a particular receiver.

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,240
It does this by specifying
an application ID.

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,640
All receiver apps have
a unique application ID,

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,450
and the sender must provide this
during its request to the cast device.

20
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,490
The cast device then looks up that
application ID using Google service, and

21
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,510
then downloads the URL that
corresponds to the receiver app.

22
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,870
It then loads it onto the cast device.

23
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,360
When you start adding cast
functionality into your application,

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,900
the first thing you'll need to
do is get an application ID, and

25
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,910
you'll do this by visiting
the Cast Developer Console.

26
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,990
This is a self service online console
where you can publish your own receiver

27
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,040
apps so they can be downloaded
by any cast device.

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,830
This is actually pretty important and
great for developers,

29
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,700
because it means you can self-manage
your Google Cast receiver releases.

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,250
To do so, you'll first need to
register as a Cast developer, and

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,960
pay a small $5 registration
fee to verify your account.

32
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,860
This is just a one-time thing.

33
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,380
Once you've registered, you'll be
greeted by the developer console where

34
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,340
you can register your
receiver applications,

35
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,820
as well as register your Cast devices.

36
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,840
It's important to register
your cast devices, so

37
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,260
they can be used for debugging.

38
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,260
And the main reason is so they can
download a non-published receiver app.

39
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,230
Once you've registered your cast device,
it can take about 15 minutes for

40
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,400
those changes to propagate out,

41
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,450
and you'll need to reboot your
cast device at that time.

42
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,620
I'd recommend going ahead and
registering your cast device for

43
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,640
development now.

44
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,460
This is important to do, because cast
functionality is unfortunately not

45
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,820
supported by the emulators.

46
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,345
So we need to use a real Android
device like a phone or a tablet.

47
00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:09,139
.And a real cast device like a
Chromecast for development anti-bugging.

48
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:13,350
These are some of the recently published
receiver apps at chromecast.com/apps.

49
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,980
When you publish your receiver,
it can take about six hours for

50
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,430
those changes to propagate
to all cast devices.

51
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,010
And, although the user experience
guidelines we mentioned earlier

52
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,980
are optional, they are required if you'd
like to be featured on this web site.

53
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,070
Developing is optional for
this class, and if you'd like,

54
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,380
you can follow along without
doing any on your own.

55
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,610
But if you do intend to
write cast applications,

56
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,130
then I'd recommend going ahead now and

57
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,000
creating an account at Cast Developer
Console and registering your device.
