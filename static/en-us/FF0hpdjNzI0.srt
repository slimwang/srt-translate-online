00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,735
We've looked extensively at how
AsyncTask can be used to move

2
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:06,770
time-consuming operations
to a background thread, and

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,460
how to get the result back
onto the main thread.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,520
So you must be antsy now.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,830
So now I'd like you to fix
the NetworkOnMainThreadException

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,040
that caused the Did You Feel It
app to crash on start up.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,340
So go ahead and move the networking code
off the main thread using AsyncTask, and

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,670
check this box here when you're done.

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:29,990
Now, we recommend keeping the utility
methods in the utils class and

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:35,210
we use it to house some useful helper
methods shown here in the structure tab.

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,960
Also note that these methods
are declared as static, so

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,080
that they can be referenced directly
using the class name without needing

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,660
an actual instance of the utils object.

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,780
In the main activity, we can call
the utils.fetchEarthquakeData method

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,120
to make the network request and
parse the response.

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,750
When you're done, the app should look
like this screenshot here on the right.
