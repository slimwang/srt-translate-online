1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,890
The correct answer is B and C.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,373
There's definitely an increasing
interest in consumers assuming more

3
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,741
active roles in their care,

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,318
as we've discussed a number
of times in this course.

5
00:00:10,318 --> 00:00:14,639
And we're all familiar with
the rapid growth of smartphones,

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,285
sensors, and other far less expensive,
and relatively mobile and

7
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:22,250
hopefully more user-friendly devices.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,250
So given all of that,
A is clearly wrong, if anything,

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,830
patients are more capable of sending
data to their physicians today

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,820
than they were in the past.
