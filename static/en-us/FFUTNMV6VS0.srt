1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,790
All right, for this exercise we
want to do the same thing, but for

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,180
the latitude and longitude search.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,520
One caveat to the search,

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,200
is that we need to convert
the values from the latitude and

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,213
longitude text fields, into the bbox
parameter that Flickr expects.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,920
Remember from our demonstration
using the Eiffel Tower's coordinates

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,530
that the bounding box string
needs to be a list of

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,370
four values in the order from minimum
longitude to minimum latitude,

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,470
maximum longitude and
then finally maximum latitude.

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,480
So I'm going to help you get started.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,830
First, I'm going to copy over the
parameters from the text search while

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,889
making sure to remove
the text parameter.

13
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:43,386
Then, we'll add a B box parameter and
I'm going to recommend that we populate

14
00:00:43,386 --> 00:00:45,998
this value using a method
called bboxString.

15
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:52,330
So that method doesn't exist yet,
so we should be getting an error.

16
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,166
And then, we can just put this anywhere.

17
00:00:54,166 --> 00:01:01,405
We'll say private func
bboxString ( ) --> String.

18
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:06,705
Now it's going to be your job
to implement this method.

19
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:11,115
Before you get started, I want to
point our four useful constants in

20
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:13,145
the constants.swiftall
that can help you.

21
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:18,677
The first two are called
SearchBBoxHalfWidth and

22
00:01:18,677 --> 00:01:20,447
SearchBBoxHalfHeight.

23
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:24,587
What these constants represent
is the amount that you want to

24
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:28,787
vary the latitude up and down and
the longitude left to right.

25
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,930
Now feel free to adjust these constants
if you want to vary the overall size of

26
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,350
your bounding box, but
the one default value should be fine.

27
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,430
The other two constants
are the SearchLatRange and

28
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,240
SearchLonRange tuples,
notice these are tuples.

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,274
And you should try to use these two
constants to ensure the bounding box you

30
00:01:49,274 --> 00:01:51,096
create, does not use latitude or

31
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:54,366
longitude values that fall
outside of the accepted range.

32
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:59,673
For example, if a user enters
the latitude of negative 89.5,

33
00:01:59,673 --> 00:02:04,598
and then you use this half,
I guess that would be half Height,

34
00:02:04,598 --> 00:02:07,153
to vary it by one up and one down,

35
00:02:07,153 --> 00:02:12,108
it would result in negative 90.5 and
negative 88.5.

36
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:14,930
Now the negative 88.5 value is fine.

37
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,780
It falls within this range.

38
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,740
However, the negative 90.5 value falls

39
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,510
outside of the accepted range because
it is lower than negative 90.

40
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,860
So you can use these constants and
perhaps combine them with Swift's max or

41
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,910
min functions to ensure that this
kind of error doesn't happen.

42
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,870
If you never used Swift's max or
min functions before, I've posted a link

43
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,730
to a stack overflow post that describes
them in the instructor notes.

44
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,990
Now I'll leave the implementation
of the bbox method up to you.

45
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,800
If you correctly implement the method
you should see a URL like this one

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,110
assuming the half width and

47
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,945
half height constants are set to their
default values of one, and the user does

48
00:02:55,945 --> 00:03:01,635
a Lat/Lon search with a latitude
of 48.85 and a longitude of 2.29.

49
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:04,265
Check this box when you're done.

50
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:04,765
Good luck.
