1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:04,270
So if we talk about quantifications,
is there a formula for risk or

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,520
the risk exposure we have?

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,450
Risk is really, we said, how likely,

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,730
the probability of an adverse
security event happening.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,230
So the first thing you have to say,

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,520
well there is a threat out there,
they may come after me.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,020
I have some controls in place, but
they may be able to get around them.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,890
And actually, I might get compromised,
may experience a breach or

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,440
whatever it is.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,100
So what is the likelihood of that?

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,254
So you have to have the probability,

12
00:00:30,254 --> 00:00:33,876
then you have to multiple by
the impact of that adverse event.

13
00:00:33,876 --> 00:00:37,400
It's going to cost me $10
million to deal with that.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,540
Well, the probability is half.

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,260
That's way too much.

16
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,510
But if it is half and

17
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,910
it's going to cost you $10 million,
your risk is $5 million.

18
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,584
We said quantifying, of course we had
to quantify both of these quantities.

19
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:54,595
The probability, as well as the impact
or the loss that you're going to suffer

20
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:58,300
as a result of the adverse
event that we're talking about.

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,887
So there's something
called risk leverage,

22
00:01:00,887 --> 00:01:03,418
because we like to reduce
our risk exposure.

23
00:01:03,418 --> 00:01:07,950
And one way we can do that is by having
some sort of a control in place.

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,020
A control we know comes with a cost.

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,760
So risk leverage is for a given control.

26
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,030
Talking about quantifying it and
then sort of, if it's too high,

27
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,710
you don't like it, we can try to reduce
it by putting in one or more controls.

28
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,834
So when you put a control you can ask
what the risk level of that control is.

29
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:30,116
So, the way to sort of compute that
is that you say, what was my risk

30
00:01:30,116 --> 00:01:34,900
exposure before or without the control
that is under consideration?

31
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,542
That's without deploying that.

32
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:41,120
Minus the risk exposure after
this control is deployed.

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,660
This difference really is nothing but
the amount by which the risk is reduced

34
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,380
because of this control that we're
going to put into our enterprise.

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,980
So, that's the decrees in risk
divided by the cost of that control

36
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,040
that we're talking about.

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,150
We've been saying,
we have to have cost benefit analysis.

38
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,610
This is how much risk.

39
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,170
This is what happens to risk
if we do something about

40
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,490
unacceptable level of risk.

41
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,479
So this is the cost of that control,
that we have in the denominator here.

42
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,410
So, if you divide the reduction
in risk by the cost,

43
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,230
that gives you the risk leverage.

44
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,460
For any control that you have,
risk leverage should be greater than 1.

45
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,460
It makes no sense for it to be less than
1 because, in that case you're saying,

46
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,020
your risk reduction actually
is smaller than the cost.

47
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,580
It's not very smart that
you pay more and, overall,

48
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,330
you're not in a better place than you
were before in terms of the cost and

49
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,700
whatever risk that you have.

50
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,160
So, this is how we compute the leverage,
and whenever you talk about

51
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,580
a particular control, if you do this and
the value is not greater than 1,

52
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,250
then of course that control
should not be considered.
