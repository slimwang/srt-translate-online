00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,133
Here's a zoom in of the origional geometry, and here's a view after my

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:08,880
modifications. I changed the legs and feet of the model to have rounded edges.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,520
So, instead of a block with perfectly sharp edges, there's a small bevel. This

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,244
detail looks a bit more realistic, since most plastic parts are not razor sharp.

5
00:00:18,244 --> 00:00:21,418
More importantly, a bevel lets the model pick up specular highlights along its

6
00:00:21,418 --> 00:00:26,534
edge. Here's sharp edges again. Here's smooth. It's worth keeping in mind that

7
00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:30,080
specular highlights don't add all that much to flat surfaces. Which is why I use

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,903
the teapot for most material demos in this unit.
