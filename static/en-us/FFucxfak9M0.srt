1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,950
Settings activity is tied
to a list of preferences.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,270
And the location edit text preference is
a custom preference that we have added

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,680
a widget to.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,400
That widget, when clicked,
should build an intent and

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,830
start the place picker activity.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,170
And when that activity returns,
it should have a place for

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,910
us, which means that we need to process
the result of the place picker called in

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,040
on activity result inside
of settings activity.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,220
And if we have a new place we need
to store that in our location

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:27,960
shared preference.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,250
Of course, before we can do this we have
to configure our app for the places API.

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,240
We need to add another
dependency to our build.gradle.

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,950
Recall how Google Play Services allows
you to specify the bundles that you care

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,850
about and ignore the others.

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,620
We already have the GCM bundle but
now we need to add the location one.

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,860
Then, to use the place picker, we need
to add a permission to our Android

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,920
manifest that will give us access to
location at a fine-grained detail.

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,340
Now let's look at our
place picker backwards.

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,590
What will we do once we have
the place picker response?

20
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,762
In on Activity Result and
Settings Activity, we need to parse and

21
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:06,070
store the address as our
new location for Sunshine.

22
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,800
First, we should verify that this
activity result is actually intended

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,770
for us.

24
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,780
And if it isn't, the place picker
response will pass it along to super

25
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,580
in order for them to handle.

26
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,740
If it is from the place picker and
a location was chosen,

27
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,600
then we can fetch the place
object from the place picker API.

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,390
Then look at the address to use as
a human readable location string and

29
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,990
store this in our shared preference for
location.

30
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,610
However, if the result
code is not successful,

31
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,490
we're going to gracefully fail
by not doing anything at all.

32
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,690
The most likely cause for

33
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,110
this is the user hitting back without
choosing a place at which point,

34
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,430
returning to an unchange setting
screen is the correct thing to do.

35
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,740
To launch the place picker
we need to build an intent.

36
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,333
But we are in a view not an activity,

37
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:53,970
which means we won't be able to
call start activity for a result.

38
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,980
So, we need to cast the context
to a specified activity.

39
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,490
In this case,
that would be settings activity.

40
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,150
This will allow us to make the call to
start the place picker, and by choosing

41
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,620
settings activity, the result of the
place picker ends up in the right place.

42
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,480
I'm going to let you figure out how to
build the intent and launch it however.
