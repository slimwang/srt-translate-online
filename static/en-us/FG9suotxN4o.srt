1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,310
I'll start at the top.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,490
And no, complicated password
requirements are not likely to drive

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:11,160
users away unless there's something
totally insane like 1,000 characters.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,190
But in that case, you should still
just use a password manager and

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,870
then not worry about it, so no.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,100
Registration gates will though.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,980
More on this one in a moment.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,660
Suggesting products is fine,

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,340
no harm in subtlety helping people
find products that they might like.

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,040
Just don't overdo it.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,898
And a shipping address should have a
name, so this one also isn't a problem.

12
00:00:32,898 --> 00:00:33,497
Okay, so

13
00:00:33,497 --> 00:00:37,580
it looks like the only problem from this
list is registration gates on checkout.

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,790
Remember how you should avoid

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,680
putting your products
behind a registration wall?

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,730
The same applies to purchases.

17
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,470
When someone wants to buy something,
they just want to buy it.

18
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,670
Don't slow them down, and
that's all registration gates really do.

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,630
If you minimize the time to conversion,
you'll watch your conversions increase.
