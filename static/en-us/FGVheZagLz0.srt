00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,920
And now I want to look at a couple of examples of approaches taken to these kind

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,860
of applications. You can think of these a computing paradigms or, methods for

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,620
dealing with particular kinds of situations.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,900
In particular they both relate to services. One of them is web services and

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,420
the other is service oriented architecture.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:25,250
For the purposes here we can say that a service is a self contained, self

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,700
defined unit of computation that's meaningful to the user. We'll go into that

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,010
a little bit more when we look as these two particular, types of implications.
