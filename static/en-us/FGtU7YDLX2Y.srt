1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:07,465
So 3.14, is greater than this z critical value for an alpha level of 0.001. So,

2
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:14,908
a z score of 3.14 occurs out here somewhere in the green region. So this is

3
00:00:14,908 --> 00:00:24,660
significant at probability less than 0.001. And 2.07 is between 1.65 and 2.32.

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,220
So that z score, occurs somewhere in this red region. So it's significant at p

5
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:36,626
less than .05. Hopefully this is making sense. Let's do that last two. 2.57

6
00:00:36,626 --> 00:00:43,178
will occur somewhere in this blue region, because that z score is in between

7
00:00:43,178 --> 00:00:51,785
2.32 and 3.08. So the probability of getting this z score is 0.01. And finally,

8
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:56,360
this is a really huge z score so, this sample mean occurs somewhere way out

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:02,638
here, far from the mean. But we don't conventionally have an alpha level that

10
00:01:02,638 --> 00:01:07,174
is that small, so we'll just say that the probability of getting that sample

11
00:01:07,174 --> 00:01:13,718
mean, is less than 0.001, good job. So just to recap, if our sample mean falls

12
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:18,140
in the critical region, for an alpha level of 0.05, It's unlikely and therefore

13
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:24,300
probably didn't occur by chance. Something's going on, and there are different

14
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,323
levels that help us decide how sure we are.
