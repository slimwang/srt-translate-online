1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,140
Now, let's take a look at our mocks and
think about which

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,040
places we expect users to be able
to interact with on each screen.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,270
This is vital to the next step, where
we actually build out our prototype.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,810
So, for each of the mocks you see here,

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,810
how many attraction points are there for
that mock.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:17,430
In this case,

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,490
we're interested in interaction points
that bring the user to a new screen.
