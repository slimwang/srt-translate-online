1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,042
So, we eventually got to find the x-intercepts of this equation that we didn't

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:08,122
know how to factor, but this is a pretty long winded process. Unfortunately,

3
00:00:08,122 --> 00:00:12,288
this is a situation that we actually run into quite a bit. It's really only very

4
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:16,529
special cases of quadratic equations that we can factor. Thankfully, there's a

5
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,435
formula that we can use to calculate the roots of a quadratic equation so we

6
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:24,852
don't have to go through this long process every single time. Now, get excited,

7
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:29,175
because you are going to work out that formula yourself. We're going to start

8
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:33,595
with the general form of a quadratic equation, ax squared plus bx plus c equals

9
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:37,609
0. And we're going to use this to solve for x. This might look a little bit

10
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:41,326
complicated at certain points but once you've gotten to the end and you

11
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:45,295
understand why the formula we end up with works, you'll get to use this every

12
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:49,517
single time. Let's follow this same method as we did in the last example. First

13
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:53,378
things first, let's complete the square. It might be a little bit messy but

14
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:57,267
we're going in. The first thing I'd like you to do is to factor out a from these

15
00:00:57,267 --> 00:01:00,704
first two terms here. What belongs inside these parenthesis then?
