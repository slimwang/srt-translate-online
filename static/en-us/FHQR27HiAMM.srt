00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,810
At the end of the previous video we chose a metric which we thought would be

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,000
a good way to quantify the question when will my service deck arrive?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,890
We ended up going with the technician's actual reported arrival time at

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,190
the customer's home.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,930
Now to proceed we have to find a way to turn that

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:22,300
question into a rigorous statistical inference problem such as point estimation,

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,130
confidence sets, classification or parameter estimation.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,490
For example, the problem could be cast as a classification problem in which we

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,840
attempt to predict if the technician will arrive before noon or after noon.

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,210
At the complete other end of the spectrum,

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:42,230
we could create a regression estimator which predicts a precise time of arrival.

12
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,360
Both of these have advantages and disadvantages.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,030
Now before telling you how we approach this problem.

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,300
We would love to know if you cast this as a classification or

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,540
a regression problem.

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,240
Why or why not?

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,230
Like the previous assessment, please share your thoughts with your

18
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,230
