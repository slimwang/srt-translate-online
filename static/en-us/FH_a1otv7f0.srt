1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now, we suspect the drug doesn't work as well as advertised, here is the hard question.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Where does the credibility region end?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Put differently, what is the largest number of healthy people

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
in the critical region or that define the critical region?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's the largest number of healthy people out of the 10 where you'd be suspicious

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and you wouldn't be 95% confident using our 95/5% confidence threshold.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You'd really reject the claim made by the manufacturer of this drug.
