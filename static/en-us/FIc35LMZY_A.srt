1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,840
So first let's talk about what a dynamic
range is in the real world and

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,230
what kind of images we're talking about.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,833
Let's use that to situate our problem.

4
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:12,905
I'm going to show you a bunch of
pictures that I took all around my house

5
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:13,625
a while ago.

6
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:17,471
And again, it was a sunny day so I was
able to capture images under the sun,

7
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:20,712
but at the same time I was able
to find different dark corners.

8
00:00:20,712 --> 00:00:24,388
And the goal here is to showcase to
you a variety of pictures taken under

9
00:00:24,388 --> 00:00:26,208
different lighting conditions.

10
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:30,250
So for example this is my first image
where I took basically in a dark corner.

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,266
I took it inside,
there are no lights, you know,

12
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:36,167
kind of,
illuminating any part of that scene.

13
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:39,786
And even with the long exposure you can
see basically it's a dark image with

14
00:00:39,786 --> 00:00:41,560
nothing there.

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,230
Second image I took was
basically again inside, but

16
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,470
with regular inside incandescent bulbs.

17
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,760
You can see a little bit of the scene,
it's a little bit kind of darkish

18
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,530
orangish, reddish kind of
stuff are visible, but

19
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,990
you can see that there's
not much detail here.

20
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,780
Moving up, then we go, still remain
inside, but this time I'm actually near

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,950
a window, which basically means that
the scene is now naturally lit.

22
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,810
So there's a little bit
of detail in the scene.

23
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,970
Now you can actually see the character
and the book and everything.

24
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,580
Next one I basically now move
the same two objects outside, but

25
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,980
this time I'm under a shade.

26
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,280
Again you can notice that from going
here the amount of light is increasing.

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,120
Finally move to the outside,
now this time under the sun of course,

28
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,560
I've intentionally made it still
that there are no shadows or

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,890
anything else like that.

30
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,610
But you can see now the scene is much,
much better lit.

31
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,490
Of course in none of these images
I'm playing around with any

32
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,630
external lighting source like flash or
anything else like that.

33
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,520
Another whole instance would be as
I can now just take the camera and

34
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,000
point it straight into the sun.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,287
Of course the complete opposite
of this dark image here,

36
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:52,625
everything is just completely bright.

37
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,442
So you notice now that, you know,

38
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:57,767
there are lots of different types
of lighting conditions, and

39
00:01:57,767 --> 00:02:01,292
the light actually plays a role in
what kinds of images we capture.

40
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:04,488
And we've discussed this when
we talked about illumination.

41
00:02:04,488 --> 00:02:07,620
But now let's try to understand and
quantify some of this, so we

42
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,520
can understand, what are the different
ranges of light intensity that's

43
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,420
actually in the natural environment
that we're trying to capture?
