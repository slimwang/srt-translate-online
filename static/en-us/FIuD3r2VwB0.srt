1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,890
So the objectives of this lesson are for

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,410
you to learn about
what is Dynamic Range.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,040
We will specifically talk about Dynamic
Range as a concept that applies to

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,680
images, and how we want to be able to
capture real scenes with the lighting

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,120
and radiometric information of the scene
to capture the best possible image.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,550
We'll also think about what makes or

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,010
prevents a camera to be able to
capture dynamic range correctly.

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,100
Specifically talking about
digital cameras, and

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,930
how they encode information?

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,010
Or do not encode the information
of dynamic range of an image.

11
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,450
We will talk about
the Image Acquisition Pipeline.

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:40,270
Which is aimed at capturing the scene
brightness, the scene radiance, and

13
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,500
basically covert them to pixel values.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,130
And of course,
those are the pixel values.

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,730
We can do various types of mathematics
on to generate newer types of images.

16
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,200
We will look at the variety
of a linear and

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,790
non-linear aspects that are inherent
in an image acquisition pipeline.

18
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,500
That will allow us to
start thinking what,

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,780
what kind of mapping we want
to model and build upon.

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,790
In this lesson, we will also cover
aspects of camera calibration.

21
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,150
That will allow us to
calibrate a camera, so

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:12,260
we can actually be able to get
the right kinds of levels of images and

23
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,970
colors, that are actually visible
in the scene, into a real image.

24
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,030
So the goal here is to
calibrate a camera,

25
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,740
so we will be able to look at
the exact colors in a scene, and

26
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,900
be able to capture all of those
to replicate them in an image.

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,180
We will then discuss
how we can take values,

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,480
the pixel values of intensities from
different exposures of an image.

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,070
Again, this is where a camera comes in,
how we'll use the exposure?

30
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,090
You know,
to remember things like aperture and

31
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,600
shutter, to then actually capture
the light information, and

32
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,510
then use that to generate
a new image of the scene.

33
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,180
And then we'll talk about Tone Mapping.

34
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,520
Which is aimed at taking a high dynamic
range image and then converting it in

35
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,910
a form that would be made visible
on the traditional display or

36
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,790
perhaps even bring it out so

37
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,180
you can actually see all the different
types of dynamic range in that image.
