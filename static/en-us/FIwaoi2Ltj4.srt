1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,000
The obvious approach to selecting components is to say, well what is it

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,070
the system is supposed do or compute and break that down into, into pieces.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,420
However there are many other factors that might go into deciding

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,460
which components are going to be part of your system.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,590
Of course, required functionality is, is most important there, but

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,600
it may also be the case that you already have some existing reusable components

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,320
from your libraries that you want to build into your system.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,420
And that may have a important role in deciding on

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,710
the overall component structure as would the physical machine architecture,

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,490
that is the architecture providing you multiple cores in which case how can you

11
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,780
take advantage of those in, in breaking down your computation.

12
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,830
Another element you might not have thought of is your staff,

13
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,040
that is the people who are going to do this.

14
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,370
Conway's Law say's that the ultimate structure of

15
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,500
a system depends upon the structure of the organization building it.

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,280
So it's well to take into account that if you have three people helping you

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,700
lay out the architecture you're likely to end up with three major components.

18
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,750
Another important element is that for

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,160
real systems they're going to have long lifetimes.

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,600
And the trajectory of that lifetime,

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,500
the direction in which it's going to move as we saw in the Brohoff definition,

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,960
could and should strongly influence the components into which you divided.
