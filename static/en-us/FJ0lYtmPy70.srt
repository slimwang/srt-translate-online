1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,310
There are some default behaviors on
the street view panorama object that you

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,200
can override, if you like.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,140
By default, street names
are written on the panorama.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,000
Zoom gestures to zoom in and
out are available and

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,360
user navigation is enabled.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,740
You can check and
set each of these using the following.

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,720
For street names,

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,880
you can call isStreetNamesEnabled, and
this will return a true or a false.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,400
To set the street name,
you can call setStreetNamesEnabled.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,630
And you pass that ability in true or
false to turn street names on or off.

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,300
For zoom gestures,
you call isZoomGestureEnabled

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,740
to check if it's on or off and
that will give you a true or a false.

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,160
And similarly,
you call setZoomGesturesEnabled and

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,460
pass that ability to turn them on or
off.

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,010
For user navigation,
you check isUserNavigationEnabled,

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,390
and this will return a true or a false.

17
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,250
And you call SetUserNavigationEnabled
to turn it on or

18
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,010
off, passing an ability true or false.

19
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,270
It's as simple as that.

20
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,330
Let's take a look at what this will
look like in an application, and

21
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,540
we'll see what it looks like with
street names on and streets names off.
