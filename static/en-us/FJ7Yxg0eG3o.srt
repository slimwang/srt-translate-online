1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is a true or false set of questions for Machine Learning.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Suppose we've trained a machine learning model,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and we've found really good values for our parameters in our model.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And now, we're going to increase the noise,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that affects our data.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What should we do to accommodate the increase of noise?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Shall we increase k, if we're using k nearest neighbor?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
True or False?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Increase k if we are using the k means algorithm.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
True or False?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Increase k if we are using Laplacian smoothing.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
True or False?

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Use fewer particles if we are using particle filters.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
True or False?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And use more data if available.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
True or False?
