00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:08,137
place your cursor right here just to the left of this x and inside this opening

00:00:08,137 --> 00:00:12,630
parenthesis, and get rid of the inner set parenthesis first. Or alternatively,

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,971
you could have started with the outer parenthesis, too. You put your cursor here

5
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:20,450
and then press Delete. And then, of course, go back to the inner one and do the

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,547
same thing. Order here does not matter as long as you're following this rule.
