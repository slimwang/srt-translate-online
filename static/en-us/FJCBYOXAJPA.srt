00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,520
As we said at the beginning when we first introduced the chi-square test for

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,340
independence, we evaluate the relationship between two variables. In this case,

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:15,460
the type of verb used smashed, hit or control. And the response, yes or no. In

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,930
this case, we have a two by three contingency table. Two rows and three

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,240
columns. You've seen on our other lessons that testing for significance is only

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,210
part of the story. We should also measure the strength of the relationship

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,010
between these two variables. This is our measure of effect size. When we have a

8
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,200
contingency table that's greater than just a two by two matrix, we use Cramer's

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,014
V. This is also symbolized like this, and might be called Cramers phi

10
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:49,420
coefficient. This is equal to the square root of our chi square value divided

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:55,700
by the total number of subjects in our study, times k minus 1. K is the smaller

12
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,650
of the number of rows or columns. What would k be in this case?
