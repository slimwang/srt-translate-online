1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,010
So did you figure out what caused the error? Hopefully

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,200
you discovered that it was this one. The first query orders

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,770
by name. And then you added the inequality filter from

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,860
max attendees. So the first sort order is name, but it

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,510
should really be max attendees, because that's where we have

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,830
the inequality filter. Composite index not existing might be a problem

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,830
that you run into, but it isn't the problem this time.

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,430
Unless you deploy straight to app spot, in which case you've

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,120
got a couple of different errors going on. And again,

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,590
this is a problem you might run into. If you

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,470
try to filter, say, on max attendees greater than 100,

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,660
and seats available less than ten. Because then you'd be

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,240
using inequality filters on two different properties in a single

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,000
query. But in this case, this particular error should not

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,330
be the problem. We're only using an inequality filter on

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,550
a single property. So, here's the arrow in the API's

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,900
explorer, and you see it tells us exactly what the

18
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,800
problem is. First sort property must be the same as

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,220
property to which the inequality filter is applied. In your

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,629
query, the first sort property is main. But the inequality filter

21
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,800
is on max attendees. So when you get these kinds

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,600
of errors or any errors, don't be frightened by them, just

23
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,250
go ahead and read them. There's valuable information in the

24
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,860
errors that will pinpoint the problems and help you fix them.
