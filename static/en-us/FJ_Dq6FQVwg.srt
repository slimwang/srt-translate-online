1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,200
Unicode characters
are just plain awesome.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,570
As you just learned,
there are more than 110,000 characters.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,780
That is insane.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,210
In a moment, I want you to
explore some of them, because,

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,525
well they can certainly come in handy.

6
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:19,683
Why would you ever force the browser to
download an image when there's already

7
00:00:19,683 --> 00:00:22,670
a Unicode character that you can get for
free?

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,410
To explore them yourself, I recommend
checking out this drop-down menu

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,240
which gives you the chance to look
through all of the different categories.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,729
You can find things like emoticons.

11
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,280
Holy cow, look at all those cute
little emoticons that you get for

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,298
free, which you can use on any website.

13
00:00:38,298 --> 00:00:42,340
It's worth pointing out that in order to
use Unicode characters, you need to make

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,280
sure that you set your character
set to utf-8 inside your meta tag.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,020
See the instructor notes for
more details on this.

16
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,510
For this quiz, I want you to pretend
that you are making a music website.

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,030
Check out the link to the Unicode
character set that you can find in

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,400
the instructor notes.

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,070
Look through it and see if you can
find the symbol for the treble clef.

20
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,379
Once you've found it, try it out for
yourself and see if it works.

21
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,200
