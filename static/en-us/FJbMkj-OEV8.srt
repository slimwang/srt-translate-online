00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, so now that you've seen an example, let's do a quiz makes things a bit more general.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
For this quiz we have two sets--A and B.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A is represented by the blue circle, B by the red.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I want you to match the set operation, and these are the four set operations.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to the appropriate Venn diagram.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I've shaded in in each of these diagrams a section,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and that section corresponds to one of these operations.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I want you to enter the appropriate number into the appropriate box.
