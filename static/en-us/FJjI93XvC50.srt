1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,678
Since the mean is supposed to be the same as the population mean, then it will

2
00:00:05,678 --> 00:00:11,051
be one of these two. So, which one of these looks to have a standard deviation

3
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:17,659
of about 2.71? For this wider one, the standard deviation looks like it's at

4
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:23,556
least 5. So, this is the correct sampling distribution. So, why is knowing the

5
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:29,071
shape of the sampling distribution important? Well, first of all, let's say we

6
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,546
want to increase our klout score.
