1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's now apply what we just learned in the context of computing an actual confidence interval.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Suppose I care about 90% confidence and from my coin flips,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I get a data sequence of 5 elements 11000 and let's for now assume you're going to use the T table.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This might not be the world's most accurate method but for now we do this.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now we've computed the variance many times. I'm just going to give it to you.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This 0.24 and if I knew this five takes the square root of the variance over n is about 0.219.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You compute this so many times, these are just the numbers, but I want you to give me

8
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is the confidence intervals, which is the mean plus or minus the term on the right.
