00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,274
So our next step is to multiply by the LCD divided by the LCD, or really just a

2
00:00:05,274 --> 00:00:10,219
form of one. So you do this multiplication. What would be the new numerator by

3
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:15,224
multiplying this by kr, and what would be our new denominator, by multiplying

4
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:16,627
this by kr? Good luck.
