00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,980
Hi and welcome to Udacity's Data
Analyst Nanodegree Program.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,090
I'm Caroline Buckey.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,244
And before I joined Udacity, I did a
combination of software engineering and

4
00:00:08,244 --> 00:00:09,080
machine learning.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,287
Now, there's more data in the world
today than there ever has been,

6
00:00:12,287 --> 00:00:13,797
and it's constantly growing.

7
00:00:13,797 --> 00:00:16,971
From sources like transaction records,
sensor data,

8
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:20,279
even people taking photos or
videos on their cell phones,

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,360
we're collecting more than 2.5
quintillion bytes of data every day.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,830
Because of this, data analysts
have never been in higher demand.

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,180
By completing this Nanodegree program,
you'll have the qualifications you need

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,440
to either start or
advance your career as a data analyst.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,050
And you'll build a portfolio
of projects to prove it.

14
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,860
To start out, you'll use statistics
to analyze the Stroop effect,

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,480
a classic result in
experimental psychology.

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,550
Then you'll go through the entire
data analysis process,

17
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,430
starting by posing a question and
finishing by sharing your findings.

18
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,035
Then you'll hone in on your data
wrangling skills by cleaning

19
00:00:53,035 --> 00:00:55,540
OpenStreetMap data for
a part of the world you care about.

20
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,850
Next you'll use exploratory data
analysis techniques to build intuition

21
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,210
about a data set by exploring
both individual variables and

22
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,245
how those variables interact.

23
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:06,660
You'll also use machine learning and

24
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,130
natural language processing to uncover
fraud in the infamous Enron scandal.

25
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,160
You'll create an effective data
visualization that will tell an engaging

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,900
and unforgettable story for
your audience.

27
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,890
And finally you'll analyze an A/B test
that Udacity ran, recommend whether or

28
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,550
not to launch the change, and
propose your own follow-up experiment.

29
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,590
>> Building these
projects won't be easy.

30
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,611
We're going to challenge you so

31
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:30,820
that you're prepared to solve tough
problems and think independently.

32
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,710
To rise to that challenge, you'll need
to keep up with your learning schedule

33
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,060
and engage with your
Nanodegree community.

34
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,290
Your fellow students are here to help
you untangle the trickiest puzzles,

35
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,140
get over the biggest hurdles, and
encourage you through all of it.

36
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,150
And when they need help,
you'll do the same for them.

37
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,930
The Udacity team will be here
too to deepen your learning,

38
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,185
offer project feedback, and
help you develop professionally.

39
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:54,525
By leveraging the support systems and
working consistently, you can prepare

40
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:58,425
yourself for an entirely new stage of
your career in a matter of months.

41
00:01:58,425 --> 00:02:00,795
We can't wait to see where
your Nanodegree takes you.
