1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,150
Alright, I'm going to hit you with a definition first.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:02,650
>> Hit me.

3
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,270
>> So, conditional independence is this idea that goes

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,220
like this. We're going to say that some variable that

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,860
makes up the joint distribution is conditionally independent of

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,250
some other variable, Y, given Z, if it's the

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,900
case of the probability distribution governing X, so the

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,150
probabilities associated with the values in this variable X

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,490
Is independent of the value of y given the value of z. So if I tell you what

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,590
z is, then you can figure out what the probability of x

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,420
is without having to look at y. So that is, if it's

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,660
the case that for all possible values, little x, little y and

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,640
little z for the variables big x, big y, and big z, If

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,110
it's the case that the probability that big X, the random variable

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,170
big X, equals, takes on the value of little x, given that

16
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,130
big Y takes on the value of little y and big Z

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,690
takes on the value of little z, equals the probability that big X

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,970
takes on the value of x given big Z takes

19
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,270
on the value of z. If those are equal for all

20
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,020
possible ways of filling in the values of the variables,

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,100
then we say that x is conditionally independent of y given

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,065
z. Right, so you see we dropped Y from the

23
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,640
right-hand side of the probability expression. Okay, so it's sort of

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,730
less things we have to worry about, if it's the

25
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,610
case that we really didn't need it in the first place.

26
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,160
>> Fewer.

27
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,000
>> Fair enough.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,900
>> So that's pretty similar

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,400
to normal independence. Okay, so what's normal independence?

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,210
>> So normal independence, we say the probability of x and y

31
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,040
is equal to the probability of x times the probability of y.

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,430
>> That's right.

33
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,820
>> Which means if we think about the chain rule, we

34
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,580
also know that the probability of x and y is equal

35
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,920
to the probability of x given y times the probability of

36
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,000
y. So that means that the probability of x given y is

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,120
equal to the probability of x, for all values of x and y.

38
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,720
>> So this is actually implying. So [INAUDIBLE] if it

39
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,200
equals that. Oh, that means that P(x) times P(y) equals

40
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,630
P(x given y) times P(y). If we cancel those, we

41
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,850
get px equals. Okay. That's what you wanted to say.

42
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,950
>> Right. So, since, What independence means,

43
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,520
right, is that the joint distribution between two

44
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,525
variables is equal to the product of their

45
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:06,220
marginals. That's just. You know comes from basic

46
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,440
probability theory and so if you think about what that means

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,220
from the chainable point of view it's like saying the probability of

48
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,910
x given y is equal to the probability of x. So,

49
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,140
it looks just like the equation you wrote down for conditional independence.

50
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,620
>> Right, the only thing that we added is this notion that it might

51
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,390
be the case that we don't have such a strong property as this where

52
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,060
it's always the case that you can write the probability of x given y

53
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,410
just with the probability of x. But in the context of some, of knowing

54
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,925
some value z, it might be true. And that's what conditional

55
00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:36,940
independence gives us. As long as there is some z that we

56
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,100
stick in here, that gives us that property, that's great, we can

57
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,630
essentially ignore y, when we are talking about the probability of x.

58
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,700
>> Okay, that's pretty cool. That means more powerful or something.

59
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,592
>> Yeah, and in fact if you remember you mentioned the

60
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:50,130
word factoring. You can see here that we are down a

61
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,020
probability as the product of two other things. We are factoring

62
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,730
that probability distribution. That's what

63
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,800
independence lets us do. And conditional

64
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,970
independence let's us do that in, in more general circumstances. So

65
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,690
let's apply this content back to what we were talking about before.

66
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,240
>> Okay.
