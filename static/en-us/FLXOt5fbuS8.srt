1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,768
In the previous morsel we mentioned several signals.

2
00:00:02,768 --> 00:00:08,160
For this quiz, I will ask you to look at the most recent POSIX standard, and

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,930
then indicate the correct signal names for the following events.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,620
The events are terminal interrupt signal,

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,430
second, high bandwidth data is available on a socket.

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,010
Next background process attempting to write.

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,860
And the last event to look at is file size limit exceeded.

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,100
Note that a link to the most recent POSIX standard is provided in

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,950
the instructor notes.
