Well, the greeting will be Hello World, the text that's enclosed inside these

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:11,107
quotes. Let me show you how that works. I will be using this programming

3
00:00:11,107 --> 00:00:17,510
environment, called BlueJ. BlueJ is a great environment for learning Java, and

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,590
I hope you have a chance to download and install it on your computer. If not,

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,734
it's okay. You can use a simpler environment that's a part of the web course.

6
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:29,660
BlueJ is really nice, and I really encourage you to go ahead and download it.

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,070
You'll find a link with installation instructions in the instruction notes. We

8
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,500
also gave you all of the code that we're using in this class, so you should

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,540
download that too.
