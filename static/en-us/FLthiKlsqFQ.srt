00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Our next question from student, MTRTMK, from Pakistan.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This student asks, "What are some good programming practices,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and how important is it to follow programming practices

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
used by professionals--things related to like

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
naming variables, commenting the code,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
being consistent with the structure--things like that?"

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So this is a great question.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There are definitely many things that people learn

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
as they get more experienced in programming.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We're focused, in this class, on learning the basic concepts--

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
on getting you able to write and understand short programs.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm trying to use good practices in most of the programs

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and, hopefully, those will come across.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But people have different opinions about the right way to code things.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Some opinions are better than others.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I think, in most cases, the opinions that I have are reasonably good ones.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Most cases--not always. >>Most of the time--we hope.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And you'll develop your own style.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You'll develop your own experience

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
as you get more experience as a programmer--how you like to do things--

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
but there are conventions that it's useful to follow,

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and part of the reason it's useful to follow conventions

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
is you want it so other programmers can understand your code.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And things like using lower case names--

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
using lower cased letters at the start of a variable name

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
are just conventions, and that's used to distinguish

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
variable names from other things you might see in a program.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There's no really good reason for that, but that's

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
a convention that most programmers follow,

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and it's good for you to follow it too so

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
if other people need to read your code

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
they'll be able to the code as well.
