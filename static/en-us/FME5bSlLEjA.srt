1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,570
Let's look into the project and
give it a try.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,500
If we look over here in our outline,

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,380
we can see our three text fields and
our label.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,400
And if we select a text field and

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,700
look in the identity inspector, you can
see that its class is UI Text field.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,420
None of these views have custom classes.

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,406
Now, let's close these windows.

8
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,600
And switch back to
the project navigator.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,070
Here, you can see the emoji
text field delegate and

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,880
the colorizer text field delegate.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,440
They each have a class to themselves but

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,279
you're probably wondering
where the third delegate is.

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,180
Here in the view controller.swift file,
you can see that our

14
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,560
main view controller is also
a UI text field delegate.

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,470
It's going to be the delegate for
the character counter.

16
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,990
If we look a little closer at
our view controller.swift file,

17
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,110
you can see here are the outlets for
our four views.

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,880
And here are the two delegates and
if we scroll down here, to viewDidLoad.

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,760
We can see that each of the delegates
gets assigned to a text field.

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,780
And that the delegate for the character
counter, gets assigned to self.

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,570
If we swap the delegates, the behavior
of the text field swaps as well.

22
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,300
You can see here that I have switched
the colorizer and the emoji delegates.

23
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,798
So, let's see how that affected
our text field behavior.

24
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:20,130
And here, you can see that
the behaviors have swapped.

25
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,860
The first text field is
acting as the colorizer and

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,000
the second text field is
acting as the emoji fire.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,920
We can do this because the three
text fields are identical.

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,170
The only difference is
supplied by the delegates.

29
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:32,910
In a little while,

30
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,190
we're going to trace the flow of control
through the objects in this app.

31
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,910
That way, we can see exactly how these
text fields interact with delegates,

32
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,870
using the UI text field
delegate protocol.
