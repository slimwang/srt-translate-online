1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,360
For Jesse Owens, that was an important state in his life.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,850
It was a state as far as the Olympics are concerned.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,010
And it turned out,

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,510
it was an important state as far as world events were concerned.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,600
The color magenta, however, is neither.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,170
It's not an event or it's not a state.

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,430
It's just the value of an attribute.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,610
The building's sprinkler system turning on due to a fire.

9
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,090
That's an event, an instantaneous change of state.

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,700
Telephone ringing is also an event.

11
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,500
Rainy day is a state.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,270
Big Ben chiming, now I know it takes a long time for it to chime, but

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,730
let's just think of it as being the start of chiming, that's an event.

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,370
Once again, an abstraction over that whole sequence of chimes.

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,230
The Inter, International Space Station is neither.

16
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,490
You can think of it as a very, very, very complex object itself.

17
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,840
And the screen saver on your laptop turning on, event.
