1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,630
So now our ViewController
should be all set.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,420
But our buttons still need some work.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,300
This button is an instantiation
of the UIButton class.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,170
It belongs to a category of view
objects called control objects.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,800
Control objects turn user actions
like finger taps into events.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,840
Now we need to create
an object inside this button

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,740
that will tell it to contact our
ViewController when it's clicked.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,020
We call this a target action, and

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,100
this is the word that IB action
is derived from in story word.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,190
This little target action holds
three key pieces of information.

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,310
An object to notify, the target,
the method to use, the action,

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,450
and the event that will
trigger the target action.

13
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,220
So now let's go back to Xcode and
implement our target action.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,840
We do this by invoking
a method on the button object.
