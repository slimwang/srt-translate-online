Hey Jeremy.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,520
>> Oh, hi Mark, just a second.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,330
>> What are you doing here?

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,080
>> I'm building the libraries
my app depends on.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,170
>> What?
>> I'm building the libraries my

6
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:11,770
app depends on.

7
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,690
I've got like eight Gradle projects
set up, and I've got to build them in

8
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,760
exactly the right order, making sure
each project's output is ready to be

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,950
consumed by the next project, then I
send them all over to this project here,

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,050
where they get built into my app.

11
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:23,910
>> Wow, impressive.

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,166
>> I know right, it's pretty spiffy.

13
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:29,160
>> Oh man, multi projects.

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,040
>> Oh no.
I know that face,

15
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,830
that's the face you make when Gradle can
automate something I've been working

16
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:34,840
hard to do on my own.

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,400
>> No no, keep it up.

18
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,090
>> Come on Mark, Gradle can
handle all this for me, right?

19
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,480
>> No, no, this is the way to do it.

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,930
>> Bro, don't hold out on me.

21
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,495
Come on, help me automate all this.

22
00:00:43,495 --> 00:00:45,420
>> All right,
let's set up the multi project build.

23
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:45,920
>> Thank you.
