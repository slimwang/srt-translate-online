00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,820
Congratulations, you've made your
first step towards a path in Android

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,160
programming.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,730
In this course, you will set up
Android Studio on your computer and

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,840
create the design layout for
an Android application using XML.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,040
As you dive into Android
app development,

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,930
there may be times where
you reach your strain zone.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,480
I encourage you to reach out for
support on the forums.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,840
By the end of this course, you should
have a better idea of whether Android

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,510
app development is the right path for
you.
