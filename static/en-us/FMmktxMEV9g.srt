00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,850
As we look through
AddressBookSpec.js file,

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,610
we can start identifying
some redundant code.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,880
We're having to set up our addressBook
and Contact in each of our specs.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,240
On the one hand, this is a good thing
because we're getting a nice clean slate

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,070
for each and every test.

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,640
On the other hand,
we're doing this manually.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,200
Thankfully, Jasmine offers a way for
us to define a function

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,020
that should be run before each and
every one of our tests.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,230
It's called the beforeEach function.

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,100
Let's refactor our spec real quick, so

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,330
we don't have to keep
repeating ourselves.

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,590
I've moved the addressBook and

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,250
thisContact, variable declarations,
up to the suite itself.

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,300
Remember, in JavaScript,

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,750
inner scopes have access to
variables declared in outer scopes.

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,690
So I know all of my specs will
have access to these variables.

17
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,320
Now all I need to do is
place my instantiation

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,767
within this beforeEach function.

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,170
Now, these two lines we'll
run before each of my test,

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,880
contained within this test suite.

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,810
You may ask yourself,

22
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,910
why didn't I move the addContact
line into beforeEach as well.

23
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,520
With just these two specs,
I could have done that.

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,280
It would have been fine, but I'm not
completely sure that adding a contact

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,810
is required functionality for any future
specs I may write within this suite.

26
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,990
For now I'm just going to keep those
lines right where they are, and

27
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,610
if I decide otherwise in
the future I can always move it up
