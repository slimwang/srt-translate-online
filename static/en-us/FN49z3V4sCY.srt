00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,520
In the last lecture I showed you this traditional old camera from 1950s.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,582
An important part of this camera is still that it has these lenses that

3
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:11,920
are used to focus the rays of light into the sensor chamber.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,510
This is a more recent digital SLR, this is the camera used these days.

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,709
And of course, it also has a lens.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,010
And one of the things that we will talk about in this lesson is what kinds of

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,860
things that a lens like this does.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,050
And of course, it has things like focal length, variety of things of

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,220
this lens actually then control the view that we actually get from the image or

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,000
from the scene that actually is represented on the image.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,410
And we also talk about things like what sensor sizes these types of

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,300
cameras have.

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,590
Varieties from digital SLRs to full frame ones

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,210
to simple cellphone cameras that we use.

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,390
We'll also talk about how images are formed and

16
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,370
also things like perspective projections.

17
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,480
The simple mathematical representations will be introduced to

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,710
show you how we can actually go from information in a real 3D world

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,470
to what's actually seen inside a camera.
