00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,670
Hi everybody, I'm Cameron Pittman.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,740
Welcome to this short course
on JavaScript promises.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,750
Every web developer needs to be
able to handle asynchronous work

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,900
with confidence and ease,
and that's why you're here.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,200
You're here to take advantage
of native JavaScript promises.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,240
There are many methods to handle
asynchronous work already.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,630
However, as you'll be
discovering in this course,

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,400
promises are the recommended option,
because they give you flexibility,

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,450
intuitive syntax, and
easy error handling.

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:33,259
But before we start all that,
I have an off topic question for you.

11
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:38,026
[SOUND] You're looking
at millions of stars in

12
00:00:38,026 --> 00:00:41,545
the disk of our Milky Way galaxy.

13
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:43,580
Every dot is a star.

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,500
Some are bigger and brighter than
the sun, others smaller and dimmer.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,410
But what else is in this picture?

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,300
Planets.

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,840
Every single star in the Milky Way
is the possible home for

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,830
dozens of alien worlds.

19
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,740
That means it's likely
that there are hundreds of

20
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,080
billions of planets in our galaxy alone.

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,550
The Kepler Space Observatory
has found more

22
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,140
than 1,000 exoplanets like this
one in the last few years.

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,400
Combined with data
from other telescopes,

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,000
astronomers have confirmed sightings
of almost 2,000 exoplanets.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,430
That's a lot of worlds.

26
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,880
I had an idea when I was
designing this class, and

27
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,690
I call it the Exoplanet Explorer.

28
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,090
It's a web app that helps people learn
about real planets around other stars.

29
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,120
Throughout this class, you'll be using
promises to request real JSON data about

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,910
exoplanets, and that data is
coming from NASA and CalTech.

31
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,720
You'll be using promises to turn that
data into useful information in the app.

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,690
Are you ready to get started?
