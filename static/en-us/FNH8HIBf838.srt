1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,703
So this is a lesson on
improving cache performance.

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:06,397
There are many methods for
improving cache performance, but

3
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:09,673
in general,
they can be grouped in three categories.

4
00:00:09,673 --> 00:00:14,351
And these three categories
have to do with

5
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:18,896
the average memory access time or AMAT,

6
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:25,992
which is equal to hit time + miss
rate x miss penalty of a cache.

7
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:30,416
So pretty much if we always hit,
we get the hit time.

8
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:35,625
If we miss, we get the miss penalty and
how often we miss is the miss rate and

9
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:41,250
the average memory access time as seen
by the processor is equal to this.

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,740
So the methods for

11
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:48,630
improving cache performance can be
those that try to reduce the hit time,

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,590
those that try to reduce the miss rate
or trying to reduce the miss penalty.

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,160
All of these would reduce the average
memory access time, which improves

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,770
the overall performance of the processor
when it needs to access the cache.
