1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:08,148
Well, you can see from the histogram that the most frequent age is between 20

2
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:18,418
minus 2.5 and 20 plus 2.5. In other words, from 17.5 to 22.5. The tallest bar

3
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:25,912
includes ages 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22, those are within this interval. And you can

4
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:33,021
see that the size is 5. So, if you said anything between 18 and 22 here, you're

5
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:33,795
correct.
