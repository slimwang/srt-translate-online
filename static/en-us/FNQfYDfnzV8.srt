1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,230
So that was how well humans could do.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,890
If you take a look at
how well machines do.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:06,760
Okay?

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,580
The SVMs performs better
than any single sub, or

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,470
I should say than every single subject.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,000
In other words, the machine was
better than the best person.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,704
Okay, and the overall performance,
you can see the SVM didn't care at all,

8
00:00:22,704 --> 00:00:26,200
really, about the low-res
versus the hi-res.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,160
In fact, it had slightly higher error
rates on the high resolution than low.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:31,990
Which and,

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,202
you know, could be that difference
is not statistically significant.

12
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:41,540
Unsurprisingly, the humans did
much better at the high resolution

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,760
remember we saw was 6% and the low
resolution, you know, they did awful.

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,480
So the machine did
better than the humans.

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,090
This is something we see a lot,
if you have lots of data to train.

16
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,810
The machine learning methods can
be quite sensitive to learning

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,610
the distinctions, sometimes
better than what, humans can do.

18
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,240
The one you have to be a little careful
of in this particular thing is,

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,870
remember that low resolution
image I showed you?

20
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,840
I don't, I, I, I went back and
I read the paper.

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,370
On the left is the original
48 by 84 image.

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:11,870
Okay?

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:20,260
In the middle is a, 12 by,
is the 12 by 21 image that they showed.

24
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,960
But of course,
it's blown up to be the same size,

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,610
and when you blow it up to be the same
size, you put these edges in here.

26
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,390
Now we talked about this.

27
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,350
Right?
What happens if you just replicate

28
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,530
the pixels?

29
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,240
Remember aliasing?

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,340
What you've done is you've,

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,950
you've put in these high frequency
things that really don't belong there.

32
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,190
If you were to smooth that image,
you would remove that aliased stuff, or

33
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,460
you could reconstruct it better, you'd
get a picture that looks like this.

34
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,350
And I'm going to guess that this
picture would have been easier for

35
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,970
humans to deal with than this picture

36
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,660
even though they have exactly the same
amount of information, right?

37
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,919
This picture is just the blurred
version of that one.

38
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,610
Okay?

39
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,380
So that, that's something to,
to remember.

40
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,280
In fact, let's do a quick
psychophysics experiment.

41
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,180
You ready?

42
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,230
All right,
can you recognize that picture?

43
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:19,770
Say no.
>> No!

44
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,320
>> Okay.

45
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,350
I'm going to take that same picture and
now I'm just going to blur it.

46
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,400
Can you recognize it now?

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,466
Do you remember the picture?

48
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:31,601
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

49
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:33,990
I'm going to make you get on camera.

50
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,330
On camera.

51
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,320
On camera, there you go.

52
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,090
So, so who is that?

53
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:38,690
>> That's you.

54
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,080
>> That's my, that's your hero,
you're supposed to say.

55
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,710
>> That's my hero.

56
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,640
>> There you go, yes.

57
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,500
That's just, that ugly puss is me.

58
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,760
Now you know when you were
looking at just this picture,

59
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,200
that was probably hard to tell.

60
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,930
So you have to be a little careful on
how you do things and you know, for

61
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,440
your psychophysics.

62
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,290
So that, that ends that digression.

63
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,810
By the way here were the hardest
examples for humans to classify, okay?

64
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,310
So you might take a look at them and,
and

65
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,370
try to decide what you think they are.

66
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,330
I'm not going to do that because
I don't know who they are and

67
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,030
I don't want to insult anybody.

68
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,920
These were the actual true examples.

69
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,140
I mean, sorry, the true labels.

70
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,440
So did you get them right?

71
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,810
I got one wrong.

72
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,480
I'm not going to tell you which.
