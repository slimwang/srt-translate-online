00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,430
So we now know how health data is shared
and how it is protected along the way.

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,195
But what about the data itself?

3
00:00:08,195 --> 00:00:10,157
How is it represented?

4
00:00:10,157 --> 00:00:13,180
How is it packaged into documents?

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,680
And how are those documents
actually transmitted?

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,160
For that,
we now turn to lessons five A and

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,090
B on data and
interoperability standards.
