1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,980
To start off with here's the native
version of my check out form.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,070
See how it looks kind
of material designee?

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,350
The reason why is because I want to
building the polymer version first

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,410
because to be honest my design
skills aren't really that great.

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,310
I wanted to apply some material
design best practices and

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,660
then I just copied the results
over using native HTML.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,930
With this version I actually kept
a few of the original inputs, but

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,950
I did do as much as I could to
get rid of as many as possible.

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,570
I also made the language
a little bit friendlier.

10
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,020
And I did my best to make sure
that the form was pared down

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,630
to just the bare minimum.

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,440
I also make the assumption that
somebody wants to use the same

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,060
billing address as they used for
shipping.

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,450
That allows me to add this
check box which i like.

15
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,450
If somebody wants to use a different
billing address they simply click it and

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,370
then enter it.

17
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,830
You can see that I'm using
placeholders in lieu of labels.

18
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,070
But if you look in the source code,

19
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,130
you can see that the labels
are actually still there.

20
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,120
Screen readers need labels so

21
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,140
I wound up just simply hiding
them using a special CSS class.

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,469
This keeps them in the dom,
but they don't show up.

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,770
There's also a bit of
validation happening.

24
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:16,780
Among other things,

25
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,670
credit card numbers are being parsed
to find the type of credit card.

26
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,760
That's pretty helpful.

27
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,410
Of course,

28
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,960
this version doesn't quite follow all of
the best practices that you've learned.

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,490
I wound up ditching
the progress bar at the top and

30
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,450
I'm doing nothing to
help out with location.

31
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,940
And so here is the polymer
version that uses gold elements.

32
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,520
The similarities are obvious but

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,010
there are two big differences
that I want to point out.

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,440
First off, there's a nice progress
bar at the top that expands

35
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,780
as the user fills in
validated information.

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,650
And two, this version takes
advantage of a user's location.

37
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,000
Watch as I click in the address bar.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,950
The site wants to know if
it can use my location.

39
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,090
I wound up hooking up this
input to the Google Maps API.

40
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,290
Which allows me to auto complete
addresses as a user's typing.

41
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,300
And now that I have the address,
I'm also helping the user out

42
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,300
by giving them the zip code already
in the credit card information area.

43
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,760
And of course if the billing
address is different for

44
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,390
the credit card,
you simply click right here.

45
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,940
And the browser scrolls down to
show you a new address input, nice.

46
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,030
There are a few other changes that I
made so I encourage you to check out

47
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,010
the source code which you can find
a link to in the instructor notes.

48
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,290
So how did your checkout
forms compared to mine?

49
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,450
Think you did better?

50
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,290
If you haven't already,
share yours in the forum.

51
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,620
In the next lesson you'll be
practicing with mobile form techniques.

52
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,560
Before then, here's the next part
of the interview series with Luke

53
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,450
where he'll discuss mobile first.
