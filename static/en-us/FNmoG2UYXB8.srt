00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,112
Our job here is to figure out how many of these pictures are in portrait

2
00:00:03,112 --> 00:00:09,640
orientation. It's a counting task. We start by declaring counter. Now, we want

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,948
to look through all of the elements of the array list. And since we want to go

4
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:18,750
through all of them, we can use the enhanced for loop. We consider the picture

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,239
a match if it's taller than it is wide. And it seems a good idea in this case

6
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:26,998
to make a comment to explain that. And when we do have a match, then we

7
00:00:26,998 --> 00:00:31,514
increment the counter, and that's all. When we run the program, we're told that

8
00:00:31,514 --> 00:00:35,701
there three matching pictures. It would be kind of nice to know which ones they

9
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:37,929
are, and we'll get to that soon.
