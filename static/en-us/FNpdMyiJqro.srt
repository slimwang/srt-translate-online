00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,650
Today we'll talk about another method of learning,

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,340
called learning by correcting mistakes. An agent reaches a decision.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,650
The decision turns out to be incorrect, or sub optimal. Why did the agent make

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,150
that mistake? Can the agent correct its own knowledge and reasoning so

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,170
that it never makes that same mistake again? As an example, I'm driving and

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,740
I decide to change lanes. As I change lanes, I hear cars honking at me.

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,400
Clearly I made a mistake. But what knowledge, what reasoning led to

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,800
that mistake? Can I correct it, so that I don't make the mistake again?

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,890
Learning to correct mistakes is our first lesson in meta-reasoning.

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,940
We'll start today by revisiting explanation-based learning. Then we'll use

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,590
the explanations for isolating mistakes. This will be very similar diagnosis.

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,300
Except that here we'll be using explanation for isolating mistakes.

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,170
This will make it clear, why explanation is so central to knowledge based AI.

14
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,360
Then we'll talk about how we can use explanations for correcting mistakes which

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,985
will set up the foundation for subsequent discussion on metareasoning.
