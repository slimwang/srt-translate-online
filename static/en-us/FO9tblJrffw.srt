So far we've talked about a lot of
numbers, both positive and negative, and

2
00:00:04,752 --> 00:00:09,430
our world of numbers is looking pretty
great. Still, we've really only been

3
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:14,380
counting by ones, whether above or below
0. This might be a problem however.

4
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:19,495
Thinking back to your famous birthday
party, what if your friend had baked a few

5
00:00:19,507 --> 00:00:24,560
cakes instead of making a ton of cupcakes?
If you asked someone how much cake they

6
00:00:24,572 --> 00:00:29,405
wanted and they only knew about integers,
they would have to say that they either

7
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:34,300
wanted no cake at all, or they wanted 1
whole cake, or maybe even 2 entire cakes.

8
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:38,990
This doesn't seem very practical and
you'll also run out of cake very quickly.

9
00:00:39,092 --> 00:00:43,990
You would probably want to cut each cake
into slices and then give each person just

10
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:49,587
a piece of the cake. Let's say that you
cut 1 of the cakes into 8 pieces. If you

11
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:55,203
gave 5 friends each 1 of those slices, how
much of that cake would be left over?
