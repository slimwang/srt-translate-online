1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,330
So for the stack question.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,230
You'll often see where I think Sam was
very good about having an answer and

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,110
kind of having a solution to begin with,
but,

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,760
I would have liked if you asked a few
more of kind of follow up questions I

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,410
think we've described a very naive
solution well I needed a good job there.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,290
You'll see a lot of times where people

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,870
expect to have to write
an entire class from scratch.

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,440
So I think Sam initially thought okay,

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,890
well I'm going to have to write entire
stack class and then go on from there.

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,610
You should ask your interviewer
what level of detail they want.

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,320
And also when you're writing the code,

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,010
you should also ask what
they're looking for.

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,830
If they want syntax perfect code,
then write syntax perfect code.

14
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,590
But in this case I didn't really care.

15
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,910
I cared more about the implementation
and the structure.

16
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,220
And so I think Sam could probably go
through and ask me a few more questions

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,040
about the level of detail I wanted,
because I was perfectly fine with him

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,980
using the Java util stack, but he felt
he would need red zone in the beginning.

19
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,500
So that's a part where
maybe he could follow up.
