1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,460
Let's get some more practice working with data frames. You downloaded

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,830
an R script earlier and saw how we can save our

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,810
work and run an R code from it. For your next

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,010
task, you're going to download an RMD file and run code in

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,720
it. You can download the RMD file from the link in

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,850
the instructor notes. The file will look something like this. Notice

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,260
how this file is slightly different from the file that you

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,210
saw before. An R script can only have R code and comments.

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,130
This file, however, the RMD file, allows us to do

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,560
so much more. It's an R Markdown document, or RMD.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,110
Now, you might be wondering what R Markdown is. And

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,350
basically, it's a simple formatting language that lets us author web

13
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,790
pages. If you want to know all you can do with

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,020
Markdown then go to Help and then go to Markdown Quick

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,210
Reference. This would bring up the documentation for Markdown, and

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,080
you can scroll through some of the examples in the formatting.

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,660
We've also included a video in the instructor notes that will

18
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,810
go through Markdown. So far this file only contains text that

19
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,830
will be formatted using Markdown. Let's add some R code to

20
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,530
this. We can do this by clicking on Chunks and then

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,198
going to Insert Chunk. Now if you're friendly with the keyboard,

22
00:01:07,198 --> 00:01:10,921
you can use the shortcut Cmd+Option+I. There's many other shortcuts in

23
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:13,475
here and you can see them here in this menu. Here

24
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:16,284
I've added some code to see what this data set is.

25
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,164
This is the cars data set that also comes with R,

26
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:23,628
and it contains 50 observations of speeding and stopping distances for

27
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:26,829
cars in the 1920s. I'm going to add this text as the

28
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:30,447
title to this document, so that way it's more descriptive of my

29
00:01:30,447 --> 00:01:32,916
file. I'll also run the Stir command on this data frame,

30
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,012
so that way I can see what's inside of it. It looks

31
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:38,261
like I have two variables, speed and distance, which are measured

32
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:41,390
in miles per hour and feet. Not only can we run R

33
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,310
code and get the output from these files, we can

34
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,090
also embed images. This plot function comes with a base

35
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,130
graphics package in R. But don't worry learning more about

36
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,180
it. We'll be using the ggplot two package which is

37
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,220
a powerful graphics language in the coming lessons. When I

38
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,555
run this code I get a simple plot of speed

39
00:01:58,555 --> 00:02:02,550
versus distance. Now, what's really amazing about this document is

40
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,470
that we can click the Knit HTML button. This will generate

41
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,620
a web page that includes both content, as well as the output

42
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,650
of any embedded R code. This simple button allows us to easily

43
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,010
share and publish our work. That's enough about RMD files. Let's have

44
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,310
you work in one now. Download the RMD file if you haven't already,

45
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,760
and run and write code when you're prompted to to so. At

46
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,490
the end of the file, you'll come across a question. I want you

47
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,390
to answer that question for this next quiz. And then you can

48
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,300
continue on with the rest of the lesson. Good luck and have fun.
