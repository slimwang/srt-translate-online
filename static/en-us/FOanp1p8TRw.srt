1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,540
So let's look at the whole
concept of parallax.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,800
So from these two eyes, if I was looking
at a scene, and here I'm just going to

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,070
create a synthetic scene here, and
I'm going to put a object like a star.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,660
If the left eye was looking at the
object, that basically would mean that

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,580
a ray of light is coming out
from here and going there.

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,480
And of course,
coming from this one would go here.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,020
So the ray of light actually going in to
capture the scene from the right eye,

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,890
of course sees the star and
of course has got the red background.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,310
Which actually, would then actually
show an image like this, right?

10
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,500
Because there's a red background,
there's a star in front of it,

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,940
this is what you'd see
from the right eye.

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,210
The left eye on the other hand,
would see, this.

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,510
So one of the observations
that are important for

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,980
understanding the concept of parallaxes.

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,810
That points at different depths,
will displace differently.

16
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,060
We'll get to that in a second, but

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,590
you basically see that now both these
eyes are seeing something different.

18
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,940
And that's the kind of point that
we want to make here to kind of

19
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,245
understand what's going on.

20
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:02,070
Parallax, which we'll talk about in
a bit, basically kind of says is,

21
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,880
because of this feature, that if
this thing was further back here,

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,800
it would display differently,
or look differently as

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,590
I would actually look at this
object in relationship to it.

24
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,200
And similarly, on the other hand,

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,640
if objects were closer,
they would look different to.

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,890
So here, basically you see the
relationship that because it's in front

27
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,980
of it, it looks different because of
the fact the background is different.

28
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,520
In case of course both of them
are the same distance, but

29
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,250
if they were different you can
actually see the difference

30
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,420
that it'll have in our
perception of depth.
