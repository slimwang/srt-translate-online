00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,840
Most views in Android will stick
to a few simple text styles and

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:06,407
colors that will repeat
throughout the code.

3
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:10,550
Like for each of the listed activities
on the main screen of our app.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,100
Each view is the same color with
the same text size and color.

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,782
And it will be tedious
to go into our xml and

6
00:00:16,782 --> 00:00:19,980
type in the same property values for
each of these.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,789
So instead, Android gives us a way to
group properties like the color and

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,919
size of a view, as a style or theme.

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,370
A style is an xml resource file,
found in the values folder,

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,710
where you can set all of these
properties in one place.

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,539
Then later we can apply that
one style to any view we want.

12
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:39,890
And the theme is created
in the same way.

13
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,399
A theme is just a style that's applied
to an entire activity or application and

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,170
not just one view.

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,740
For our next task, we'll go through how
to create and apply styles to our app.
