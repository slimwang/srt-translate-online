1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,160
And the correct answer is output, in that we are allowed to

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,310
have arbitrary input values, but the outputs tend to be binary.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,640
For example, slow and fast.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,670
Now this kind of output is called discrete, but

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,263
in many learning problems, your output could be continues as well.

6
00:00:16,263 --> 00:00:20,520
So for example, if the input is the height of a person, and you put it output is

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,590
the weight, then what you find is probably a function like this.

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,890
It says that the taller a person, the more a person weights.

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,290
And in this case the output is not a binary concept like, light or heavy.

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,470
It's a continuous concept, and the output itself is also continuous.

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,140
So this is what we call continuous supervised learning
