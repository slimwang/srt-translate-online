1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,240
>> Okay Michael, what's the answer?

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:02,869
>> Does he have spleentitis?

3
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:04,070
>> Yes, does he have spleentitis?

4
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,020
>> I don't think we know, for sure.

5
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,570
>> Mm? What do mean by that?

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,690
>> Well, I mean. It's a noisy and probabilistic world right. So the

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,100
test told us that things look like he has spleentitis and the test

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,180
is usually right. But the test is sometimes wrong and it can give

9
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,460
the wrong answer and that's really all we know, so we can't be sure.

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,290
>> Okay but if you had to pick one. If you had to yes or

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,270
no, like our students they did when they took

12
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,990
the quiz. Which one would you pick? Yes or no.

13
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,890
>> So, I guess C the pants. I would just say, yes because the

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,780
test says, yes but if I guess I was trying to be more precise, I

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,740
may go through and work out the probability and I guess if it's more

16
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,700
likely to have than not to have, then I'd say and otherwise I'd say, no.

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,970
>> Okay. So how would you go about doing that? Walk me through it.

18
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,690
>> Based on the name of the quiz, I think I'd go with Bayes' Rule.

19
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,980
>> Okay. So [LAUGH]

20
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,230
I like that. So Bayes' Rule, is everyone recall, is

21
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,970
the probability of the hypothesis given the data is equal to

22
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,870
the probability of the data given the hypothesis times the probability

23
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,702
of the hypothesis divided by the probability of the data. So,

24
00:01:02,702 --> 00:01:02,970
>> [LAUGH]

25
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:08,980
>> Let's write all that out. So what is the probability of spleentitis,

26
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,510
which I'm just going to write as an s. Given.

27
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,028
>> We're making jokes about spleentitis, but we

28
00:01:16,028 --> 00:01:19,210
don't want that to be confused with splenitis,

29
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,350
which is a real thing and probably not very

30
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,460
pleasant. So apologies to anyone out there with splenitis.

31
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,040
But this is spleentitis, which is really totally different.

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,720
>> Is splenitis a real thing?

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:28,870
>> Yeah.

34
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,260
>> :Really what is it?

35
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,660
>> Enlargement and inflammation in the spleen and the spleen as

36
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:40,110
a result of infection or possibly a parasite infestation or cysts.

37
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,120
>> So what you're saying

38
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,720
is that's gross and we don't want to think about it. OK good so Woo okay, so the

39
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,390
probability of getting splentitis and again is a very rare thing and probably isn't even real.

40
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,680
>> Totally, its totally different, its definitely not real

41
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,850
>> Yea definitely not. Given that we gotten a positive result and you say

42
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,330
that we should use Baye's rules so that would be in this case what?

43
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,170
>> So it's the same as

44
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,420
the probability of the positive result given that you have spleentitis.

45
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,723
>> Mm-hm.

46
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:15,620
>> Times the probability, the prior probability of having spleentitis.

47
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:15,821
>> Mm-hm.

48
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:21,330
>> And I want to say normalize, but like

49
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,970
divided by the probability of a positive test result.

50
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,180
>> And what would be, the probabili. The other option is that you

51
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,930
don't have spleentitis.

52
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,893
>> Mm-hm.

53
00:02:33,893 --> 00:02:38,430
>> Even though you got a positive result. And that would be equal to?

54
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,920
>> The probability of a positive result given you don't have spleentitis.

55
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,550
>> Mm-hm.

56
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,690
>> Times the prior probability of not having spleentitis.

57
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:47,780
>> huh.

58
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,940
>> Divided by the, again the same thing. The probability of the

59
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,260
test results. So that's, those two things added together, needed to be one.

60
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,140
>> Right.

61
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,630
But as you point out. If we just want to figure out which

62
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,820
one is bigger than the other. We don't actually have to know this.

63
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,700
>> Hm, good point.

64
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,990
>> So we can ignore it, okay. Okay, so, let's compute this. So, what

65
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:12,030
is in fact, the probability of me getting a plus, given that I have spleenitis?

66
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,790
>> Right. So it says in the setup, the

67
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,780
test results correct positive 98% of the time. So,

68
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,540
I, I think that's what it means. It means

69
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,160
that if you really do have it, it's going to

70
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,160
say that you have it with that probability.

71
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,110
>> Okay, so That's just point nine eight. OK? And

72
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,400
that's times the prior probability of having spleentitis which is?

73
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,784
>> .008.

74
00:03:32,784 --> 00:03:33,700
>> Right. .008.

75
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:37,780
And what's that equal to?

76
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,114
>> It is equal to. 0.0078.

77
00:03:41,114 --> 00:03:43,568
>> 0.00784.

78
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:47,510
>> Okay, fine. We can do the same thing over here. So

79
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,870
what's the probability of getting a positive if you don't have spleentitis

80
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,780
>> So, the probability of a correct negative is 97%.

81
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,790
That means if you really don't have it, it's going to

82
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,120
say you don't have it, so probability of positive result

83
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,073
given that you don't have it, that should be the 3%.

84
00:04:02,073 --> 00:04:04,730
>> That's exactly right. Times the prior

85
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,309
probability of not having spleentitis which is?

86
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:11,757
>> .992. 1- .008.

87
00:04:11,757 --> 00:04:15,290
>> That's right, and that is equal to?

88
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,095
>> .02976

89
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:17,750
>> So, which number is bigger?

90
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,880
>> The one that has the larger significant digit.

91
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,010
>> Which one of those two is that?

92
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,720
>> I mean, obviously, the one that's bigger is the, you don't have it.

93
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,110
>> That's right.

94
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,180
So the answer would be no.

95
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,533
>> And in fact the probability is almost 80%.

96
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:34,180
>> Yeah.

97
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,610
>> Which is crazy. So, it's like, you go into the doctor, you've run a

98
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,860
test, the doctor says congratulations, you don't

99
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,510
have speentitis, because the test says you do.

100
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,887
>> That's right. [LAUGH]

101
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:45,260
>> So, what does that tell you?

102
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:45,900
>> That seems stupid.

103
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,190
>> That does seem stupid, but what does

104
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,345
it tell you About Bayes' Rule. What is

105
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:51,240
Bayes' Rule capture. What is thing that make

106
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,270
the answer no, despite the fact, you have

107
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,010
a high reliability test that says yes.

108
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,740
>> I. Okay. So I guess, I guess the way to

109
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,220
think about it is, a random person showing up in the

110
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,480
doctors office, is very unlikely to have this particular disease. And

111
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,210
even the tiny, little, small percentage probability that the test would give

112
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,170
a wrong answer is completely swamped by the fact that you

113
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,150
probably don't have the disease. But I guess this isn't really factoring

114
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,430
in the idea that, you know, presumably this lab test was

115
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,280
run for some other reason. There was some other evidence that there

116
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,460
was concern.

117
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,450
>> Or the doctor just really wanted some

118
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,620
more money, because She needs a new boat.

119
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,810
>> Yeah, I know a lot of doctors.

120
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,790
>> I do too.

121
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,680
>> And most of them don't work like that.

122
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,780
>> Yeah most, well most of them have PhD's not MD's. So, another

123
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,760
way of summarizing what you just said Michael, I think, is that priors matter.

124
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,800
>> I want to say the thing that I got out of this is tests don't matter.

125
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,560
>> Well, tests matter.

126
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,050
>> Like what's the purpose of running a

127
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,950
test if if it's going to come back and say.

128
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,870
Well it used to be that I was pretty sure you didn't

129
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,120
have it and now I am still pretty sure you don't have it.

130
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,760
>> Well the point of running a test is

131
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,370
you run a test when you have a reason to

132
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,170
believe that the test might be useful. So what is

133
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,680
the one thing, if I could only change one thing

134
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,740
without getting completely ridiculous, whats the easy well, I

135
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,040
don't know whats easy, whats the easiest thing for me

136
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,030
to change about this setup. I have three numbers here.

137
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,090
This one, this one and this one. What would be

138
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,270
the easiest number to change?

139
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,490
>> Well, in some sense none of the seem

140
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,320
that easy to change but I guess maybe what

141
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,160
you're trying to get me to say is that

142
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,450
if we look at a different population of people

143
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,740
then we can change that .008 number to something

144
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,190
else, like if we only give the test to

145
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,270
people who have other signs of spleentitis. Then then

146
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,660
it, it would probably be a much bigger number.

147
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,330
>> Right, so changing the test, making the test better

148
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,110
might be hard, presumably you know, billion of dollars of

149
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,020
research have gone into that, but if you don't give the

150
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,050
test to people who you don't have any reason to believe

151
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,640
have Spleentitis, just walking off the street, as you put it,

152
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,340
a random person walking off the street, then you can change

153
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,280
the priors, so some other evidence. That you might have splentitis

154
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,800
would lead the prior to change, and then the test would

155
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,870
suddenly be useful. So this, by the way, is an argument

156
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,140
for why you don't want to just require that everyone take

157
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,010
tests for certain things. Because if the prior probability is low, then

158
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,590
the test isn't very useful. On the other hand, as soon as

159
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,700
you have any reason to believe We have strong evidence that someone

160
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,120
might have some condition, then it makes sense to test them for it.

161
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,120
>> So it's like a stop and frisk situation.

162
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,570
>> It's exactly like a stop and frisk

163
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:20,590
situation. I'm looking at you [INAUDIBLE]. Okay But in

164
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,230
some sense, you're use of the word prior

165
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,330
is a little confusing there. So it's not that

166
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,160
we're changing the prior, it's that we're...we have

167
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,130
some additional evidence that we can factor in. And

168
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,570
I guess we can imagine that that's part

169
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,790
of the prior, but it seems like it's posterior.

170
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,340
>> Yeah, it does. And it, but... One way

171
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,850
to think about it, you actually, I think you

172
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,170
just captured it in what you just said, right?

173
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,990
Which is you can think of as a prior. Well,

174
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,850
a prior to what? So it's your prior belief

175
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,560
over a set of hypotheses, given the world you happen

176
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,070
to be in. If you're in a world where

177
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,810
random people walk in to take a test for splentitis,

178
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,320
then there's a low prior probability that they have it. If you're in a world

179
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,800
where the only people who come in are people who are from a population where

180
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,580
the prior probability is significantly higher, then

181
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,620
you would have a different prior. It's really

182
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,060
a question about where you are in

183
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,520
the process when you actually formulate your question.

184
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,210
>> So would it be worth asking people how, how likely would it have to be

185
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,280
that you have spleentitis to make this test

186
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,990
at all useful? Right, that would change a

187
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,690
positive, a positive result would actually change

188
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,620
your mind about whether someone has it.

189
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,660
>> yeah, actually that, I think that's something that I,

190
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,790
I'll leave for the for the, for the interested reader,

191
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,940
where would that prior probability have to change so that

192
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,880
getting a positive result, I would be more likely to believe

193
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,950
that you actually have it than not. That does bring

194
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,120
up a philosophical question, though, which is So what, just because

195
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,919
the priors have changed, doesn't mean that suddenly the test

196
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,030
is useful, or that the test is going to give you an

197
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,669
answer that somehow distinguishes and is this positive. And from

198
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:46,760
a mathematical point of view, the question of whether this

199
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,410
number is 0.008 or, or 0.8, you know, 8 10ths

200
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,922
of a percent, where does it change? Does it change

201
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:55,890
at 5%? Or does it change at 50%? Or does

202
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,210
it change at 500%? It probably changes at 500%. You

203
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,270
know, what, where is the place in which suddenly a

204
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:06,010
positive result would make you believe they actually had spleentitis or

205
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,780
whatever disease you're looking for. Okay?

206
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,570
>> Okay.
