00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,819
We saw at the end of the last lesson that we could come up with a function for

2
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:09,717
the area of a rectangle by saying that A of l,w equals lw. The product of the

3
00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:14,604
length and width of any rectangle. Well, in our case, l and w are going to be

4
00:00:14,604 --> 00:00:20,285
represented by a different variable, actually. They're both written already in

5
00:00:20,285 --> 00:00:25,646
terms of x. I'm going to call this the length and this width. So in our case the

6
00:00:25,646 --> 00:00:30,947
length is actually just x plus x, or 2x plus 3. Remember that the m here stands

7
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:36,424
for meters, not a variable. And the width is just 2x. If we want to apply this

8
00:00:36,424 --> 00:00:41,635
out we get 4x squared plus 6x squared meters. So instead of writing the area as

9
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:45,928
a function of length and width, instead we're writing it as a function of x now.

10
00:00:45,928 --> 00:00:50,216
It's function that only involves only one variable since we had both of these

11
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,408
original variables in terms of the same third variable.
