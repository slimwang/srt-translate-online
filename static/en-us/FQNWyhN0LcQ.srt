00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,640
Okay, let's recap what we've
learned about Q-Learning.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,840
First, let's consider what
it takes to build a model.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,590
First step is define states,
actions, and rewards.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,780
So states are combinations
of our features.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,450
Actions are buy, sell, do nothing.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,760
And rewards are some type of return.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,320
Next you choose the training period and
you iterate over that

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,120
training period and
update your Q-table on each iteration.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,380
When you reach the end of that
training period you backtest

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,380
to see how good the model is and
you go back and

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,430
repeat, until the model
quits getting better.

12
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,600
Once it's converged you stop,
you've got your model.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,520
Testing the model is simple you
just backtest it on later data.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,610
Remember we're always training
on one set of data and

15
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,830
then testing on later data.

16
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,690
And that's it.

17
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:59,770
I hope you enjoyed the lesson.
