1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Pretty straightforward.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If we don't have at least 3 elements in the path, that means we don't have an action there.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's just an individual state. The cost of that should be 0.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Otherwise, we look at the second element from the end.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There's a final state and then there's a final action.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That should be the final action and total cost--this tuple--we just return the total cost.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For the bridge cost of an action, it's just the maximum of the two times.
