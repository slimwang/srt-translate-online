00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,843
Now we are ready to put all the subs together to get an answer. How many

2
00:00:02,843 --> 00:00:07,766
circles fits in a field that is 1900m wide and 4000m long. You can use any of

3
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:12,320
the information you have calculated so far, the total number of rows was 5. The

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,496
number of columns in an even row was 1. And the number of columns in an odd row

5
00:00:16,496 --> 00:00:21,555
was 2. The number of even rows was 2, and the number of odd rows was 3. If you

6
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:26,354
are getting stuck, think about how many of each type of row there are? And how

7
00:00:26,354 --> 00:00:28,489
many circles are in that type of row?
