1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,996
Here, the ranges were from negative infinity to negative 5, with the union of

2
00:00:03,996 --> 00:00:10,100
negative 1 to positive infinity. Great work if you found these two intervals.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,292
First, we want to find the values of p that make this equation true. We factor

4
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:18,068
to find the series of p and we get p is equal to negative 5, and p is equal to

5
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:23,268
negative 1. We use the values of negative 5 and negative 1 to create the three

6
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:27,720
intervals on our number line. For the first interval, I'm going to test the

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,188
value of negative 10. When I plug in at negative 10 for p, I'll get the

8
00:00:32,188 --> 00:00:37,400
statement 45 is greater than 0. I know this is true so I can include it, this

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,280
part or this interval, in my solution set. For interval II, I'll plug in the

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,422
value p equals negative 3. When we substitute this value in, we get the

11
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:51,429
inequality negative 4 is greater than 0. We know this is not true, so we can

12
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:56,148
include this interval in our solution set. And finally, for the third interval,

13
00:00:56,148 --> 00:01:00,876
we'll use the value p equals zero. If p equals zero, we lose these two terms

14
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:05,310
and are left with a statement 5 is greater than zero, which we know is true.

15
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,342
We'll use parentheses at negative 5 and negative 1, since we don't have the or

16
00:01:09,342 --> 00:01:15,151
equal to symbol here. So any value, from negative infinity to negative 5 or any

17
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:18,805
value from negative 1 to positive infinity will satisfy our original

18
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:24,508
inequality. Here's our answer on a number line, and here's our answer written

19
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:26,474
in interval notation.
