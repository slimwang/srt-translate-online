1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,237
>> Katie, I'm so unpopular. >> Don't worry, I am too. I only have 63 Facebook

2
00:00:05,237 --> 00:00:10,575
friends. >> Yeah, well I only have 54 Twitter followers. >> Well, the average

3
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:14,924
number of Facebook friends is 190, so I have 127 friends less than average.

4
00:00:14,924 --> 00:00:20,336
That's a lot. >> Well, the average number of Twitter followers is 208. >> So I

5
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:25,705
have 154 fewer Twitter followers. >> Ok. Well, let's look at the ratios. I have

6
00:00:25,705 --> 00:00:30,971
33% of the average number of Facebook friends. >> Yeah, but even looking at it

7
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:35,885
that way, I still only have 25% of the average number of Twitter followers. I am

8
00:00:35,885 --> 00:00:40,815
totally unpopular. >> I know what to do. Let's ask Chris. He has way more

9
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:45,459
Facebook friends than average. Well, a better way to look at popularity, would

10
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:49,349
be to look at the distributions. The distribution of facebook friends and

11
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:53,632
Twitter followers are normal. The standard deviation of Twitter followers is 60,

12
00:00:53,632 --> 00:00:57,536
but the standard deviation of Facebook friends is only 35. So, the number of

13
00:00:57,536 --> 00:01:01,253
standard deviations away from the mean is definitely a better way to look at

14
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:02,100
unpopularity.
