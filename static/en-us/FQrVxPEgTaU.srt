1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,090
Okay great.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,170
Now let's put it all together and
do some shell commands.

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,590
Each of the answers in this quiz will
involve globbing, but it'll also involve

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,480
remembering some of the other commands
you've learned in this course.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,830
For the first task, you'd like to back
up some files from the www directory

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:16,970
to the backup directory.

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,360
Our second goal is to list all the files
in the current directory that end in jpg

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,100
or png.

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,616
And our final goal is to print
the string Short names: followed by all

10
00:00:27,616 --> 00:00:31,440
the one-character filenames
in the current directory.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,280
These questions are pretty tricky.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,280
If you're having trouble,
head over to your terminal and

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,770
create a temporary directory
full of test files,

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,880
that way you can experiment and
try out your commands.
