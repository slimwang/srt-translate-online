00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,850
Now recall from the last lecture, we had looked at the insides of a camera.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:05,990
The lens assembly.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,670
Light goes in here.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,400
The shutter opens.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,470
Light hits the sensor, which could be the film or a digital sensor.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,530
Only when the shutter is pressed, that's when the mirror pops up.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:26,600
Otherwise the eye can see through this pentaprism, where what is the scene here.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,250
So, in essence, what happens, is, when somebody presses the shutter,

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,330
this op this mirror moves up, the shutter opens, and the light hits the sensor.

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:40,300
So, specifically now, we are going to start looking at is, what is this sensor?

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,360
And what constitutes a sensor like this?
