1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,930
Okay now we want to connect up our
button the way we did for the label.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,640
First let's make a little room for the
button by moving this label up a bit.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,039
And we'll need to open up our utilities
pane so we can drag in the button.

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,990
There we go while we have this
utilities pain on the right open

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,770
let's go ahead and
set the titles on this button and label.

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,910
To do that you're going to want to
go to the attributes inspector and

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,460
then you can see here's
where our Title gets set.

8
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,670
We'll just say Click.

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,450
And then for the label let's just
set its original text to zero.

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:43,440
Let's close our Utilities pane for
now and move this back to the center.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,730
And next up we're going to set
the target action on this button.

12
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,380
First up, let's open up our
View Controller file for

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,960
a little review on target actions.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,060
Recall that the target action
that we added programmatically

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,760
had three key components.

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,890
Its target which was self, the action
which was the method increment count,

17
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,280
and the event that would trigger
that action touch up inside.

18
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,240
So now we're going to use
storyboard to tie together these

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,920
same three pieces of information.

20
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,140
But first, we need to mark this method
as a IB action, so that it actually

21
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,760
shows up in storyboard, similar to
how we did with the label property.

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,690
And we can close our assistant editor
for now and focus on story board.

23
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,430
And then move this over a bit.

24
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,280
And to set our target action,
first we bring up the buttons

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,680
pop up connections menu,
go down to touch up inside,

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,010
drag to our View Controller, and choose
the method we want to be our action.

27
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,730
I'm just going to remove that
target action really quick so

28
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,570
I can show you how to
make it one other way.

29
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,210
Using the canvass view you can still
get to this menu, go from touch up

30
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:58,480
inside to the view controller and
then the method increment count and

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,230
you can see the three key
components of the target action.

32
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,650
Let's go ahead and run it so
we can see it in action and

33
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,479
if we click on the button we
can see our count incrementing.

34
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,240
So that ought to take
care of click counter.
