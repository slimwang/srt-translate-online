00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,990
In my final question, I look at the exact same network

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,710
as before, but I would like to know the minimum number of

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,880
numerical parameters, such as the values

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,010
to define probabilities and conditional probabilities,

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,120
that are necessary to specify the joint distribution of all five variables.
