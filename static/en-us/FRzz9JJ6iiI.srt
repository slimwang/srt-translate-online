1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,220
Let's take a look at the first step of customer discovery.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,320
You're going to be living this for the next couple of weeks

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,950
if you're doing this for real.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,260
Phase 1 is you state your hypotheses and you draw the business model canvas.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,490
And again, you put the canvas on the wall, you and your team get around

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,590
and put up yellow stickies.

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,930
But the next step is you get out of the building.

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,670
You're going to test the problem.

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,320
You're going to test your understanding of the customer's problem or need,

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,290
and you're going to figure out how to build the prototype.

11
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,550
The next thing is you're going to test the solution,

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,710
and you're going to test the solution if you're on the Web

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,050
by building a low fidelity and then a high fidelity prototype,

14
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,750
and you're going to again test your understanding of the customers' needs

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,080
and whether your solution matches this.

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,530
And this match, again, is called product market fit.

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,630
That's the holy grail for entrepreneurs.

18
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,500
Am I building something that people can't get enough of

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,150
or are just willing to open up their wallets and empty it in front of you to get their hands on?

20
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:00,230
And the fourth phase in customer discovery is you verify your pivot.

21
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,209
Do people agree that you're solving a high value problem or need,

22
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:07,840
and do you understand your business model enough to start test selling,

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,820
which is the next step in customer validation.

24
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,560
Now, what's really depressing to most entrepreneurs

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,300
is the answer most often the first time you go through this is, "Heck no."

26
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,390
And what's worse is, "Well, they kind of, sort of like..."

27
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,200
Well, kind of, sort of is not a startup.

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,400
Kind of, sort of is people have been nice to you.

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,650
The only time you know that you have something that's worth investing your time

30
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,370
and money in is if people are literally trying to force their money on you

31
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:42,110
or can't use your product even in its buggy, uninitialized form enough.

32
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,780
This is what you're looking for.

33
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,280
And if you haven't found it yet, that's why the customer development process

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,190
is an iterative circle.

35
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,300
It assumes you will be going through this multiple times.

36
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:59,550
And when you finally, finally think you do have something that matches customer needs,

37
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,550
you get to the next step, which is customer validation.
