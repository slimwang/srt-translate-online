1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,885
So in terms that are a streaming pipeline,.

2
00:00:01,885 --> 00:00:02,791
>> Mm-hm.

3
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:04,418
>> Do you guys leverage Trident at all?

4
00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:07,020
>> So, Trident we were using originally.

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,420
>> Okay. >> But then there, due to some production issues and

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,149
and we decided to kind of phase it out.

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:16,874
>> Right.

8
00:00:16,874 --> 00:00:22,032
>> The main reason is like he targeted some kind of issues in terms of

9
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:24,538
how often we can sustain the right,

10
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:29,303
especially because is a [INAUDIBLE] system, not a tuple-oriented system.

11
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:30,290
>> Yeah-

12
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,590
>> So on that writing of those tuples inside,

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,570
any of those batches are leading had some constraint.

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,360
And then we also found out, like more than 98 [INAUDIBLE] jobs

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,240
are using regular Storm as compared to Trident.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,950
>> Right. >> Then when we look at use cases for Trident when we went deeper and

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,800
they, they no need to do exactly once.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,020
>> Right. >> So it so but thing of merging these [INAUDIBLE] doing multiple,

19
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,050
maintaining those systems means, that we decide to do only one system.

20
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,294
So that kind of converged everything went to strong [INAUDIBLE]
