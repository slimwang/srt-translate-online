00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,340
Now that we have illustrated hierarchical planning, what does it tell us about

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,890
intelligence? Intelligent agents, both cognitive and artificial, constantly

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,570
faced with large, complex problems. The problem spaces corresponding to these

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,830
problems often have [INAUDIBLE] explosion of states in them. Intelligent agents

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,140
address these complex problems by thinking at multiple levels of abstraction. So

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,940
that at any one level of abstraction, the problem appears small and

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,950
simple. In order to be able to reason at these multiple levels of abstraction,

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,270
we need knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction. In this case,

9
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,260
there was knowledge not only at the level of move operations, but

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,040
also the level of macro operations, like unstack and

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,160
stack ascending. And perhaps even higher level macro operations, like sort.

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,780
This goes back to the fundamental notion of knowledge based AI. Intelligent

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,730
agents use knowledge in order to be able to tackle hard, complex problems.
