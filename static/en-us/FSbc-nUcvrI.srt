1
00:00:00,165 --> 00:00:03,628
Do you ever feel like leaving you
problems behind, strapping on your arm

2
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:06,692
cannon and going on an adventure
to jump around on top of stuff and

3
00:00:06,692 --> 00:00:08,021
blast away at evil robots?

4
00:00:08,021 --> 00:00:09,195
I know, right?

5
00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:10,054
Me too.

6
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:13,709
Welcome to our second course on
2D game development with Lib GDX.

7
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:17,029
In the first course, we made
a simple game of dodging icicles.

8
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:21,240
In this course, we'll learn how to
make a much more complex platformer

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,426
game featuring our hero, Giga Gal.

10
00:00:23,426 --> 00:00:27,345
In the first three levels, you'll let
Giga Gal walk around, including this

11
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:31,158
cool walk animation, and you'll let
her jump around on top of platforms.

12
00:00:31,158 --> 00:00:34,441
Giga Gal will jump around on
the top of platforms, dodging and

13
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:37,613
fighting enemies with bullets
fired out of her arm cannon.

14
00:00:37,613 --> 00:00:39,191
Sounds pretty cool, huh?

15
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:42,558
So what do we need to do
to bring Giga Gal to life?

16
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:44,834
This course has eight levels to beat.

17
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:47,778
In this level,
you'll learn how to draw the images and

18
00:00:47,778 --> 00:00:50,151
animations that make
up Giga Gal's world.

19
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:54,631
In the next levels, we'll add the logic
for Giga Gal herself, the platforms, and

20
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:57,650
the camera that follows
Giga Gal around the game world.

21
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,960
In the second half of the course,
we will add the evil robot enemies, and

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,372
let Giga Gal fight back with her cannon.

23
00:01:04,372 --> 00:01:08,254
Finally, we will learn to load
level data, and add a HUD and

24
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:09,816
on-screen controls.

25
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:13,521
By the way, this course relies heavily
on the content from our first course on

26
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:16,600
2D game development with Lib GDX,
so if you haven't already,

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,640
you'll definitely want to take
that course before moving on.
