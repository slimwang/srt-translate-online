1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,540
So the five steps in making a panorama are capture images, detecting and

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:10,120
matching the features amongst images, warping the images to align the features,

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,390
blending, fading or cutting to get the right pixels, and

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,110
merging all of those images together and then, of course, cropping.

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,230
This allows me to generate a panorama like this one.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,950
Again, each and every aspect of this we will cover in detail.

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,590
The reason for this example here is to showcase this whole pipeline and

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,850
how it relates to the computation of photography pipeline.

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,670
So then we can come back and refer to it as we develop the techniques later.
