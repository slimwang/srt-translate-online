00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,630
If our Y intercept is A, and our slop is B, then we get that Y hat equals A

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:15,000
plus Bx and Bx plus A. This means that when X is zero, the Y value equals B

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,110
times zero plus A. And since anything times zero is just zero, y hat equals a.

4
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,830
The y intercept is always the y value when x is zero
