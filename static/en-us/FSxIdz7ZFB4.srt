00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,140
Congratulations, you successfully
completed your master resume.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,760
You now have an index sheet of all
of your professional experience.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,290
Now, you are ready to begin
crafting a targeted resume.

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,690
In this phase of the lesson,
envision yourself as a cook.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,441
Your master resume is your pantry full
of good ingredients and now you need to

6
00:00:18,441 --> 00:00:22,150
use these items to make a targeted
resume, much like you would a good meal.

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,647
Because even the best ingredients can
still make a bad meal, you want to

8
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:29,743
keep in mind moderation, planning, and
tactfulness in this creative endeavor.

9
00:00:29,743 --> 00:00:33,467
Just like a cook gets to be creative in
what ingredients to use to make a meal,

10
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:37,133
you'll also get to be selective when
you decide on what elements to include

11
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:37,964
in your resume.

12
00:00:37,964 --> 00:00:38,850
Let's get cooking.
