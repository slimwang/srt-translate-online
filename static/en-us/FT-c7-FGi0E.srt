00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,820
Now let's do a quiz on hash function.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,306
Check the statements that are true.

3
00:00:04,306 --> 00:00:08,189
First, the one-way hash
function is important

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,060
not only in message authentication,
but also in digital signatures.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,250
Second, SHA processes the input
one block at a time, but

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,920
each block goes through
the same processing.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,100
Third, HMAC is secure,
provided that the embedded hash function

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,390
has good cryptographic strengths,
such as one-way and collision resistant.
