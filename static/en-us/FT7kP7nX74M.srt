1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,427
So here you can see that constants
have been set up, state_signed_in,

2
00:00:03,427 --> 00:00:07,980
state_signing_in, state_in_progress,
are zero, one, and two respectively.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,860
We also have this integer called
signInProgress that's going to be

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,440
used to track them.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,280
Now let's take a look at what's
in the onConnected method.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,200
So, onConnected is called
when we successfully connect

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,670
to the Google infrastructure,
ie we've actually logged in.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,720
So I'm just going to log
that we're onConnected, and

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,560
because we're logged in, we want to
set the sign in button to be disabled.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,530
So setEnabled false, and
we want the sign out and

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,780
revoke buttons to be true so
that the user can click them.

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,330
Next we just want to set that the sign
in progress is STATE_SIGNED_IN, so

13
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,870
we're indicating
the the process is complete.

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,290
Finally, we're signed in, so
let's do something interesting.

15
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,390
We're just going to get a person
object of the current user using

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,290
the Plus.PeopleApi.getCurrentPerson and
passing it to client.

17
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,800
Once we have this person object we
can then access properties on it,

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,590
such as their display name.

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,500
So when I sign in to the infrastructure,
my actual real name and

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,380
not just my email address
is available to the app.

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,040
And as you saw when I demoed the app
earlier on it would say something like

22
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,210
welcome with my full name, or
Signed In to G+ as with my full name.

23
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,880
And that's how it was able to do it.

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,840
So now we have onConnected
implemented and it's looking good.

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,790
We will next need to take a look
at onConnectionFailed and

26
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,990
at what we manage in that.
