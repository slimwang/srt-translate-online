00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,900
Given two prime numbers, p and q,
we need to compute n, total n, and then

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,720
we need to select a public key, and from
there, we need to compute a private key.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,120
We know that n = p x q.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,782
Therefore, n is 33, and since p and

5
00:00:16,782 --> 00:00:22,740
q are prime numbers,
total n is (p-1) x (q-1).

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,450
Therefore, total n is 2 x 10 = 20.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,189
We selected e public key 7,
which is a prime number.

8
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,710
Obviously, because it is a prime number,
it's relatively prime to total n.

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,250
It will have a multiplicative inverse.

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,520
What is the value of t such that e
times t mark total n is equal to 1?

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,370
Given that e is 7,
it's obvious that t is

12
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,527
3 because 3 x 7 is 21 and
21 minus 20 is 1.

13
00:00:54,527 --> 00:00:56,850
So what's the public key?

14
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,657
The public key is the pair e,n.

15
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:01,740
Therefore, it is 7, 33.

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,614
The private key is d,n.

17
00:01:06,614 --> 00:01:11,277
Therefore it is 3, 33.
