1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,470
Now I can almost hear you at
home thinking okay dudes.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,640
I got it.
Now what?

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,630
>> One of the first things you should
do is to think on your business model.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,480
What is your profit model, and
how are you going to execute against it?

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,440
A few important questions that
could guide you in the right path.

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,920
Would you or someone you know that
represents the target audience

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,180
pay this amount for that service?

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,290
Why?

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,640
Are there any great alternatives
out there that are free?

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,970
What is your expected burn-rate?

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:31,820
How would you control it?

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,630
What is the gross margin?

13
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,740
What are the net margins?

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,590
How many sales do you need to
make in order to break even?

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,270
What is the worst case scenario for
your business?

16
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,020
How would you overcome it?

17
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,490
Lots of question, no?

18
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,490
Well, it's just a tool to
put us in the right path.

19
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,950
Even if some of these questions
are not applicable to you right now,

20
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,480
it's a good idea to address
them when you are ready.
