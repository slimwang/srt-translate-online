00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,780
Now, before dug deeper into the more sophisticated algorithms,

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:08,039
I would like to briefly tell you a little about a technique known as brute force.

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,520
So what does brute force mean? Does it mean that we take a hammer

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,220
and beat the answer out of our computer?

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:19,840
Of course not. Brute force is the algorithm that Alice, Bob, and Carol were using initially.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,520
So, you remember, for example, that for Bob,

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,070
we were using an algorithm like this or not using but proposing an algorithm like this at least

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:33,020
that simply went through all possible assignments of zero and one to the vertices,

9
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,670
or at that time, we steal common genes and weakness of this algorithm was that

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,020
it had a pretty unacceptable running time

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,680
as soon as you got to more than 20 or 30 vertices in the network.

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,000
But this algorithm actually also has two strength.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,370
One strength from it is that it's very simple, and the other thing is that,

14
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,130
because it's so simple, you can actually also implement it rather fast.

15
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,800
Under certain conditions, using an algorithm like this,

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,710
actually might not be that bad an idea

17
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,970
in this method of using all possible assignments.

18
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,310
First of all, we're not confused the hammer here.

19
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:08,490
This method if going through all possible assignments without any more sophisticated

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,330
techniques or sophisticated algorithmic techniques is known as brute force.

21
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,820
And so, as I've explained to you, there are certain conditions for brute force is actually desirable.

22
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,430
So, let's have you figure out what those conditions could be,

23
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,700
and by brute force, of course, we try all possibilities.

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,970
Could it be that when you don't have much time to design and program a more sophisticated algorithm.

25
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,440
Could it be when the instances where the inputs for which you're trying to solve your problem are small.

26
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,550
Say n is the size of the problem smaller than 20

27
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,420
or could it be when you need to solve the problem only once

28
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,560
and the input might be a little bit bigger there.

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,880
For each one, I'm going to give you two choices

30
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,170
whether under these conditions using brute force could be okay

31
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,790
and the first one is a maybe and second one is a definitive no.

32
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,070
I'm not going to give you a clear yes choice because,

33
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,030
obviously, since we're dealing with NP complete problems here,

34
00:01:59,030 --> 99:59:59,999
brute force is never generally advisable of course.
