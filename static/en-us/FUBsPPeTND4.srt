00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,311
That was all great work. You now know how to plot points in a Cartesian

2
00:00:03,311 --> 00:00:07,094
coordiante system. You can look at lines and identify x and y intercepts. And

3
00:00:07,094 --> 00:00:10,970
you can calculate intercepts from an equation which is really just a description

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,616
of a line. And in the next section we will investigate lines and equations in

5
00:00:14,616 --> 00:00:18,455
more detail. We'll look at slope and figure out what that word actually means.

6
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:21,970
Try some practice on this, and then stay with me to see what's next.
