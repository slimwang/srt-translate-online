1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,690
When evaluating square roots or other even roots we can't take the root of a

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,676
negative number. That's because there's no number that can multiply two times,

3
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:13,840
or any even number of times, to have a negative sign. We know a negative times

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,545
a negative equals a positive number, so any number of two negative signs would

5
00:00:17,545 --> 00:00:23,750
always be a positive. So we can't exactly simplify the square root of negative

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,824
1. We know it's not equal to negative 1, since negative 1 times negative 1

7
00:00:26,824 --> 00:00:31,690
really equals positive 1. And, we also know that the square root of negative 1

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:36,894
does not equal positive 1 since 1 times 1 equals 1. There's no value in the

9
00:00:36,894 --> 00:00:41,382
real number system that gives us the square root of negative 1. We'll need

10
00:00:41,382 --> 00:00:45,120
something else for this. It turns out that we define it as i, an imaginary

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,625
number. I allows us to take the square root of negative numbers. For example,

12
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:55,350
if I wanted to take the square root of -4, I would split this radical up, into

13
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,200
the square root of -1, and the square root of 4. We know that the square root

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,622
of 4 is simply 2. And the square of negative 1 really equals i our imaginary

15
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:10,110
number. So, we get the products of 2i. for the second one we have the square

16
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,180
root of 3 times the square root of negative 1. This number really represents i.

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,850
So, we replace the square root of negative 1 with i. We leave the product of

18
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,662
the factor in front of the radical. So we'll have I times of the square root of

19
00:01:23,662 --> 00:01:27,376
three, our final result. And for our last one, we'll have the square root of

20
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:31,340
negative one times the square root of 12. We can simplify the square root of 12

21
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,790
by breaking it up into the square root of four times the square root of three.

22
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,161
We know the square root of negative one is really equal to I. So we write that

23
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:43,826
here. And then we take the square root of 4 which is 2. We multiply these two

24
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:48,840
together to get 2i times the square root of 3. In a lot of ways we treat i just

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,117
like a variable. We list it after the product of any numerical factors but

26
00:01:52,117 --> 00:01:56,450
before the radical sign. Now that we've seen a couple of cases of simplifying

27
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,153
negative radicals with i let's see if you have the hang of it.
