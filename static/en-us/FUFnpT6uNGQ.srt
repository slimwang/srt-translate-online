1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,533
Remember, that when we add and subtract complex numbers, the imaginary parts are

2
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:11,842
like terms and the real parts are like terms. So we end up with 1 plus 3i plus

3
00:00:11,842 --> 00:00:19,929
the quanity negative 6 plus 2i equals negative 5 plus 5i. 1 plus 3i minus the

4
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:25,867
quanity negative 6 plus 2i gives us 7 plus i. When we multiply complex numbers,

5
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:30,742
this needs to happen by distributing in the same way that we did with binomials

6
00:00:30,742 --> 00:00:37,034
involving, involving variables. The quantity 1 plus 3i times the quantity

7
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:44,710
negative 6 plus 2i, gives us negative 6, plus 2i, minus 18i, plus 6i squared.

8
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:53,222
Which when simplified, gives us negative 6, minus 16i, minus 6 or negative 12

9
00:00:53,222 --> 00:00:58,604
minus 16i. And lastly, when we divided complex numbers, the final thing we need

10
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:03,068
to do is to make the denominator into a real number, so that we can just let it

11
00:01:03,068 --> 00:01:07,910
modify the coefficients of the real and imaginary parts of the denominator. To

12
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:13,350
change the denominator in this way, we multiply both the denominator and the

13
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,540
numerator by the complex conjugate of the original denominator. So, negative 6

14
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:26,931
minus 2i in this case. Now let's look at the problem. 1 plus 3i, divided by

15
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:33,756
negative 6 plus 2i, gives us 1 plus 3i, times the conjugate negative 6 minus 2i,

16
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:41,371
divided by negative 6 plus 2i, times negative 6 minus 2i. Simplifying further,

17
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:49,989
we got negative 6 minus 2i minus 18i minus 6i squared, divided by 36 minus 4i

18
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:59,378
squared. Which gives us negative six minus 20i plus 6, divided by 36 plus 4 or

19
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:05,843
negative 20i over 40, and finally negative i over 2.
