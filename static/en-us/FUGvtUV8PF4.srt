1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,010
Pete, could you tell me a little bit
about Metrics and how you guys went

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,710
about measuring things in the early days
and what was important in measuring?

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,532
>> That's a really good question because
you're pretty resource-constrained

4
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:15,880
early on and every moment you spend
implementing some fancy analytic

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,470
is one less moment you could be focusing
on your customers or your product.

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,630
But when I look back,

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,010
I think there were a few things that
we tracked that were really helpful.

8
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,777
The first thing, and
they're not all numbers.

9
00:00:29,777 --> 00:00:33,704
The first was Dan, my co-founder, set up
an email that would email everyone in

10
00:00:33,704 --> 00:00:35,288
the company every single day and

11
00:00:35,288 --> 00:00:38,822
say here's the list of everybody that
signed up for our product today.

12
00:00:38,822 --> 00:00:43,140
And I remember being so excited when
I noticed somebody from Starbucks

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,100
had signed up or we noticed this
big company or this big company.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,160
That gave us a simple way
to jump on these moments.

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,830
Email and say, hey what's going on?

16
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,450
Can we help you?

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,790
And I think, some of our longest
lasting customer relationships started

18
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,130
through that, so it was a really easy
way to plug in to what was actually

19
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,099
happening with our customers.

20
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,400
The second one is,
it sounds a little funny actually.

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,750
We made it impossible to fire
Optimizely without sending us an email.

22
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,790
So we didn't built any way to
unsubscribe from our service.

23
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,340
Instead we said, if you want to
unsubscribe, email Optimizely.

24
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,760
And we were a little worried that people
would be really pissed off about this.

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,130
And one or two were, but it also
gave us a really, really clear and

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,310
quick way to understand
where we were screwing up.

27
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,200
I think where otherwise some of
these customers would have sort of

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,150
silently drifted off into the night.

29
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,150
This gave us an avenue to
ask what was going wrong.

30
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,700
What could we have done to have
kept you as a happy customer?

31
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,950
And we didn't earn them all back,

32
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,720
we probably didn't earn
many of them back as first.

33
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,450
But it was a pretty easy way to find
out where we were screwing up and

34
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,020
so, I'd like to think that the most
important metrics early on

35
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,550
were the ones that help us stay in
tune to where we were pleasing and

36
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,780
where we were angering customers.

37
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,400
>> So given where the company is
currently, what do you think is

38
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,440
important to measure in the next
couple months or years.

39
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,117
>> Well, we're a lot bigger now,
we're hundreds of employees and

40
00:02:06,117 --> 00:02:07,492
we have thousands of customers.

41
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:10,633
And we've gotten a lot more
sophisticated in how we

42
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:12,982
measure our financials as a company.

43
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:17,428
So how we forecast gap revenue
analysis and all of that.

44
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,950
And that's been very illuminating.

45
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,270
It's great as a founder to be able to
have that view into your business.

46
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,990
One of things that we're trying to
build out now, I mentioned this before,

47
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,340
is the ability to measure
customers in the same way.

48
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,490
And to give everybody inside Optimizely
this same crystal clear view of how

49
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,610
our customers are doing, and how good
the experience we're giving them is.

50
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,490
And the way we do that is with
the optimized lead promoter system.

51
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,490
I mentioned this before.

52
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,630
It's a variant of NPS
net promoter system.

53
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,180
And we ask our customers
a simple question.

54
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,470
And we ask them to explain,

55
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,730
how likely would they be to recommend
Optimizely to a friend or colleague.

56
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,820
And based on that answer and
based on the reason for

57
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,240
their answer we get insights
into how well we're doing.

58
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,880
It's pretty easy to
spot leading indicators

59
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,000
which we expect will later show
up in the revenue elsewhere.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,140
If we're giving our customers a bad
experience we'd expect to see that in

61
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,830
churn numbers.

62
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,160
>> Hm.
>> But churn is a trailing indicator.

63
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,760
We're doing our best now to
build leading indicators of

64
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,680
how well we're treating our customers,
and that's a big challenge for

65
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,860
us over the next few years.

66
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,560
>> Yeah, it sounds like it.
