00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,689
We could also solve this problem by setting up a proportion. We can compare the

2
00:00:04,702 --> 00:00:09,380
number of dimes and quarters in the ratio to the number of dimes and quarters in

3
00:00:09,392 --> 00:00:14,145
our hand. When we set two ratios equal, we get a proportion. The number of dimes

4
00:00:14,157 --> 00:00:18,650
in our ratio was 2. For our ratio we had 2 to 3, or 2 3rd. And in our hand, we

5
00:00:18,662 --> 00:00:22,785
had 10 dimes, and I didn't know the number of quarters, so I'm going to use a

6
00:00:22,797 --> 00:00:26,990
variable, q. Once the proportion is set up, we can solve for unknown amounts

7
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:31,490
using cross-multiplication. This method comes from multiplying both sides of the

8
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:36,239
equation by the denominators. Notice 3 divided by 3 makes 1, so I'm left with 2

9
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:41,324
q on this side. And q divided by q makes one as well, so I'm left with 3 times

10
00:00:41,336 --> 00:00:46,283
10 or 30 on this side. We could've gotten to this step a lot quicker, if we

11
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:50,938
would have just cross multiplied 3 times 10 is 30, and q times 2 is 2 q, we

12
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,463
would get this equation. We want to be careful when we cross multiply. We can

13
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:59,426
only do it when there's one entire fraction on the left and on the right. If

14
00:00:59,438 --> 00:01:03,571
there's other sums or differences, you should try something else. And then to

15
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:07,642
find the number of quarters, we divide by 2. So, the number of quarters is 15.
