1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,734
So if Miriam really does have a friendly personality. What we mean by that is

2
00:00:04,734 --> 00:00:09,818
that her threshold for acting friendly is lower than most people. So here we

3
00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:15,744
see Miriam's threshold for acting friendly. She's more likely to act friendly

4
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:21,455
in different situations as compared to not acting friendly. On the other hand,

5
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:25,231
we have Biriam, who has a very high threshold for acting friendly, meaning it

6
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:28,830
takes him a lot more to be nice to someone than it would for Miriam to be nice

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:37,554
to someone. So this is one trait that makes Biriam and Miriam unique. So traits

8
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:43,175
change our threshold for behaving. And make us more likely to behave in ways

9
00:00:43,175 --> 00:00:48,585
consistent with with the trait. Such as being friendly. And less likely to

10
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:54,170
behave in ways Inconsistent with the trait, for example, being hostile or mean.

11
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,265
So just because it takes a lot more for Biriam to be friendly, it doesn't mean

12
00:00:58,265 --> 00:01:02,490
that he can't be friendly and just because Miriam is usually friendly doesn't

13
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:09,138
mean there aren't situations where she's not friendly. Their traits make them

14
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:12,435
more likely to behave in a way that's consistent.
