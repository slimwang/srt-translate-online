1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,490
If you think back to lesson five,
you'll recall how large and

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,410
complex the data standards are.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,150
This is an arbitrary,
human anatomy, physiology, and

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,390
diseases are very complex.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,550
To be accurate, and

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,969
electronic record must be able
to capture the nuances of care.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,230
To be maximally useful it would ideally
capture most of this as structured

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,880
coded information.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,260
How do you do that?

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,210
How can you provide busy physicians
with a way to accurately and

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,280
efficiently capture such
a complex data set?

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,700
That's the EHR data capture challenge,
and it has been with us for decades.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,080
The most common approach is this,
a template.

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,790
Essentially an electronic version
of the paper check-off forms

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,440
physicians have used for
years in their practices.
