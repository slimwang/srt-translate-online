1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What I want to do now is look at some of the different kinds of testing that exist,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and so what this really is is a very, very brief survey.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's not intended to be exhaustive, and it's not intended

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
to give you an orthogonal set of kinds of testing because

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
there's going to be a bunch of overlap between these different categories.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What kind of testing you often hear about is white box testing,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and what white box testing refers to is the fact that

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the tester is using detailed knowledge about the internals of the system

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
in order to construct better test cases.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And in the next unit we're going to really look at white box testing in quite a bit of detail.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The complement to white box testing is black box testing,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and black box testing refers to the fact that we're not using

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
detailed knowledge of the system's internals.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We're rather testing the system based on what we know about how

15
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
it's supposed to respond to our test cases.
