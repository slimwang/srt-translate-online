00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,077
The keyID property is going to represent the Ask E value of the key that was

2
00:00:03,077 --> 00:00:06,770
pressed by the user. For this next quiz what we'd like you to do is exercise

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,890
what we've talked about in action. You need to create an element array of 256

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,670
named keyState, whenever the user presses or releases a key you should mark

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,025
that state in that array. To do this, make sure you utilize the code that we've

6
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:22,822
already written. For capturing and hooking up the listeners for KeyDown and

7
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:27,060
KeyUp. Finally, inside of the update function, make sure that you're querying

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,415
the keyState to determine whether or not you should or should not drop the

9
00:00:30,415 --> 00:00:33,129
beat, in proper fashion.
