1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,036
Now the mean is calculated as before

2
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:06,139
independently for each of the 2 features here.

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,909
Three, 4, 5, 6, 7, the mean is 5.

4
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:12,045
Eight, 7, 5, 3, 2, the mean is 5 again.

5
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,954
Easy calculation. If you subtract the mean

6
00:00:14,954 --> 00:00:19,064
from the data we get the following matrix

7
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:21,154
and now we just have to plug it in.

8
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:24,758
For the main diagonal elements you get the same formula as before.

9
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,828
You can do this separately for each of the 2 columns.

10
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,564
But for the off-diagonal elements you just have to plug it in.

11
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,466
So this is the result after plugging it in

12
00:00:32,466 --> 99:59:59,999
and you might just want to verify it using a computer.
