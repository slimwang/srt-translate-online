00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The easiest way to ignore outliers is called quartiles or their closely related cousin, percentiles.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Suppose we have a data set the following form and here

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the data is shown in order--there's exactly 11 items.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Then quartiles partition this data into four regions and look carefully, there's gaps in between.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The element in the center that you've encountered--you might remember

6
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
what is the mean, median, or the mode--please check one of those.
