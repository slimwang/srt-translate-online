00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,734
Now are there many types of effect size measures? I can think of at least six

2
00:00:03,734 --> 00:00:08,712
or seven right now. But most of them fall under two main groups. Two families,

3
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:12,790
if you will. The first we call difference measures. The easiest difference

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,488
measure is one we've already talked about, the mean difference. The next type

5
00:00:16,488 --> 00:00:20,204
are called standardized differences. And there are several different types of

6
00:00:20,204 --> 00:00:23,710
standardized differences measures. But we'll focus on one, and that measure's

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,206
called Cohen's d. This is the standardized difference measure we're going to

8
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:30,969
use throughout the rest of this course. Notice that Cohen's d as a standardized

9
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:35,339
difference measure actually tells us about the mean difference. It does so in

10
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:39,378
standard deviation units. The next family are called correlation measures.

11
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:42,778
There are again, several different correlation measures, as with standardized

12
00:00:42,778 --> 00:00:47,722
mean differences. We're going to focus on one, which is called r squared. R

13
00:00:47,722 --> 00:00:53,948
squared tells us to proportion or percentage a variation in one variable. In

14
00:00:53,948 --> 00:00:57,783
other words, change in one variable, that is related to another variable, and

15
00:00:57,783 --> 00:01:02,978
sometimes, we say instead of related to, we say explained by. What we mean,

16
00:01:02,978 --> 00:01:06,698
explained by, is that we can explain a certain percentage or proportion of

17
00:01:06,698 --> 00:01:12,420
variation or change in one variable by knowing the value of the other variable.
