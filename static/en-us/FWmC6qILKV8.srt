00:00:00,495 --> 00:00:03,690
Explanation based learning is a very common classroom task, you and

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,080
I appear to do it all the time. We can use a chair to prop open a door, and

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,380
we can deliver a very quick explanation for why the chair is a good prop.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,180
We can use a coffee mug to hold down a pile of papers, and

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,980
pull out an explanation for why the coffee mug would make a good paper weight.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,630
Of course there is a lot more to it than we have discussed sso far.

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,630
Explanation based learning is central [INAUDIBLE] on cognitive science, because

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,870
we are trying to build human like, human level intelligence. Explanations and

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,090
explanation based learning nowhere is prominent in other schools of AI.

10
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,700
Second, note that humans are not very good at explaining everything.

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,020
We can only explain those things which appear to be consciously accessible.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,880
We have a hard time explaining memory processes, for

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,830
example, or we have a hard time explaining certain kinds of physical actions.

14
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,340
For example, when I play tennis, my feet move the way they do, and

15
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,460
I can't explain to you why I can't make them move better. Third, although we

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,860
can generate explanations, this does not necessarily mean that our process for

17
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,080
generating explanation is the same process that we use to arrive at the decision

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,325
in the first place. Explanations can be post talk. Further, the very act

19
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:17,685
of [UNKNOWN] explanations could interfere with the reasoning process.

20
00:01:17,685 --> 00:01:19,010
[BLANK_AUDIO]

21
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,375
However, when we can generate explanations, it can lead to much deeper,

22
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,871
much richer understanding and learning,

23
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:30,317
because it exposes the cause of connections. Finally, for AI systems to be

24
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:34,919
accepted in our society they must be able to generate good explanations. You,

25
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:38,311
for example, will be unlikely to accept the advice of a medical

26
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:42,413
diagnostic system if the diagnostic system cannot explain it's answers.

27
00:01:42,413 --> 00:01:46,731
I must be able to explain it's answers as well as the process it used to

28
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:50,880
arrive at those answers. Explanation is fundamental to trust.
