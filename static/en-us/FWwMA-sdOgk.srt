1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,980
When we said that the framework didn't want us

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,080
to run network operations on the main thread, what

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,630
is the main thread? Well, Android apps run by

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,570
default on the main thread, also called the UI thread.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,900
It handles all the user input as well as

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,060
the output, such as screen drawing. Thus we want

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,760
to avoid any time-consuming operations here, otherwise the URI

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,470
is going to stutter. Instead, kick off a background worker

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,430
thread if you have to do some long-running

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,170
work. This includes doing network calls, decoding bitmaps, or

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,870
reading, and writing from the database. Okay. So, somehow,

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,890
we have to move the networking code off the

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,800
main thread. But how are we going to do

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,180
that? Well there are several options, but let's look

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,610
for the name of the Android class that simplifies

16
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,520
background thread creation and UI thread synchronization, so that

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,370
the results from the background work will come back onto the

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,710
main thread, and then we can use it to update our

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,740
UI. Search online and figure out the answer to this question

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,740
and then enter the class name in the box. Here's some

21
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,950
advice for you. If you ever get stuck on how to

22
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,480
do something in Android and you can't find it on the

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,220
developer's site you can try to check stackoverflow.com. It's a question

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,740
and answer site that many Android developers use as a valuable resource.

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,700
So chances are likely that someone has

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,850
already asked a similar question that you have.
