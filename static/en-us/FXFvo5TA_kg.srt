1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,350
That's still pretty ugly.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,160
We can make that look even nicer.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:03,960
All right?

4
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,360
Here is a very simple, beautiful way of writing this.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,650
That this quadratic approximation, so

6
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,090
quadratic, remember we're just looking at the square terms of the u v.

7
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,640
Right? It can be written matrix form as u v times this matrix M times u v.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,600
This, you know, you could think of this as u v, transpose.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,290
All right, where M is the second moment matrix written down here, okay?

10
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,920
Again, what is has is it's the weighted sum of the squares and

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,740
of the product of the two different derivatives.

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,320
It pays to think a little bit more about this M matrix,

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,140
because we're going to do it even more in a minute, all right?

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,770
So, here I've just copied it over, and for a moment, it's kind of a joke.

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,130
For you guys that're physics geeks, if I say for the moment and

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,950
we're talking about the second order matrix,

17
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,780
you realize it has something to do with moments of inertia.

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,570
Nevermind.

19
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:01,070
Okay, I'm going to write that M matrix in, without the weights at the bottom.

20
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:01,980
Okay.

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,890
And when I write it that way,

22
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,110
you can see that this is just the sum of ixx, sum of iyy, and the cross sum.

23
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,520
That can just be written as the sum,

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,660
this is referred to as an outer product, right?

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,080
So it's the outer product of the single gradient, okay.

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,979
That's what this says.

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,100
One of these is just the outer product of one vector.

28
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,510
It's a two by two matrix but it's an outer product of one vector.

29
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:33,690
In linear algebra you realize that's only a rank one matrix, right.

30
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:39,463
Because let's just take the columns, the columns are just a multiple of Ix Iy.

31
00:01:39,463 --> 00:01:44,780
And each column is, is a, is a, is a multiple, multiplied by a different scaler.

32
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,310
So when the two columns are scaler multiples of each other,

33
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,590
it's not a full rank matrix.

34
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,785
So its two by two is actually rank one.

35
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:56,470
Okay, that's what it says here, each is a product of rank one.

36
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,340
And then of course,

37
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,540
this thing is going to be summed over all of the points within the window.

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,640
So what's it going to take for this matrix to be full rank, for

39
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,538
this to be sort of a well-behaved ellipse?

40
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:13,200
We would actually have to have gradients in different directions over

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,830
the window to be summing up a bunch of different rank one matrices and

42
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,100
that would get us to a full rank.
