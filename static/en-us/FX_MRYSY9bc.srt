00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,415
Let's do another performance comparison quiz. Let's say

2
00:00:03,415 --> 00:00:05,395
now we have the new laptop that can compress

3
00:00:05,395 --> 00:00:07,380
this video in ten minutes. But we drop

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,940
this laptop, and it falls down the storm drain.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,840
So we have to use the old laptop that took four hours to do this. So what

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,120
is the speedup of using the old laptop instead

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,140
of the new one that fell down the drain?
