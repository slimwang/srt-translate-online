1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,270
So NAT is not a super great solution
to the shortage of addresses in IPv4.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,410
It's a workaround.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,520
But the real solution
has already been built.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,409
And the world is kind of in
the middle of deploying it.

5
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:14,141
That solution is IPv6.

6
00:00:14,141 --> 00:00:17,760
IPv6 is the successor to IPv4.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,395
We're going from 4 directly to 6 because
protocol version 5 was an experiment

8
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:23,766
that didn't work out.

9
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:29,404
IPv6 fixes the address shortage problem
by having much longer addresses,

10
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,549
128 bits or 16 octets long.

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,180
That's 4 times as long
as an IPv4 address.

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,050
2 to the 128th power is really
a colossally huge number of addresses.

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,730
Billions and billions of times
bigger than the v4 address space.

14
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,820
In fact, the smallest block of addresses
that can be assigned to an end user.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,060
Like a home in v6,

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:55,420
is a /64 network which is much larger
than the whole v4 address space.

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,680
But that means that IPv6
addresses are kind of long.

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,190
Like for instance here's
one of Google's addresses.

19
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,853
Now fortunately, the conventional
way of writing these 6 addresses,

20
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:09,781
lets a skip writing these zeros here.

21
00:01:12,735 --> 00:01:15,800
Okay, that's better, a little.

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,230
Anyway, you might notice that these
don't look much like the four addresses.

23
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,810
They're written in hex digits
instead of in decimal.

24
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,100
In blocks of 2 bytes separated
by colons instead of dots.

25
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,620
But remember this is just
the human readable format.

26
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,360
The network actually sends these
addresses as strings of 128 bits.

27
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,442
Just like v4,
we designate the size of a network block

28
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:38,393
with a decimal number of
bits in the network prefix.

29
00:01:38,393 --> 00:01:43,970
Google has all of 2607.f8b0/32.

30
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,490
And many other V6 locks as well.

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,100
Remember on IPv4,
a /32 means a single address.

32
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,100
Whereas on IPv6, it's a large
network with 96 bits of subnet and

33
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,500
host address in it.

34
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,546
So the world doesn't need nat with V6.

35
00:01:58,546 --> 00:02:02,500
There's enough addresses for every
device to get a unique public address.

36
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,370
And IPv6 adoption started out very
slow but it's been growing strong for

37
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,630
several years.

38
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,383
Between mid 2012 and the end of 2015,

39
00:02:10,383 --> 00:02:14,762
Google's measurement of V6 traffic
they received increased from about

40
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:18,377
half a percent of all traffic
to about 10% of all traffic.

41
00:02:18,377 --> 00:02:21,121
And it's higher on weekends
because more home and

42
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:24,140
mobile users have V6 than business and
office users.
