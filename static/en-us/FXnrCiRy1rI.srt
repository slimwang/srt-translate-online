00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,556
The answer is 5 to the 12th. Great job if you got it. For 5 to the 8th, we would

2
00:00:05,556 --> 00:00:10,226
write a 5, 8 times. And then we're going to write a 5, 4 times. Here are 8 5's.

3
00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:14,511
And here are 4 5's. I have them multiplied all together, so I could use an

4
00:00:14,511 --> 00:00:19,261
exponent to represent this repeated multiplication. I have 5 to the 12th.
