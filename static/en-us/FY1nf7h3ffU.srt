1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The first part of the subset question asks about planar graphs and trees.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The first thing to note is that not all planar graphs are trees.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
For example, here's a ring, which is a planar graph and it's not a tree.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And so planar graphs are not a subset of trees. On the other hand, all trees are planar graphs.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
For most trees, it's fairly intuitive to see how it can be drawn in the plane.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
For example, this one is already planar.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But for other trees, it might not be so obvious that we can rearrange everything

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to lay it outside in the plane, and so it'd be nice to have a proof that all trees are planar

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
instead of relying just on intuition.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
One way to prove this is to show that any tree can be drawn inside of a triangle.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And then larger trees can be constructed by combining these triangles.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
More formally, what we want to show is that any tree can be drawn in a plane inside a triangle

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
with any given node at the apex of the triangle.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And so for the base case of one node, we can draw the node at the apex of the triangle

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and this is trivially in a plane.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And so, our inductive step is to assume that the claim is true for all graphs with less than n nodes.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And we want to show that the claim is true for all graphs with n nodes.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So we'll start with a tree with n nodes. We use this for example.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We're going to pick any node kind of at random and we'll call it r.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
For example, one of this node be r. And then we remove r.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Because our original graph was a tree, this separates the graph into separate disjoint trees.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And now since each of these trees have less than n nodes,

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
we can draw each one inside of a triangle.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
First, we can take this tree of four nodes and draw it inside of the triangle.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Notice that the node that was connected to r is at the apex of the triangle.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And then we could do the same for the other two trees.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And then in our last step, we'll make a bigger triangle and we put r at the apex

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and then connect it to the apexes of the other triangles.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This verifies our claim and shows that all tree graphs are planar.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
They are definitely neither due to the definition of trees.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
A tree can have no cycles and a ring must have a cycle.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The answer is neither. >>Yeah. >>Cool.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I never got a really specific definition of a chain besides just the example which was enough but--

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah, same idea kind of a chain doesn't have a cycle whereas a ring does.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And the other thing we got definitely was that the edges in the chain is the number of nodes minus 1

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and the edges in the ring is equal to the nodes.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Therefore, there can be no crossover between them. They're mutually exclusive.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
All chains are trees but not all trees are chains and so its the first one.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It satisfies the definition of a tree graph that it's connected but there are no cycles,

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and then the other description of a tree graph that every pair of nodes in the graphs

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
has a unique path between them.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I mean a chain does that also.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This is definitely one that answer intuitively by looking at the examples.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It gives me 100% confidence in making that claim.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah and just kind of a quick example of--that's a tree and that is not a chain so--

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Correct. And the way I convinced myself of that is drawing an example of a hypercube

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
that was not a ring and a ring that was not a hypercube.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Unless you have a ring that is anything but four nodes it's not a hypercube.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay. >>And any hypercube that's anything but four nodes is definitely not a ring.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Great. So yeah I'll draw one for you and it's just a normal cube.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Right. >>And our second to the last problem is just grids and chains.

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
All chains are grids but not all grids are chains so it's the--chains are the opposite of grids.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah. >>Any chain within nodes is a 1xn grid.

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Once you get a grid that has more than one in either of the two directions, it's no longer a chain.

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And no matter how long you make a chain-- >>Yeah. So this is--

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You can add a node to the chain--a node of n to the chain, that makes it not a grid.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Kind of the first thing you said we have like a 1xn grid and it's also a chain but yeah.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah. This is for example not a chain. >>Correct. >>Cool.
