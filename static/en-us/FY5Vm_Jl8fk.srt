00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,960
Let's summarize quickly on our question:
how long should a timeslice be?

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,595
CPU bound tasks prefer
longer timeslices.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,200
The longer the timeslice,

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,230
the fewer context switches we'll have
to perform, so that basically limits

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,820
the context switching overheads
that the scheduling will introduce.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,300
To perform useful work,

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,740
the useful application processing
to as slow as possible.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,130
And as a result,
both the CPU utilization,

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,130
as well as the system throughput as
metrics will be as high as possible.

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,708
On the other hand, I/O bound
tasks prefer shorter timeslices.

11
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:39,650
This allows I/O bound tasks to issue
I/O operations as soon as possible.

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,100
And as a result, we achieve both
higher CPU and device utilization,

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,130
as well as the performance that the user
perceives that the use, the system is

14
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,340
responsive and that it responds to
its commands and displace output.
