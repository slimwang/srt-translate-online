00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,760
Why don't we try an example using this rational zero theorem? Let's say we have

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,983
this function. f of x equals 4 x squared minus 4 x plus 1. Now, I know that,

3
00:00:09,983 --> 00:00:14,468
based on the rational zero theorem, any rational zero of this polynomial must

4
00:00:14,468 --> 00:00:20,434
be a factor of 1 divided by a factor of 4. Since 1 is the constant term in the

5
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:25,998
expression, and 4 is the leading coefficient. Well, 1 has factors of just 1 and

6
00:00:25,998 --> 00:00:32,453
negative 1. And four has factors of 1 and 4, and also their negatives. And also

7
00:00:32,453 --> 00:00:36,784
2 and negative 2. Can you tell me then, what the possible ratios of factors of

8
00:00:36,784 --> 00:00:41,212
1, or of factors of 4 are? These are the possible rational zeros that the

9
00:00:41,212 --> 00:00:45,436
rational zero theorem says that this function can have. I'll give you one more

10
00:00:45,436 --> 00:00:49,435
hint. There are six different fractions that we should get. As always, please

11
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:51,353
separate these answers by commas.
