00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,552
Now I know that this last method that we used might have felt a little bit

2
00:00:03,552 --> 00:00:07,512
tedious, and it definitely is a fair amount of work, but for certain equations,

3
00:00:07,512 --> 00:00:11,443
it's not too bad to work with. I think that it also really underscores exactly

4
00:00:11,443 --> 00:00:15,327
how you get from the original expression you have to the factored form. It also

5
00:00:15,327 --> 00:00:19,213
really highlights the connection between the different terms in each factor in

6
00:00:19,213 --> 00:00:23,654
the factored form. And how they connect back to the original expression. So even

7
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:27,622
if you always factor by grouping from here on out this still a good experience

8
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:31,398
to have had. It's your choice and frankly both methods do use some similar

9
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:35,322
reasoning. You're still thinking about what numbers add to equal the middle

10
00:00:35,322 --> 00:00:39,498
coefficient, and multiply it to equal the product of the two outer coefficients.
