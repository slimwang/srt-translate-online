00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,200
So let's take a quick look at the code query for the conference entities. So

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,910
here I am in the conference api.javafile or conferenceapifile

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:15,222
and the queryConferences method. So you'll notice it's declared has a at

4
00:00:15,222 --> 00:00:20,750
APIMethod annotation. Name queryConferences. Path queryConferences.

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:26,170
And the httpMethod is HttpMethod.POST. So

6
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,380
the query for the conference is, you create the

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:34,450
query of type conference. Then you call ofy.load.type specifying the

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,570
entity class, which in this case is conference class.

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,150
And then we want to order by name. To actually

10
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,750
execute the query, we call the list method on

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,440
the query. And we're going to return the results of running

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,130
the query, which is going to be all the conferences,

13
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,760
ordered by name. And that's all there is to it.
