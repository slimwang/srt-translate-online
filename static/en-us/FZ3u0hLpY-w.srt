00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,839
So what's the big picture here?

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,689
I'll highlight 2 lessons here from this discussion.

3
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:08,009
The first is the importance of keeping all your threads busy.

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:12,048
Fine grain load imbalance is a performance killer because your thread hardware is sitting idle.

5
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:14,646
Choosing algorithms that reduce imbalance is crucial.

6
00:00:14,646 --> 00:00:17,387
Second, managing communication is equally important.

7
00:00:17,387 --> 00:00:21,126
Communicating through registers is faster than communicating through shared memory,

8
00:00:21,126 --> 00:00:26,565
as we see here, which is in turn faster than communicating with the host.
