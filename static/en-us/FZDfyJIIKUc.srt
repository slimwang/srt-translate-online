1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,280
So let's now compute this homography for the, the Great Wall of China.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,510
Actually Steve did this a really long time ago,

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,490
but I'm going to pretend that we're doing it right now.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,830
So in order to compute homography, the first thing we need,

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,160
is we need sets of corresponding points all right?

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,027
So on the left, we have the original points, x1, y1, x2, y2,

7
00:00:18,027 --> 00:00:19,310
all the way up to xN yN.

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,846
We have a bunch of points, and

9
00:00:20,846 --> 00:00:24,419
on the right, we have the corresponding points in the second image.

10
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:26,756
X1 prime, Y1 prime, X2, and for

11
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:31,585
now, we're going to assume that these points have been found by that tried and

12
00:00:31,585 --> 00:00:35,250
true method of paying somebody else to click on them.

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,020
That's called Amazon Mechanical Turk or something where, or

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,710
maybe you're an undergraduate, and your advisor's beating you up, and

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,670
so you have to do all the clicking, or maybe you're doing this for

16
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,420
a problem set for a computer vision class and you have to do the clicking.

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,370
But basically is somehow you've identified corresponding points between

18
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,880
the two images.

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,110
So, what we have to do now, is we have to solve for this equation, right?

20
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,990
We know that the relationship between p and p prime is going to

21
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:05,379
be this homogeneous coordinate, transform, or homogenous, homography H.

22
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,300
So how do we solve for H given some number of points?

23
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,970
Well, there are two ways.

24
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,870
The first way is the non-homogeneous.

25
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,010
Boo, hiss, all right.

26
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,250
Going back here, even though there are nine variables in the,

27
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,410
in the, matrix, we know there are only eight degrees of

28
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,530
freedom because it's only known up to a scale value.

29
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,090
So we can set, for example, the last entry to one, all right?

30
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,270
Well then, we can set up a linear set of equations, Equals b, where,

31
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:43,040
the vector now is of h where it's going to be a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h.

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,540
But this h isn't the same as that h.

33
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,790
This is the h that's all the elements of the big matrix h,

34
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,740
and this is dumb little h.

35
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,380
Okay, so we got a through f, pretty smart, and dumb little h,

36
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,080
and then g is in there somewhere.

37
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,590
You, you get it.

38
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,190
There's eight unknowns.

39
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,280
Okay, if I knew the first eight letters of the Greek alphabet I

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,660
would have made them that way.

41
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,710
But basically, I've got eight unknowns.

42
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,680
As long as I have four points, I would have eight equations, why?

43
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,669
Because I get an equation for

44
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:14,790
the X, an equation for the Y for each point, corresponding point.

45
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:20,300
But I really because my location, locating of the points won't be precise.

46
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,320
I would be better if I had a whole bunch more points then I would do a least

47
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,550
square solution.

48
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:30,330
And you would solve for the minimum of the magnitude of Minus b squared,

49
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,840
the minimum of that square using least-squares, and

50
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,730
you've known how to do that since eighth grade, I hope, ninth grade,

51
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,410
twelfth grade, I don't, somewhere along the way.

52
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,160
If you don't know what I'm talking about [LAUGH],

53
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,210
go learn a lot of linear algebra before we take the rest of this class.

54
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,370
All right, but this is the non-homogeneous way.

55
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,040
Thinking about this set of equations we've already seen this, right?

56
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,060
Remember when we were doing the extrinsics and we had a whole bunch of

57
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:04,320
equations, two N of them, and we had am equals 0, because we didn't change it.

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,630
So we can do just like we did before.

59
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,288
You multiply this through.

60
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,470
You divide out by the,

61
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:14,080
by w, and you'll get two homogeneous equations for each point, right?

62
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,460
Now instead of m, we're solving for h,

63
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,860
and we have a whole bunch of terms all linear in terms of h, and it equals 0.

64
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,710
And we have 2n of those equations where n is the number of points.

65
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,190
And how do we solve this?

66
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,070
Well you use that singular value decomposition just like we did last time.

67
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,450
Or you could take that a transpose a matrix, solve for the eigenvectors.

68
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,180
Pull out the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue and that was our solution.

69
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,170
Remember we showed that it was the same thing.

70
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,630
That's the way for solving for the homography coefficients.

71
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,780
And by the way, that's the cool way, because you can impress people.

72
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,950
because you can tell them to use singular value decomposition, which has so

73
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,170
many syllables in it, they're sure you're really smart.
