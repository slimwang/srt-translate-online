00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,235
The problem is that we don't want to stop when the balance is exactly equal to

2
00:00:03,235 --> 00:00:07,811
the target. We want to stop as soon as the balance hits the target. So if the

3
00:00:07,811 --> 00:00:11,818
balance is less than the target, we keep growing. And if the balance equals the

4
00:00:11,818 --> 00:00:13,590
target or is more, we stop.
