00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,620
It's great that Firebase
authentication gives us a way to keep

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,710
all of our user
authentication in one place.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,330
It provides multiple ways for
users to sign in such as with password

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:15,437
authentication, Google Sign-In,
Facebook Login, Twitter, and GitHub.

5
00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:19,390
Adding sign-in to your app
sounds pretty basic, but

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,640
it actually takes a lot of work to not
only get the user experience right, but

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,570
also to keep your user
credentials safe and secure.

8
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,730
Firebase authentication saves you from
all the headache, as we shall see.

9
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,209
Firebase gives you the flexibility to
choose your own authentication scheme,

10
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,390
whether that's with email and
passwords, Google, Facebook, or others.

11
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,619
But you would still have to implement
that authentication scheme for

12
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:49,250
each provider as well as create
user facing screens for signing in.

13
00:00:50,604 --> 00:00:53,219
There's a better way though that
saves you development time,

14
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,810
which is just what we need this weekend.

15
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:56,879
It's called FirebaseUI.

16
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,990
FirebaseUI is an opensource library
created by the Firebase team.

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,659
It handles the UI flow for
authenticating with Firebase.

18
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,959
Implementing the best practices for
sign-in and

19
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:11,859
following the brand guidelines for
each of the providers.

20
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:14,959
It also allows us to easily enable and

21
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,049
disable providers literally
by changing one line of code.

22
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,730
At the time of this recording,

23
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,460
FirebaseUI supports passport
authentication, Google sign in and

24
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,799
Facebook log in,
which is just fine for friendly chat.

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,299
Using FirebaseUI allows you
to focus more in the features

26
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:33,409
that make our apps special.
