1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,540
So the best way to find out about anything is to Google it. So I typed in Python

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,310
keyword from. Here I scanned all of the results

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,440
that were available, and then from there I landed

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,070
on this web page. By the way the link to this web site is also available in the

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,130
instructor notes. Now this webpage says that Python's from

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,770
statement lets you import specific attributes from a module. So

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:31,560
I guess it allows you to say from module or filename import something. So I

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,790
guess our code that means, that from

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:39,180
something called twilio.rest, we want to import TwilioRestClient.

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,340
Now, this got me curious about what

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,980
these things called Twilio.rest and TwilioRestClient were. So

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,030
then I went back to Google and tried

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,260
to find out how Twilio was actually implemented,

14
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,610
so I typed in Twilio Python Code. Then

15
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,820
I looked through these results and I got to

16
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,300
this website called GitHub. Here I could read

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,530
all of the code that actually makes Twilio work

18
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,260
behind the scenes, by the way, this link

19
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,000
is also available in the instructor notes. Now in

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,480
the code for twilio I find that there was

21
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,640
a folder called twilio so I clicked on it,

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,970
now inside that folder is another folder called rest. And within

23
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:27,520
rest there is a py on file which, if we look through, we will find that there is

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,600
a class called class TwilioRestClient inside it. So when we write this line

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,200
of code from twilio.rest import TwilioRestClient

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,640
what we are telling the computer is, hey, inside Twilio. There

27
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,360
is a folder called rest and inside that folder

28
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,810
is a class called twlio rest client and we are

29
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,010
going to use that class inside our code. And

30
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,260
if we go back and look in our code here

31
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,510
is how we are using that class twilio rest

32
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,870
client. Now you know if we were writing this code

33
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,760
from scratch we probably wouldn't have written this line

34
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,796
of code. We would have modified it to say from

35
00:02:07,796 --> 00:02:15,020
twilio import rest. Now with this line of code, what we are telling the computer

36
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,280
is, hey inside the folder twilio is

37
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,390
another folder called Rest. Import that because we

38
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,850
are going to use that in our program, and we know that inside the folder

39
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,090
rest is the class TwilioRestClient. So I would

40
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,180
now access that class by saying rest. TwilioRestClient.

41
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,450
Let me save, and run this program one more

42
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,470
time to see if it still works. All right?

43
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,530
Here's my phone and let's see if I get

44
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,830
a text message any time soon. [SOUND] Ah-hah! There's

45
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,920
the text message, it seems like our program still

46
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,500
works. So in the next video what I want to

47
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,890
do is revisit the idea of how twilio, rest,

48
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,660
and twilio rest client are related with one another.
