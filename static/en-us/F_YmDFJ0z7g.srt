1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,480
You remember how problem solving works.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,049
We have a state space like this and

3
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:09,849
we're given a start space and
a goal to reach and

4
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:14,989
then we search for a path to find that
goal and maybe we find this path.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,800
Now the way a problem
solving agent would work

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,789
is first it does all the work to
figure out the path to the goal.

7
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:23,789
Just doing by thinking.

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,004
And then starts to execute that path.

9
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:28,111
To drive or walk, or

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,769
however you want to get there from
the start state to the end state.

11
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,439
But think about what would happen
if you did that in real life.

12
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,057
If you did all your planning ahead of
time, you had the complete goal and

13
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:40,363
then, without interacting
with the world.

14
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:44,275
Without sensing it at all you
started to execute that path.

15
00:00:44,276 --> 00:00:46,468
Well this has in fact been studied.

16
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:51,320
People have gone out and
blindfolded walkers.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,520
Put them in the field and
told them to walk in a straight line.

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,040
The results are not pretty.

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,659
Here are the GPS tracks to prove it.

20
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:03,719
So we take a hiker, we put him at
a start location, say here and

21
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,569
we blindfold him so that he can't
see anything in the horizon but

22
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:10,849
just has enough to see his or
her feet so that they

23
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:15,250
won't stumble over something and tell
them execute the plan of going forward.

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,799
Put one step in front of each other and
walk forward in a straight line and

25
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,480
these are the typical paths we see.

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,750
Start out going straight for a while.

27
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,695
But then go in loop de loops.

28
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:27,069
And end up in not at
a straight path at all.

29
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:31,429
These ones over here, starting in this
location, are even more convoluted.

30
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,060
Yet, going straight for a little bit,
and then go in very tight loops.

31
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,879
So, people are incapable
of walking a straight line,

32
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:40,289
without any feedback
from the environment.

33
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,180
Now here, this yellow path,
this one did much better.

34
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,442
And why was that?

35
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:48,764
Well, it's because these paths
were on overcast days and so

36
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:51,769
there was no input to make sense of.

37
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:54,519
Whereas in this path,
was on a very sunny day.

38
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:58,259
And so even though the hiker
couldn't see farther than a few feet

39
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,079
in front of him, he could see shadows.

40
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,280
And say as long as I keep the shadows
pointing in the right direction

41
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,570
then I can go in
a relatively straight line.

42
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:09,758
So the moral is we need some
feedback from the environment,

43
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,049
we can't just plan ahead and

44
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:16,371
come up with a whole plan we've got
to interleave planning and executing.
