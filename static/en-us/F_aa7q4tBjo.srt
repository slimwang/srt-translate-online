If we implement all-gather using the
building block approach of a gather step

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,800
followed by a broadcast step,
is that good or bad?

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,153
Well let's suppose that both gather and

4
00:00:11,153 --> 00:00:14,410
broadcast somehow attain
the lower bounds.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,930
Will the combined primitive
also attain the lower bounds?

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,120
I want you to tell me.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,980
Yes or no.
