00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,863
This is really easy to do considering we are reminded of the general formula

2
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:09,733
right here, and we have values for h and k. We just plug those in to get a final

3
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:14,917
equation of y plus 4 equals x plus 3 squared. Here, the vertex is at negative 3,

4
00:00:14,917 --> 00:00:15,767
negative 4.
