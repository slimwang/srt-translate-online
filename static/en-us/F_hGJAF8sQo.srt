00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,069
One of the interesting things
about learning to use Core Data is

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:05,024
the chance to see
an entire NBC architecture,

3
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:07,830
as envisioned by some
of Apple's developers.

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,880
In this last Core Data lesson we want
to look at a particular issue for NBC.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,110
How should the view code be
notified when the model is updated?

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,385
Core Data encourages two techniques,
NSNotificationCenter and

7
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,800
NSFetchResultsController.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,522
You may recall NSNotificationCenter
from the networking course, but

9
00:00:23,522 --> 00:00:27,420
this FetchResultsController is new and
pretty cool, we think you'll like it.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,600
We recommend that you use
the FetchResultsController

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,280
in the Virtual Tourist app.

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,730
In this lesson we'll show you how
it works in a similar app, and

13
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,780
at the end of the lesson,

14
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,280
we think that you'll be ready to
tackle the fourth portfolio project.
