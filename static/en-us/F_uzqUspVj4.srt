1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Norvig] We're in this range where we might be done but we're not quite sure.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Our computers can do about a billion instructions per second

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
or so on a good second--

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
that is, one where they're not wasting part of the second with a page fault or a cache miss.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If the answer had turned out to be in the millions, we could say, "Oh, great. We're done."

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If it had turned out to be in the trillions, we could say, "It's totally infeasible."

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
"We need a better solution."

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But if it's somewhere in the middle with the billions,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
then we're not quite sure.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We better try to refine the result a little bit to tell if this brute force approach is going to work.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And think of the space of solutions in terms of execution time as like a contour map.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And here deep down in the valley where there's only millions of computations needed,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
millions of instructions needed to complete the answer, then we're really happy

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
because we know that's going to go really fast.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And outside of the happy valley there are these high peaks

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
where we have trillions of computations needed,

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and there we're going to be sad.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If we're stuck out in these domains,

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
we're going to have to somehow find a path back in

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
because we can't just go ahead and calculate when we're out at the trillions.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And in the middle here where we need billions of instructions to complete our computation,

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
then we're not quite sure.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So maybe we're happy here and we can stay in this domain.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Maybe we want to find our path through the wilderness back into the happy valley.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It depends on the problem.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And we're going to try to look at problems in terms of this space,

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
try to find our way back in, but know when to stop when we've got close enough.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now let's keep thinking about what it means to do an assignment.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Try to get just a little bit more concrete about it.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If we want to assign red to house number 1,

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
let's think about the ways in which we could implement that.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Here's 1 possibility where we say we're going to have an array of houses.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We take number 1 and we add red to its set of properties.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That means that each house is represented as a set.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Here's another possibility where we take house number 1,

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
we set its color property equal to red.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Here each house would have to be represented as a user-defined custom class

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
which had properties for color and nationality and so on.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Here's a third possibility.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We have a variable called red,

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and we just assign that the number 1.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So here we were assigning properties to houses,

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and in this one we're assigning houses to properties.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I want you to check all the approaches that you think would be reasonable designs

45
00:02:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
for implementing assignment.
