00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,000
In the last lesson, you heard about
different types of monetization methods

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,800
available to you, but
we kept things at a pretty high level.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,000
>> So now in this lesson we'll
dive into the nitty gritty of what

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,520
you'll need to know
to monetize your app.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,890
By the end, you'll be able to
develop an implementation plan for

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,380
your model, relevant to your product.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,410
You're encouraged to jump
around in this lesson.

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,980
I mean, after all, not all of these
methods are applicable to your product.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,640
We'll provide more information later on,
on where to jump,

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,640
if you know what method you want to use.
