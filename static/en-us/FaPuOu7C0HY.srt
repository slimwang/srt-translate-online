1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,053
The first statement, to decrypt using
DES, the same algorithm is used but

2
00:00:05,053 --> 00:00:08,730
with per-round keys used
in the reversed order.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,830
This is true.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:17,596
Second, with Triple DES the effective
key length can be 56, 112, and 168.

5
00:00:17,596 --> 00:00:18,746
This is true.

6
00:00:18,746 --> 00:00:25,200
Third, each round of DES contains both
substitution and permutation operations.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,300
This is true.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,350
In particular, the mangler function has
the S-boxes that performs substitution.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,050
And the mangler function
also performs permutation.

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,753
Fourth, the logics behind the S-boxes
are well-known and verified.

11
00:00:39,753 --> 00:00:40,813
This is false,

12
00:00:40,813 --> 00:00:45,310
because the design criteria of
S-boxes have been kept a secret.
