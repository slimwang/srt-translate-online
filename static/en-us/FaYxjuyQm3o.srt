1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,223
I know if I pay the full price of the shoes, I have to pay a 100%. But I get 20%

2
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:10,826
off of that price sp I should only pay 80%. I'm going to show you how to finish

3
00:00:10,838 --> 00:00:15,706
this problem out. So, I have 80% of the original cost. I know of means

4
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:21,223
multiplication. So, I have 80% times the original cost which is $60. I'm going

5
00:00:21,223 --> 00:00:26,760
to change my percent to a decimal. I know I need to divide by 100, because it's

6
00:00:26,772 --> 00:00:32,299
percent. So I move the decimal two places to the left, I get 0.8 times $60. I'm

7
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:34,905
going to do 8/10 times $60, I get 48.

8
00:00:34,907 --> 00:00:40,205
So, I only need to pay $48 to get the shoes. That's a pretty good deal. Okay.

9
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,055
Let's try another problem.
