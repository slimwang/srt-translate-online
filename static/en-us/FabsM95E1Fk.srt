1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,020
The sections I outlined above
are things that everyone should include

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,280
in their resume.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,860
But what about those of you who
are making a career change or

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,630
are new to the field or
want to make your personality shine.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,830
If you are making a career change for
example,

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,605
we recommend that you include a summary
statement below your heading section.

7
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:17,015
What is a summary statement?

8
00:00:17,015 --> 00:00:21,325
It is a two to three sentence statement
that functions as resume elevator pitch.

9
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:24,155
It helps to frame your professional
resume, speaks to your passions,

10
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:26,075
strengths, and current career.

11
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:27,725
If this sounds like your background,

12
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:30,365
draft a summary statement
in your master resume.

13
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:33,430
You can customize this later
in your one page resume.

14
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,580
New to the field and
have limited experience.

15
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,150
Be sure to include all the projects and
course work you've completed at Udacity.

16
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,880
Even if you didn't do this at a job,

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,500
these examples will provide
evidence of your work.

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,470
Finally, want to show your personality?

19
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,680
If you feel like your resume
is lacking in interest and

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,010
you have ample space, include
information about any achievements,

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,760
activities, organizations,
and relevant hobbies.

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,710
This helps humanize your resume, and

23
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,260
depending on the company you're applying
to, can convey your culture fit.

24
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,750
Before moving on to the next step,

25
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,900
fill out this section in your
master resume spreadsheet.
