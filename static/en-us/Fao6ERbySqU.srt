00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,019
I'm going to introduce some simple concept of geometrical optics to

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,340
help us understand how light traverses through the lens and

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,430
what happens on the other side of the lens after light has passed through it.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,050
Let's look at a simple example schematic of a lens.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,280
This is referred to as a principle axis and

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,650
we'll look at as light hits this lens and what happens on this side.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,480
So this is a set,

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,695
is the principal axis is a point here which is also the focal length.

9
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:28,220
If you remember the whole concept of the pinhole, that's where we

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,770
want the image to be formed in the camera obscura pinhole camera.

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,800
In this case now when light hits through the lens let's see what happens.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,170
So any light that's parallel to the principle axis, when it

13
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,180
hits the lens will converge to the point where the focal length of that lens is.

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,980
So parallel rays converge at the focal length point of a lens.

15
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,760
Any ray of light that goes through the point of the principal axis will go

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,760
through straight unchanged.

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,370
It will not have any deviations.

18
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:05,340
So any rays of light that basically pass through the center principal point of

19
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,760
a lens will traverse through without any divergence.

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,640
So, in essence, this is the point that behaves like a pinhole.
