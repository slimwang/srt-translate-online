00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,072
So, since this is going to be the height of the box, h or the height, is just

2
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:09,976
equal to x. Remember that we were calling this longest side the length of the

3
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:15,128
box. Can you tell me then, in terms of this initial length of seven inches, and

4
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:20,294
in terms of this cut size x, what will the length of the box be once it's folded

5
00:00:20,294 --> 00:00:20,557
up?
