00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,960
If we zoom in on our terminal buttons, this is what we'll see. The joining of

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,928
the terminal buttons with the neighboring neuron is called the synapse. It

3
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:13,930
causes the release of a neurotransmitter. When the electrical impulse reaches

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,684
the terminal button, where all the neurotransmitters are. It causes a release

5
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:23,490
of the neurotransmitters into what we call the synaptic cleft. At this point,

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,520
the electrical impulse stimulates a chemical change, which releases the

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,761
neurotransmitters. The transmitters carry the signal across the synaptic cleft

8
00:00:33,761 --> 00:00:39,094
to the next neuron. Finally the neurotransmitters reach the receptor sites that

9
00:00:39,094 --> 00:00:44,517
only allow in particular kinds of neurochemicals, so it has to be a match. And

10
00:00:44,517 --> 00:00:49,057
then the process starts all over again. Down the dendrite, through the soma,

11
00:00:49,057 --> 00:00:53,611
down the axon, through the terminal buttons in the synapse and then reaches the

12
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:58,349
next neuron. This is the basis of how nerve cells communicate.
