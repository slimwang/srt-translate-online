1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,870
To solve for

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,520
this question, we only need to use one
tool in addition to the input data tool.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,560
We simply connect the cross
tab tool to the input data.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,951
The field that we're
grouping by is the city,

5
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:19,664
because the records will
be each of the cities.

6
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:21,295
[BLANK_AUDIO]

7
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:25,545
The new column headers
will be the school types,

8
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:30,010
so we choose type,
description, or type, desk.

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,360
The values in the columns
will be the enrollment, and

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,390
since we're looking to summarize
the enrollments by city and

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,370
type, we choose sum as the method.

12
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,641
When we run the workflow,

13
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:52,329
[SOUND] you can see that the school
types are listed across the top.

14
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:56,565
Regular, special ed, vocational,
tech, and other, and

15
00:00:56,565 --> 00:01:00,130
the cities are the individual records.

16
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,750
With the sum of the enrollment
by city and by type.

17
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,160
If we filter the city field for
Laramie, we can see that

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,980
the number of enrollments for
Laramie that are vocational,

19
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,169
technical, and other, is 141.
