1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,800
That ends the lesson on epipolar geometry.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,470
In the next lesson,

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,860
what we're going to assume is that we know the epipolar lines.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,430
In fact, most of what we'll talk about we'll use horizontal, parallel,

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,130
lined up epipolar lines.

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,450
And then we'll go about solving the correspondence problem.
