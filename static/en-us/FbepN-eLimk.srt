1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's observe in more detail why the hospital example gives us such a wrong conclusion.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We study two variables--in-hospital and dying or passing away.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We rightfully observe that these two things are correlated.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If we were to do a scatter plot where we have two categories--

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
whether or not we're in the hospital and whether or not a person passed away--

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
you find there's an increased occurrence of data over here

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and of data over here relative to the other to data points over here.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That means the data correlates.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What does correlation mean?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In any plot, data is correlated if knowledge about one variables tells us something about the other.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is a correlated data plot. Here's another data plot.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Correlated or not? Yes or no?
