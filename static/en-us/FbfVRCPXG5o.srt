00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,760
I've created a simple template here,
and called it menu.html.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,890
A copy of it,
is available in the instructor notes.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:06,720
Take a look at it, and

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,890
see if you can figure out,
how Flask accommodates for escape code?

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,920
You should see a few symbols here,
that don't look like HTML.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,230
Try and see if you can figure out,
what each one of them does.
