00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,970
I've gone ahead and diagrammed what we're seeing in the JSon over here.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,930
We have an education object, which we see right here.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,000
And then inside of it, we have a schools array, which we can see right here.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,900
Key schools, and

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,870
then we know it's value is an array because of these square brackets.

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,360
Inside the schools array, we have two school objects.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,330
And each one of which has a majors array, which we can see right here, and well,

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,520
as a few other key values.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,220
After our schools, we have our online courses.

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,320
Online courses is an array of objects.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,310
Here we have one online course, which is,

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,210
well, the one you're taking right now, JavaScript syntax.
