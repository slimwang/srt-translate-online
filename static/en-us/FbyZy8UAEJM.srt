1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,290
Before we go further,

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,080
let me actually just talk about
the concept of depth in a scene.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,100
Remember we started talking modern
computation photography that we're

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,720
interest in.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,590
Capturing the 3D scene that is lit by
some sort of illumination sources.

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:20,050
We want to use the optics,
the sensor to capture the information

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,870
that actually can be processed
displayed for user to interact with.

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,330
So essentially we're interested in
capturing a photograph in computational

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:34,100
photography that basically captures a 3D
scene, and all of the related geometry.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:34,910
Look around yourself.

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,820
You have a 3D environment, and but in
essence that's what we want to capture

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,930
in a photograph that shows the shape and
size of things around it, and also

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,090
relative information of, how they're
related to each other in shape and size?

14
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:52,230
So an image like this,
in the real world actually has depth.

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,560
That is parts of the image are in front,
parts of them are in the back.

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,590
Here of course there is
some missing detail, but

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,130
you can see the 3D environment or
the 3D information of this scene.

18
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,519
In this case,
just shown from this image.

19
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,420
Now missing information,
we'll talk about that in a bit.

20
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,190
But in essence,

21
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,030
what we want to do is capture images
that also can show the depth.

22
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,850
Here is one example of subtypes
of images, depth image or

23
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,020
sometimes also referred
to as a range image.

24
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,250
All the black pixels here,
basically show the fact that,

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,080
these are all values of zero
considering that's the background.

26
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,990
And everything in front, and
different intensity values show how

27
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,660
close they are,
to my viewpoint in this camera.

28
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,900
The brightest points are of
course the closest, and

29
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,710
the farthest points are black.

30
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,130
Missing information here is of
course represented by black also.

31
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,680
So of course, you really want to
start capturing a 3D environment,

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,020
we need depth, geometry,
and 3D information.

33
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,090
In this lecture we're going to
talk about, how to capture that?
