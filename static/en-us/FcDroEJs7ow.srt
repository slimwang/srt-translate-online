00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,270
Alright so this first of, Bjorn's questions, I'll just read it word

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,830
for word because this is coming straight from the instructor of the

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,380
course. so at first sight, current physics seems to be concerned with

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,910
sophisticated mathematics. Like Riemannian manifolds, self-adjoint

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,552
operators, path integrals over anti-commuting spaces

6
00:00:16,552 --> 00:00:16,630
[LAUGH].

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,555
But, wouldn't it be fair to say that most of this higher mathematics in the end

8
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,400
boils down to differential equations. Even if we're

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,132
dealing with elementary particles or with the entire universe.

10
00:00:26,132 --> 00:00:30,510
>> It almost always has to do with differential equations. it, let

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,930
me take back one phrase, Almost. It always has to do with

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,010
differential equations, yes. It may be

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,220
that other things, other mathematical things

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,000
are more important than the differential equations in this particular area or

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,971
that particular area. But it always has to do with differential equations, yes.

16
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:53,400
>> Why is that? Why is it that differential equations become the

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,860
>> Because what we're interested in is how things vary. You know where physics

18
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,500
is about It's prediction. Basically, to predict

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,580
the future from the present or the future

20
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,750
from the past and that means understanding

21
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,630
how things change. And you not only want

22
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,420
to understand how they change with time,

23
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,100
but you want to understand how they change

24
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,300
with space. You, like for example, you want to

25
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,960
predict the weather. Alright we theoretical physicists usually

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,230
don't predict the weather. But they do predict similar kinds

27
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,700
of things. How do you predict the weather? Well the first

28
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,330
thing you have to know is called an initial condition. You

29
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,980
have to know what the weather is exactly every wheres on

30
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,410
the earth. What does that mean? That means you need to

31
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,760
know the pressure, you need to know the temperature. Whatever it

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,630
is, you need to know the wind velocity, and these are

33
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,470
all a bunch of things which vary from place to place.

34
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,420
So, the first thing you have to input is the conditions at an instant of

35
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,730
time. Now, you want to know how they change. How do they change? They change by

36
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,980
little incremental changes from instant to instant. And

37
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,460
the incremental changes at one position depend on

38
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,060
what's going on in the region nearby that

39
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,520
one position. Whenever you have a situation where

40
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,010
the change in something depends on what's

41
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,260
going on nearby, that's a partial differential

42
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,560
equation. That's a partial. So whenever you're

43
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,570
in the business of predicting how the

44
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:30,050
world changes. Or how some part of the world changes both with respect to

45
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,710
position and with respect to time, you're

46
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,950
in the business of partial differential equations.
