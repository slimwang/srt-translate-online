00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,030
So what I just told you is referred to as the direct linear calibration or

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,490
transform or transformation method.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,250
It has a couple of advantages.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,470
One is, it's pretty simple to formulate and to solve.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,230
Like I said, it's literally, you just take your points, and

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,146
you make that a matrix.

7
00:00:17,146 --> 00:00:18,782
You then do some SVD.

8
00:00:18,782 --> 00:00:20,730
You pull out the column.

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,730
Bang, there's your m.

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,310
Now these methods are referred to as minimizing an algebraic error

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,210
because essentially what we did was we set a m.

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,280
We fixed m to be a unit vector and then algebraically forced found the m

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,510
that gave us the smallest algebraic magnitude of a m.

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,100
There are some disadvantages to this method.

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,350
First is that it doesn't directly tell you about the camera parameters.

16
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,500
But we'll get, we'll fix some of that in just a minute.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,460
It's also approximate because that m was based

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,730
upon a particular matrix based upon pure extrinsic and intrinsic projection.

19
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,820
What if we had something like radial distortion that we could actually model,

20
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,560
but we couldn't model within our projective transform equation.

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,150
How would we do that?

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,020
Suppose I actually knew the focal length, right?

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:17,174
I went out and bought a really expensive lens with focal length 3.746586,

24
00:01:17,174 --> 00:01:19,880
really precise millimeters.

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,450
I don't want my m screwing with that.

26
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,100
It needs to stay that value.

27
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,810
I want to come up with the minimum solution using that precise value.

28
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,130
And then finally, another problem,

29
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,690
I put down mostly, I think it's just another one of those problems.

30
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:40,050
It's not actually minimizing the thing that I really want minimized.

31
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,030
It's minimized this kind of cute algebraic trick that I had.

32
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,180
So, what is it that I actually want to minimize?

33
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,170
Clearly, the amount of weight I put on every holiday.

34
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,440
But besides that, what?

35
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,840
Okay, that was not even a funny joke, but

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,660
it, it was going too long without any jokes.
