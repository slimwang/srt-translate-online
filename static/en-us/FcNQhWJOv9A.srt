1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,534
Our first integration
point is the user input,

2
00:00:02,534 --> 00:00:06,536
Sunshine uses this to determine the
location we should get weather data for.

3
00:00:06,536 --> 00:00:09,679
Our second integration point
is when Sunshine communicates

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,041
with the weather server.

5
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:14,768
The sync adaptor that performs
this action stores the response

6
00:00:14,768 --> 00:00:18,995
in the database as a cache, notifying
Sunshine when new data is ready.

7
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:23,661
The result of either invalid input by
the user or lack of connectivity to

8
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:28,973
the weather servers results in an empty
database, and that means an empty list.

9
00:00:28,973 --> 00:00:33,550
Since an empty list is hardly user
friendly, let's handle that first.
