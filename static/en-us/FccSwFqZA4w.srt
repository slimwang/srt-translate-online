1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,510
The answers are, in this case only the

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,820
second is a correct representation. Any combination is

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,520
possible to be dialed. It's not the case

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,400
that we can, it's only possible to dial the

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,550
correct combination. Now here, we said that the

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,750
lock button works at any point. Whether it's open

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,630
or not, the lock button will always lock

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,650
it. And so that's represented by the third option.

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,870
True implies it's possible to lock.

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:35,760
In this case, the first one is a correct representation of the successor state

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,380
axiom for open, and the second one is not. Because note what it says. If we

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,870
already have the lock open, and then

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,460
we execute some dialing action that's not dialing

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,770
the correct combination X, we want it

15
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,510
to remain open. But this second axiom would

16
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,550
make it be closed, which is not what we want.
