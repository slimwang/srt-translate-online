1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,241
We can factor a 2x from the first two terms and a positive 5 from the second two

2
00:00:05,241 --> 00:00:10,338
terms. We can see that this first term and the second term have a common factor

3
00:00:10,338 --> 00:00:15,171
of 3x plus 2. We factor that out leaving us with 2x plus 5 times the quantity 3x

4
00:00:15,171 --> 00:00:18,067
plus 2. So here's our factored expression.
