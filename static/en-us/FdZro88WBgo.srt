1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,658
Services hang out in the background,
processing, downloading, or

2
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:07,700
uploading data while the phone is locked
or the user is using unrelated apps.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,532
This is nice, but

4
00:00:08,532 --> 00:00:11,989
you might be wondering how services
are started in the first place.

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,220
There are three ways to start a service.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,071
You can manually start a service,
you can schedule a service, or

7
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:20,070
you can bind to a service.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,859
The most straightforward way
to start a service is to call

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,950
the startService method from a context,
such as an activity.

10
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,335
The service will execute, but

11
00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:30,820
will not usually communicate back
to the component which started it.

12
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,996
If you want to have a service execute
at some point in the future, or

13
00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:35,471
when some conditions are met,

14
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,439
you can create a special type
of service called a JobService.

15
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,924
You create your JobService, and
then you define when the job should

16
00:00:41,924 --> 00:00:46,140
run using a scheduler, like
JobScheduler or Firebase JobDispatcher.

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,637
They allow you to define complex
run schedules for your service,

18
00:00:49,637 --> 00:00:52,509
like have a service run
every 24 hours when on WiFi.

19
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:54,899
Then the scheduler schedules the job for
you.

20
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,347
We'll be talking about scheduling
services like this in greater detail

21
00:00:58,347 --> 00:00:58,748
later.

22
00:00:58,747 --> 00:01:02,890
Finally, a bindService offers
a client server-like interface.

23
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,861
With your service being the server and

24
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:08,320
the various components binding to
the service being the clients.

25
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,699
Components bind to the service
using the bindService method.

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,210
Unlike started services, which you
tend to start and then forget about.

27
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,712
Bound services can easily communicate
back to the components that are bound to

28
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:19,489
them.

29
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:23,469
An example of when you might use a bound
service is a media player application.

30
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:25,844
You might have a bound
service which plays audio and

31
00:01:25,844 --> 00:01:27,819
an activity which controls the UI.

32
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:31,734
It's important to use a bound service as
oppose to a started service because you

33
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:35,140
probably want to update the UI to
represent where in the audio you are.

34
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,495
If you press the Pause button in the
activity, you might also want to send

35
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:41,400
additional commands to
the service from the activity.

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,070
Note that a service being bound or
started is not mutually exclusive.

37
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:46,649
A service can be both.

38
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,830
We'll be using services
in Sunshine in two ways.

39
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:52,091
First, when the user
changes their location,

40
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:55,959
new weather data needs to be immediately
downloaded in the background.

41
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:59,444
Secondly, weather data should
be downloaded on a regular

42
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:01,229
schedule in the background.

43
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,130
Because of this, I won't say
much more about bound services.

44
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:07,589
But if you're curious about them,
I've provided some links below.

45
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,229
I'll be focusing on started services and
scheduled job services.

46
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:13,269
Let's talk about started services first.
