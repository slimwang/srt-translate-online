00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,600
Let's take a look at Muzei.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,720
Muzei, is a live wallpaper application
that displays a new work of

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,760
art as your background every day.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,080
If you go and check out the source code,
in addition to Roman,

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,560
you'll see Ian Lake
listed a number of times.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,510
You might remember him from our advanced
Android App Development course with

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,362
Joanna and Dan.

8
00:00:22,362 --> 00:00:26,530
Muzei, is a good example, because it
makes extensive use of dimensions files

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,400
to make its UI work on
multiple form factors.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,440
So I went ahead and

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,030
downloaded the source code from the link
listed in the instructor's notes.

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,270
Now in this dimensions file, this is for

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,350
the tablet screen,
with the smallest width of 600 dips.

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:49,180
And we can see that we have a number
of dimensions listed in here.

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,190
We also have a general
dimensions file that lists many

16
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:59,960
of the same properties,
just with different dimensions.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,260
Now, if we go to our activity, we can
see how we use these dimensions, so

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,630
instead of specifying the dips
right here, we're using @dimen and

19
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,480
then the name that was specified
in the dimension file.

20
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,410
Now Android Studio does
a couple of things for you.

21
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,170
So, sometimes you'll see
the dimensions like this,

22
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,300
where they're listed in green.

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,020
If you ever see a property that's
listing gray, that means that

24
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,620
Android Studio is showing you
the value that it's pointing to.

25
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,430
So if you hover over one of these,

26
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,490
you can see the dimension value that
Android Studio is pulling from.
