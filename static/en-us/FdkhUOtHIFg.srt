Before we wrap up this lesson, let's hear from Eytan and Sean, who are also

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,960
two data scientists at Facebook. They'll offer

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,370
their advice for how to work with data.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,100
>> My advice to data scientists, or future data

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,370
scientists is find data sets that you're interested in,

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,690
and, and work with them, and play with the

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,950
data. And just developed experience with playing with data.

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,350
>> Good data science comes from good

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,440
questions, not from fancy techniques, or from, you know, having the right

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,130
data. It comes from motivating your research with an idea that you care

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,690
about, and that you think other people will care about. It's almost, you

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,730
almost have to think about it like a journalist would. You have this

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,430
audience and they're going to consume the work that you produce, and you

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,070
want them to care about it, and be interested. And so, starting with

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,920
the right questions, in, in particular, something that motivates you as a person

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,460
is really the right starting point, not, like, you know, some fancy technique

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,050
that you want to learn.
