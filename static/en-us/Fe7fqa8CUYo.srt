00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, we just mentioned a bunch of terms that you may not be familiar with.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,644
Visual cortex, occipital lobe, motor cortex, frontal lobe and motor and sensory

3
00:00:09,644 --> 00:00:14,724
neurons. Don't worry. The rest of this lesson we will elaborate and discuss

4
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:19,406
these important parts of the brain. We will start with the smallest unit of

5
00:00:19,406 --> 00:00:23,053
communication, the neuron. And then, discuss different kinds of neural

6
00:00:23,053 --> 00:00:27,010
chemicals that make different experiences and different actions possible.

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,830
Finally, we will learn all of the major brain structures and their function.

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,860
The nervous system is comprised of cells. Which is what we will look at next to

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,099
see what the building blocks of the nervous system are.
