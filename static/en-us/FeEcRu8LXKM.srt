00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:06,509
For these two functions, f of f inverse of x, just gives us x. And f inverse of

2
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,637
f of x also gives us x. Remember that when we create composite functions, what

3
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:16,610
we're doing is taking the output of the function that's on the inside. And

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,570
using it as the input for the function that's on the outside. This seems pretty

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,862
uncanny that we end up with x for both of these compositions. Maybe we're on to

6
00:00:25,862 --> 00:00:26,789
something here.
