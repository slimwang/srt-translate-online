00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,910
Now that we've got GigaGal running and

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,650
jumping, she really needs
something to jump on.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,600
Let's add the eponymous platforms
to this platforming game.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,610
First we'll talk about the mechanics
of how GigaGal will interact with

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,740
the platforms.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,060
And then we'll add pretty
9-patch platforms to the game.

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,190
Then we'll figure out the details
of how to check when GigaGal should

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,780
land on a platform and
when she should fall back off the side.

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,590
Finally, you'll make your own
platforming challenge course.

10
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,140
Let's get to it
