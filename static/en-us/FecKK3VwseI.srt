Bertrand Mayer, author of the Eiffel programming language has

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,610
proposed the open-closed principle: that a class should be open for

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,940
extension but closed for modification.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,980
The implication is that after you have released the class, any enhancement to it

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,870
should be made only in subclasses. This policy, this policy will help deal with

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,720
the fragile base class problem that we mentioned in an earlier lesson.
