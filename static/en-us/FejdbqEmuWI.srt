1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,500
So now we've talked about how the cache works for

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,580
updating normal files from the cache. Now the whole app

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,860
cache system is actually very complex. It's a very complex

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,670
algorithm that the browser goes through to get files out of

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,230
the cache, figure out whether it should update the cache,

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,010
check the different sections in the file. We do want to

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,980
talk briefly about the network section for files that always

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,490
need to be loaded from the network, so let's go take

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,290
a look at that. The network section was supposed

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,750
to make it easier to build applications that were

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,690
occasionally online, but it turns out that's pretty hard

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,400
to do. As we talked about before, it's hard to

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,320
answer the question definitively if you're online or offline.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,840
One common thing to do is in the network section

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,480
at the bottom to put a star, or even

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,950
just to only have a star here. This basically means

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,130
anything that anything we haven't specified already further up in

18
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,560
the application cache in the cache section, you should just

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,220
go to the network for. This is actually isn't a

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,960
great thing to do. If you have any blocking resources

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,240
in your file, or in your application that haven't been

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,360
listed in the cache file, it's going to sit there and

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,200
wait until it times out. So what you should really

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,990
do, is develop without that network star. Even if you add

25
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,300
it later. That way, your cache updates in the

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,270
console will actually show you if you're missing files.
