1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In this case--this wasn't intended to be a super hard question--

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
as n grows there seems to be a linear relationship.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Doubling n seems to double the time.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That was the answer that I was looking for.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Of course, it makes a lot of sense when you think about what naive is actually doing.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's switch back to naive for a moment and look to see what it's doing.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It takes whatever value is passed in as a, and it runs a loop.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The number of times that it goes through this loop is exactly equal to a.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If you double a, it's going to double the number of times it goes through this loop

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and double the overall time.
