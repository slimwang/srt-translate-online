00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,710
Let's look at the solution to
our N-module redundancy quiz

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,550
where we had three computers that are
totally identical on the same desk, and

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,840
we use them as a three module or
redundant system.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,239
And the question is what type
of event can we always overcome?

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,920
A single alpha particle strike is going
to effect only a single processor, and

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,690
that means that the two computers
that are not affected by this will

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,405
still agree.

8
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:29,905
A building collapse will
either be another building and

9
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:33,595
not affect anything, but if it is
the building in which these systems are,

10
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:37,115
then the building collapse is probably
going to destroy all three computers, so

11
00:00:37,115 --> 00:00:39,740
we cannot tolerate this type of event.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,870
Earthquake is going to do
a similar thing, and a mistake

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,810
in processor design, because the three
are identical, if there is a mistake in

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,530
processor design it's going to affect
all three processors at the same time.

15
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,300
So, again, we cannot tolerate this.

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,940
So as you can see, replicating
the hardware with identical hardware and

17
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,280
in an identical location

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,910
only really ensures that we can survive
something like a particle strike.

19
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,390
If we wanted to tolerate earthquakes and
building collapses,

20
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,900
we would need to geographically
distribute these three computers.

21
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,120
If we want to tolerate
a mistake in processor design,

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,102
we would need to use three computers
with different processors.

23
00:01:20,102 --> 00:01:24,850
So the N-module
redundancy doesn't really

24
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:29,990
guard against these types of
faults unless the modules

25
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,200
are in different places and
of different designs.
