1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,546
This Hyperbolas is centered at three negative 2, has an a value of two and a b

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:11,493
value of 3. Great thinking if you got all three correct. We know the center is

3
00:00:11,493 --> 00:00:16,384
at three negative two, since we have the opposite sign in the parenthesis. So

4
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:21,010
this is our h and this is our k. H will be positive 3, the opposite sign of

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:27,766
negative 3, and k will be negative 2, the opposite sign of positive 2. This is

6
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:32,723
our center for our hyperbola. Finding a and b are the same as just before. We

7
00:00:32,723 --> 00:00:38,020
just take the square root of this to get a, and the square of this to get b.

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,284
Now we're ready to graph our hyperbola. We start by graphing an ellipse with a

9
00:00:42,284 --> 00:00:47,645
center of positive 3 and negative 2. So, positive 3 on the x, negative 2 on the

10
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:53,052
y, here's our new center. We go two units in the x direction and three units in

11
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:58,692
the y direction to get the remaining points. But we're not really graphing an

12
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:04,040
ellipse, we're graphing a hyperbola. So we draw a dashed rectangle around our

13
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,160
ellipse and then we draw in the 2 diagonals. We know our hyperbola is going to

14
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,860
open to the left and to the right, since the x squared term is positive. So we

15
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,010
split our ellipse in half, and then we pivot the two sides outward and extend

16
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,200
them to the diagonals. This gives us our hyperbola.
