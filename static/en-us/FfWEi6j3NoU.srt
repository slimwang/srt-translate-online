1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,100
Let's start by undoing our latest change
and delete the photo frame entity.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,508
So the model is as it was before.

3
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:10,052

4
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:13,150
Now we must create a new
version of our model.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,510
Add model version.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,550
You can call it however you want.

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:25,170
Model two seems reasonable and
it's based on our current model.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,670
Now you can see that we have
two different model versions.

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,900
However, the previous one is
still marked as the current one.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,670
We need to change that.

11
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:44,850
To change the current version of
your model, select your model.

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,750
And then, in the file inspector,
look for model version.

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,780
And current should be Model 2.

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,020
So now we have our new version
marked as the current one.

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,772
We should make all the changes
back to this new version.

16
00:01:01,772 --> 00:01:07,625
So let's go ahead and
add the photo frame entity back.

17
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:12,841

18
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:16,736
The last step, is to make a minor
change in our core data stack,

19
00:01:16,736 --> 00:01:22,040
to make sure that it does the migration
from version one to version two.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,790
We do this by adding two simple
options to the persistent coordinator.

21
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,010
Let's get it done.

22
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,490
We create a dictionary of options and

23
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,944
one is
NSMigratePersistentStoreAutomaticallyOp-

24
00:01:34,944 --> 00:01:38,000
tion which is pretty
obvious what it's doing.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,150
And we're setting it to true.

26
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,840
We want to migrate.

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,260
And we're also telling the persistent
store to infer the mapping model.

28
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,060
So we're telling you,

29
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,930
find out how you should migrate from
version one to version two, and

30
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:59,100
we simply pass these options when we
add a store coordinator and that's it.

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,310
Now it's your turn.

32
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,050
Grab your x code and
create a new version of your model.
