For Sunshine,

2
00:00:01,389 --> 00:00:05,449
building a content provider is just
one part of managing weather data.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,060
And unlike the to-do list app,

4
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:10,339
you won't be attaching your
provider methods to the UI.

5
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:14,449
Instead, you'll only code those
methods in the Weather Provider class.

6
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,050
And to make sure they're
working correctly,

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,230
you'll be testing them
with Android test classes.

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,339
Test classes that you see if a method or
object is working like you expected to.

9
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:28,579
Without the need for UI code and
without any risk of crashing your app.

10
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:32,939
These tests exist in a package that's
separate from the main app package.

11
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,799
And in the Sunshine exercises,

12
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,479
you'll find test classes called test
URI Matcher and Test Weather Provider,

13
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:42,369
that you can run to make sure
your code is working as expected.

14
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:44,649
If your code is complete and

15
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:49,259
you run these tests, Android Studio will
give you a message saying you passed.

16
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:53,250
But if something is wrong, like if you
forgot to set a notification or return

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,049
an incorrect value, you'll get a message
saying that a test has failed and why.

18
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:00,309
And the feedback you get
should help you go back and

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,800
correct any minor coding errors.

20
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,030
Professional programmers often rely
on tests to make sure that their code

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,114
is working every step of the way.

22
00:01:08,114 --> 00:01:10,795
So this is also
an important skill to have.

23
00:01:10,795 --> 00:01:13,534
In the following text,
you'll be given some short instructions

24
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:16,534
on how to use the test
classes provided in Sunshine.

25
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,375
Then you can start building
the Weather Provider.
