Mora just described the investigation where she estimated people's audience

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,500
size. I want you to think about a time when you

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,390
posted a specific message or shared a photo on Facebook. What

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,360
was that message, and how many of your friends do you

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,020
think actually saw that exact post? And finally, what percent of

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,930
your friends do you think saw the post? The results of

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,470
Mora's investigation we reveal a little bit later in the course.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,550
But just so you know, there's no right or wrong answers

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,370
for these. Keep your guesses in mind, and then you can

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,580
compare them to the results that Mora found in her study. Write

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,790
about your message or your post here and then enter two numbers

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,140
here and here. And there's no need to include a percent sign.
