00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,019
Apple defined Swift functions as
self-contained to chunks of code

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,460
that perform a specific task.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,060
There are three main types
of functions and swift.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,590
Global functions,
Nested functions, and methods.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,790
Nested functions
are slightly more advanced.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,410
So we're going to focus on global
functions and methods for the moment.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,410
Global functions are functions that
can be called from anywhere in an app.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,720
Global function syntax is easy to
recognize because global functions

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,820
are called by a particular object.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,520
They're just called sort
of floating in thin air.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,200
One global function that you're
sure to be intimately familiar with

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,950
by now is print.

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,950
Global functions like print can be
called from anywhere within a class.

14
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,460
On the other hand,
when a function is defined in

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,600
an associated with a particular class,
we call that function a method.

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,370
The vast majority of Swift functions
that you write and call will be methods.

17
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,540
Here we have a method called sum of
strings which you may remember from your

18
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,610
exercises.

19
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,750
It's defined within
the arithmetic class.

20
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,480
And is also called by an instance
of the arithmetic class.
