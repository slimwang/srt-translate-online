1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,700
Alright, you're in trouble Sara. You've gotta, you gotta get the 64 over.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:09,440
>> Yeah, I'm working on it. I have to get the, the 16 up to 64 status so I can.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:09,610
>> oh.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,200
>> Oh, I might actually lose this.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,740
>> You're going to lose.

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,600
>> Oh, no.

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,880
>> Sara, this looks bad. This is looking pretty bad.

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,490
>> Wait, before you lose on camera, let's do our introduction.

9
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:18,990
>> No, look.

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,120
>> Okay. Well, I'm going to say hi.

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,820
>> Well, slightly better.

12
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,600
>> All right, fine. Hi, I'm Andy.

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,880
>> And I'm Sarah.

14
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,540
>> And I'm addicted

15
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,400
to 2048. No, I'm actually an Udacity instructor

16
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,769
>> Who's also addicted to 2048 [LAUGH].

17
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:32,060
>> Who's also addicted to 2048.

18
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,110
>> Yeah, and I am Sarah. I am

19
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,120
a software engineer and, of course, a developer here.

20
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,910
>> And as I have mentioned, a lot of people at our office

21
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,690
are really addicted to this game and we decided it would be a

22
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,460
good way to start experimenting with

23
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,100
short courses, making really small course that

24
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,780
hopefully, a lot of people will get a lot of enjoyment out of.

25
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,720
>> Yeah. So this course isn't going to teach

26
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,320
you how to play the game. It's not

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,520
even going to teach you how to program the game.

28
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,270
Instead, we're, we're going to talk about how to

29
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,230
modify the existing code to make it your own.

30
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,390
>> Right. And I actually went through this experience on my own about a

31
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,250
week ago. I'm a pretty novice programmer.

32
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,870
I've learned what I know through Udacity classes

33
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,340
actually on the job and going through this code base and looking at how

34
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,590
the HTML and the CSS and the

35
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,230
JavaScript interacted. That was a really valuable experience.

36
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,330
So I'm actually really excited to share this with

37
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,170
you guys and make our own versions of 2048.

38
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,230
>> Yeah. So the thing that makes

39
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,330
this project especially useful as a teaching aid

40
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,910
here is that it's an open source project,

41
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,900
meaning that anybody can look at all the

42
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,910
code. They can take it and modify it. They could push their changes back to the

43
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,700
original but most people are just sort of

44
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,170
making their own like fun thing. In fact,

45
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,570
there are a couple of them that have made it pretty big.

46
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,160
>> Should we take a look?

47
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,230
>> Yeah. Let's look at a couple of those.

48
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:47,380
>> All right.
