1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now let's move on to a slightly more complicated question:

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
out of all the families with two kids--

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
with at least 1 boy, born on a Tuesday--

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
what's the probability of two boys?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Now, you might think that the answer should be the same--

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
it should still be 1/3 because why does Tuesday matter?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
After all, the kid's gotta be born sometime

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and if it happens to be Tuesday,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
why would that be any different than any other day?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So is it 1/3?

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, as Gottfried Leibniz said, "Let us calculate."

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So we have the technology to model that.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
First, a random variable for day of the week-_

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and I had to fool around with the capitalization there,

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to make sure that we have 7 distinct letters:

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday--

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
plus ample space of two<u>kids</u>bday,

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
one kid with their day of birth;

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
the second kid, with their day of birth.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What does that look like? Well, it's this huge thing

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
of (2 X 7 X 2 X 7) entries.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The first one: Boy born on Sunday;

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
boy born on Sunday, all the way through

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
to the last one: girl born on Saturday, girl born on Saturday.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Then a boy born on Tuesday is all the elements of this,

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
where "BT" appears is in the string.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So either "BT" will be the first 2 characters or the last 2 characters.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And now we're finally at the point

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
where we can say: given at least 1 boy_tuesday,

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
what's the probability of two_boys?

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And before I show the results,

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm going to ask you what you think it is.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You could follow along, either with pencil and paper

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
or do the computation or just think it out in your head.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So Enter as a fraction. If you think it's 1/3,

36
00:01:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
put a 1 here and a 3 here--or whatever.
