00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,090
Here's my decimal. I know I need to move it to the left side of 1, so I have to

2
00:00:04,102 --> 00:00:08,207
move it this way. My decimal definitely moves left. Let's make sure it keeps

3
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:12,179
going. Now that I have it on the other side of 1, on the left side of 1, I can

4
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:16,580
move the decimal again. When I move the decimal to the left, I create a 0 in

5
00:00:16,592 --> 00:00:21,345
that place value. So I move from tenths to hundredths. And here, when I move the

6
00:00:21,357 --> 00:00:25,878
decimal again, I'm going to go from hundredths to thousandths. When I move the

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,354
decimal left, I create a 0 for a place holder, and I move from hundredths to

8
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:32,509
thousandths. Nice work on that quiz.
