1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:00,930
All right.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,200
Well, using all the skills that you've
learned throughout this course,

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,820
it's time to make some final
tweaks to the home town site.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,850
To start off, I want you to
update the sports score table.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,050
Go ahead and put your favorite sports
teams in, and make sure it's responsive.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,530
I've also added another column into
the sports score table just to

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,370
make things a little bit more difficult.

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,270
Next up, double check your text.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,540
Is there any text that's too long?

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,350
If so, find a way to make it fit
a little bit more naturally.

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,950
This is also a great place to
add some minor breakpoints.

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,240
Add at least one, or

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,840
I'm sure if you keep trying, you could
find a lot more than just one to add.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,490
Lastly, try replacing a few of
the images with responsive images.

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,500
If you haven't completed the responsive
images course, check out the responsive

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,940
images section of Web Fundamentals
using the link in the instructor notes.

17
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,370
And when you're done, make sure you
share your project in the forums.

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,150
That's the best way to get feedback and
make improvements.
