When you wrote your winner and
loser methods,

2
00:00:02,798 --> 00:00:05,709
you may have gotten an error
reading something like this.

3
00:00:05,709 --> 00:00:11,420
No visible interface for 'RPSTurn'
declares the selector 'defeats'.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,270
Selector here refers to the message or
the method being called.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,830
And interface refers to
the public interface for

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,990
RPSTurn that's found in its header file.

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,960
Defeats is not visible to the winner and
loser methods.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,700
Because, just like we saw with
properties, in order for a method to be

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,450
visible outside of its class it must
be included in the header file.

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,120
So we'll open up the header file for
RPSturn.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,830
And we'll include
the defeats method here.

12
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,470
Now if we go back to our winner and

13
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,110
loser methods, we can see that
the compiler error has gone away.
