1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,190
We will begin building our database for

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,020
Sunshine by defining
our weather contract.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,750
You might ask, what is a contract?

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,340
A contract is an agreement between
the data model, storage, and

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,730
views, presentation,
describing how information is accessed.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,560
The agreement in a contract is
implemented in a contract class that

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,270
contains a list of constants, typically
database table column names, that

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,500
are used to associate data from the data
source within the UI of an application.

9
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,630
So, if this represents the user
interface, then the bottom table

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,030
represents the data source that is
being used to feed data to the UI.

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,190
Each column in the data source
represents a UI element.

12
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,450
If we search developer.android.com for
the word,

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,470
contract, we see that there
are many such contracts to find.

14
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:52,410
In the Contacts Contract, for example,

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,800
we can see that part of the contract
contains a list of column names.

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,680
And we can have some sense of what
the contact database looks like.

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,319
It has a column for the display name,
flags for the contact, columns for

18
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,400
ID's that are used to link
the contact to data in other tables.

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,650
And columns for URI's that point to
images associated with the contact.

20
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,880
In Sunshine,
our contract is used to both create and

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,950
interact with our database tables.

22
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,670
Which is why we need to define it at
the start of building our database.

23
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,910
Of course, to create our contract,

24
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,780
we first need to know what we
need to store in the database.
