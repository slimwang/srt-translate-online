00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,760
And now we're back to the final project, and this

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,930
is the fun part. So this is where you should

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,850
go through your app, to find opportunities for contextual awesomeness,

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,463
and then, keep searching for inspiration. This may mean researching Google

5
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:18,242
Play services more or checking out the repository of awesomeness.

6
00:00:18,242 --> 00:00:20,925
But once you've figured out something out that you think you

7
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:22,766
can do that you really add to your app, add

8
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:25,552
call outs to your prezzy that will help other people understand

9
00:00:25,552 --> 00:00:29,420
what that awesomeness is. And of course, you must obey

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,020
the two prime directives, which are to always be purposeful and

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,630
respectful. Just because a feature exists doesn't mean you need to

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,770
put it in. And of course, don't be creepy. Good luck.
