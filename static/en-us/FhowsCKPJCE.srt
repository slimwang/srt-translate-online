1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is that we start off knowing nothing,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
so we're in this belief state here where any of

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
the 8 possible states are possibilities.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Then our path to the goal is to move right, and we arrive in this belief state,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and then suck up the dirt there.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then move left, and then suck up the dirt there,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and we end up in a belief state with only a single world state,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and that's one that reaches the goal where we're on the left

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and both squares are clean.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And yes, that is guaranteed to reach the goal.
