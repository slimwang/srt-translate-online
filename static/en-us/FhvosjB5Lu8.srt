1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,230
If you are the person who has
to champion cyber security and

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,650
get the company to a proactive
cyber security posture,

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,220
how do you make your case?

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:15,250
You're champion, it's your job to
be as well prepared as possible

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,470
given the cost benefits and
risk tolerance and so on.

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,470
What are the kind of
arguments you can make?

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,820
The easiest argument to make is
the bottom line argument, or

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,540
the economic argument that
it's going to save us money.

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,380
Of course security doesn't make money.

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,050
Security we would say it's a cost.

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,150
It doesn't bring money in, but
we could lose money because of that.

12
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:42,020
The economic argument we can make is,
the return on investment argument, or

13
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,260
the ROI argument.

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,870
Saying, if you don't do this,
we're going to lose $10 million.

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:53,140
If you do this, it's only going to cost
us 1 million and we save 5 million and

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,010
the losses we're going to suffer
are going to be reduced by half.

17
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,010
Then of course it's
an investment you make,

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,090
you're putting out one million but
you're saving five million.

19
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,780
So that is a pretty good return
on investment that we have.

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,920
So the economic argument of course
makes sense when you say that

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,238
by coming up with a budget
to put a control in place.

22
00:01:13,238 --> 00:01:17,210
The cost of that we're going to
have Is going to result in savings

23
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,020
that are much greater than the cost.

24
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,810
Significant savings
greater than the cost, so

25
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,220
there is in a way a return
on the investment.

26
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,940
This is money we're going to lose
that we're not going to lose now.

27
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,380
And that's how our bottom line is
going to be in a better state.

28
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,480
Of course this does require that you
estimate the cost benefits that we're

29
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,130
talking about, and unfortunately,
it's pretty tricky.

30
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,090
Cost and benefits,
either you can exactly quantify them, so

31
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,536
that would be data driven,
or its perception.

32
00:01:46,536 --> 00:01:50,960
So with perception it's sort of what
they perceived to be the risk, and what

33
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,200
they perceived the risk reduction, maybe
if we do A or B, or something like that.

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,430
Versus sort of actually knowing
those probabilities and

35
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,650
those impact numbers that
you are talking about.

36
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,800
So you're going to make an argument.

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,080
This is all fine and good, but
a lot of times it comes to perception,

38
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,940
and then people would say,
well, this is their opinion.

39
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,940
How do you know for sure?

40
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,252
Do you have some hard numbers?

41
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:15,610
And unfortunately, making this
argument is difficult because

42
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,590
a lot of times those hard
numbers are not easy to come by.
