1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,170
So now let's do a quick quiz talking about the order of

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,110
operations in text processing.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,920
We've talked about two important steps that you'll use often when

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,000
you're doing text processing.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,210
One is the bag of words representation, and the other is word stemming.

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,470
And here's a quiz for you.

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,860
Let's suppose that you want to do both these operations to your text.

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,710
You want to have stemmed words in a bag of words representation.

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,730
Which one of these steps should you do first?
