One cheap technique to give a material a slightly different look is to use

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,260
what's called wrap lighting. Remember with toon rendering, how we shifted where

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,300
the diffuse term went from light to dark? We can do the same sort of shift with

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,540
the diffuse term, but not simply threshold the value. You're task is to change

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,300
the diffuse term to be this wrap lighting term. See the additional course

material for more information about how this works. When you're done the ramp

00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,200
slider will suddenly alter the look of the surface. This equation is from an

article on skin rendering by Simon Green. This lighting change is not a huge

00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,310
effect for teapots but can give a more realistic look to some materials.
