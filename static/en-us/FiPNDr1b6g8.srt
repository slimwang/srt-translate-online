Hi, my name is Jay and

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,110
I'm the course developer of
the Advanced Android Development and

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,000
Google services classes.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,220
I'm here to introduce
you to Project Zero.

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,620
Project Zero is the first
project of your nanodegree.

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,570
And while it's not required for

7
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,150
graduation, it's a really good way to
get started building apps right away.

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,850
This project will be a central hub
from which you can launch the other

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,300
apps you'll be building.

10
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,860
For now, each of these buttons will
just display a little message that says

11
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,660
something like, this button will
launch my media streamer app.

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,260
As soon as you learn
about direct intents and

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,690
developing Android apps, you'll be able
to launch the other apps you'll build as

14
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,980
part of your Nanodegree
from these buttons.

15
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,530
Whenever you finish another project,
you can come here to update this hub,

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,040
keeping your whole Nanodegree
portfolio within easy reach.

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,900
To make this app you'll need to
complete five steps laid out in

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,436
detail in the next node.

19
00:00:45,436 --> 00:00:49,880
You'll install Android Studio, create
new project, customize your layout,

20
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,360
tie each button to code, and
launch a message from each button.

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,930
With that,
you'll have built your very first app.

22
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,610
Welcome again, to the Android
Developer Nanodegree, and good luck.
