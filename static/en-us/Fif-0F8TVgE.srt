>> We can write 0 is less than or equal to x, which is less than or equal to 15.

2
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:09,446
X is greater than or equal to 0 can be written in, in a different way, as 0 is

3
00:00:09,446 --> 00:00:13,751
less than or equal to x. Now if we put this side by side with our other

4
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:18,140
inequality and we match up the x's in the same spot, we end up with this

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,709
compound inequality.
