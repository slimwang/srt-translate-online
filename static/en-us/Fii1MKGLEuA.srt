1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,800
Another relationship that we have to understand is

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,870
the one between fabrication cost and our chip area.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,420
Chips are manufactured by taking a silicone disk, called

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,130
a wafer, and subjecting it to a number of

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,290
steps. Each of these steps sort of prints some

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,210
of the aspects of the circuitry that should be

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,690
appearing on each processor. And there are a number

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,546
of these steps. At the end of these steps,

9
00:00:25,546 --> 00:00:27,809
we take the wafer and we cut it up, and

10
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:31,021
each one of these small, squarish things is going to be

11
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:34,340
a chip. So this is a single chip. We take

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,150
each chip and we put it in a package. Has pins

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,710
on it. So this is what you normally see as

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,520
a chip. And then we test these chips. The ones

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,822
that check out fine, we can sell. The ones that

16
00:00:47,822 --> 00:00:51,050
don't check out fine, we throw away because they don't work.

17
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,605
It is important to understand that the manufacturing

18
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:57,212
process up to cutting the chips up is all

19
00:00:57,212 --> 00:00:59,636
the same. The wafer is this. Is about

20
00:00:59,636 --> 00:01:03,116
12 inches in diameter. It cost thousands of dollars

21
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:06,355
to put it through the manufacturing process, at

22
00:01:06,355 --> 00:01:08,725
which point we hope we get a number of

23
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:12,201
working chips and very few non-working chips, but

24
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:16,320
the size of the chip significantly affects the cost.

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,230
Again this entire process pretty much has a fixed

26
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,590
cost. If we have more chips here because they are

27
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,846
smaller, we will divide the wafer cost by the number

28
00:01:26,846 --> 00:01:29,436
of many good chips that we get and our chips

29
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:32,534
will be cheaper. If we have very large chips, we

30
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:35,642
will get fewer of them when we test them especially

31
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:38,528
and we will divide this cost with fewer chips to

32
00:01:38,528 --> 00:01:41,400
get the cost. So it seems like the cost of

33
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,480
a single chip is going to be linearly proportional to

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,650
its size, but in fact, things are worse than that.
