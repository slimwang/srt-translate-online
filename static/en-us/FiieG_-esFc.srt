1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,897
For the first inequality, I have x is less than 3. If you have trouble

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:08,451
remembering the less than symbol, remember that the arrow points to the left, or

3
00:00:08,463 --> 00:00:12,844
to numbers less than zero. I know I need a parenthesis because I can't be equal

4
00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:17,188
to. So, it must be the number line 2 or number line 4. I want numbers lower than

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,913
3, because x is less than 3, so it must be 4. For the interval notation, I want

6
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:26,641
numbers that are from negative infinity all the way up to 3. So, that must be b.

7
00:00:26,747 --> 00:00:31,325
For x greater than or equal to 3, I want to use a bracket, that's number line 1.

8
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:36,053
The interval notation would be d because I get d equal to 3 and then have any

9
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:38,915
number bigger or up to positive infinity.

10
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:43,226
Here, I have 3 is greater than or equal to x. I'm used to seeing the variable on

11
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:47,520
the left side, so I'm going to flip this in equality around. I need to make sure

12
00:00:47,532 --> 00:00:51,689
that the arrow still points to the x when I switch this inequality around. I

13
00:00:51,776 --> 00:00:55,947
want 3 to be greater than or equal to x, and I want x to be less than or equal

14
00:00:55,959 --> 00:01:00,625
to 3. For the number line, it must be at number 3. I need a bracket at 3 and my

15
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:04,968
values could be less than or equal to 3. The interval notation would be a. I

16
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,527
could have numbers from negative infinity all the way up, and equal to 3. This

17
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:13,871
must mean that the last one is 2c. I want numbers greater than 3. Here are

18
00:01:13,883 --> 00:01:19,069
numbers greater than 3 and here are numbers between 3 and positive infinity.
