1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,458
Well, we should multiply the first fraction by s squared divided by s

2
00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:09,487
squared.This would give us s squared over 2ks squared. I know I multiply this

3
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:14,546
first fraction by s squared divided by s squared. S squared is missing from the

4
00:00:14,546 --> 00:00:19,586
2k. If we multiply s squared by 2k, we'll get 2ks squared, which would be the

5
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:24,597
new denominator or our lowest common denominator. For the second fraction, we

6
00:00:24,597 --> 00:00:29,105
only need to multiply by k over k. 2s squared times k would give us our lowest

7
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:33,149
common denominator. 2k s squared. Keep in mind that we're really just

8
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,752
multiplying by a form of 1 in both of these cases. We're not changing the value

9
00:00:37,752 --> 00:00:40,644
of the fractions, we're just changing what they look like.
