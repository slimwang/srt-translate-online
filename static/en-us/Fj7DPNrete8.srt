1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
Now the hardest part is done.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,870
We have a problem we know to be NP complete,

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,600
and that problem SAT.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,930
So from now on, showing that other problems are NP complete

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,670
will get a lot easier,

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,540
because we don't have to go through this

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,560
laborous process n coding machines anymore

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,590
It will just suffice to show that SAT

9
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,130
can be reduced the the problem we're looking at.

10
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,430
So we can use SAT to show other problems

11
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,370
to be NP complete now,

12
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,460
and once we have shown these problems to be NP complete,

13
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,590
we can use them as well to show

14
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,610
again, other problems to be NP complete,

15
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,300
so we are basically building this whole tree of NP complete problems

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,270
using SAT as a c problem

17
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,490
and it will just suffice to show these

18
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,370
reductions here; we do not have to

19
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,080
do the same tedious steps of Boolean formula n coding anymore,

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,240
because we already know SAT to be NP complete now.

21
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,960
So let's take 1 step back now

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,490
with our next quiz.

23
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,910
What happens if you show one NP complete problem

24
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,790
to be solvable in polynomial time?

25
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,630
And by solvable in polynomial time, of course,

26
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,870
I mean on a deterministic RAM.

27
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,770
Would that mean that some problems in an NP

28
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,330
can be solved in polynomial time?

29
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,620
Again, we're talking about a deterministic RAM here.

30
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,880
Would it mean that all NP complete problems

31
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,150
are solvable in polynomial time?

32
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,460
Or would it mean that all problems in NP

33
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,630
are solvable in polynomial time?

34
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,090
And again, more than 1 of these answers here can be correct,

35
00:01:23,090 --> 99:59:59,999
so please check every statement that is correct.
