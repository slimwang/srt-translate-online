1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:01,880
In the following quiz,

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,890
you'll be asked to write your own
function that returns random nouns.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,750
We'll use this in our mad libs generator
to simulate a person playing our game.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,250
Which will make things
a bit more interesting.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,610
Now don't worry,
this isn't as hard as it sounds.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,040
Particularly because we'll be using
a new function called randint

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,730
to help us out.

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,610
Just remember the function
string.replace

9
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,610
from a couple of lessons ago.

10
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,330
We'll see that randint
looks pretty similar.

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,080
Now before we can use randint,

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,280
we're going to have to put this line
of code at the top of our file.

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,790
This might look a bit strange
with words like from an import.

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,110
Essentially, this allows
us to use randint

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,900
since the function isn't
built into Python.

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,450
However, it's not necessary to fully
understand what this line of code means.

17
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,400
To use the randint function itself.

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,300
You'll learn a lot more about what are
called import statements in stage three.

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,470
But for now, let's focus on how
to use the function, randint, so

20
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,000
we can generate random nouns.

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,190
This is the basic structure of randint.

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,400
As you can see, randint takes
in two arguments, low and high.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,030
And will return a number from
the first to the second argument.

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,279
With both arguments
included in that range.

25
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,925
So, if I ran this line of code num
could be the number 1, 2, or 3.

26
00:01:21,925 --> 00:01:27,200
You'll use the randint
function in the following quiz

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,580
to generate a random number
between zero and one.

28
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,060
And depending on the output of that
number you'll return one of two nouns.

29
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,560
Good luck.
