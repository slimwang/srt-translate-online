00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,907
We have x plus 1 equals plus or minus the square root of 13 over 3. Now, you may

2
00:00:03,907 --> 00:00:07,933
we wondering why it doesn't look like I took the positive and negative versions

3
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:11,810
of the square root of the left side of the equation. But with this equation

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:16,890
right here, we're actually covering all of our possible solutions for x. Here's

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,843
why. We know that if we have a square root of a number, and we make that

6
00:00:20,843 --> 00:00:24,878
negative. Then that's just equal to negative 1 times the square root of that

7
00:00:24,878 --> 00:00:29,169
number. The negative version of this square root effects would then be negative

8
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:33,116
1 times that. Which is negative x minus 1. Let's say that we had this in an

9
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,934
equation as well, with the same thing on the right side. They're more

10
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:41,005
effectively taking care of the plus and minus versions of the left root. This is

11
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:45,092
going to give us four different equations, which are these four equations right

12
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:49,253
here. However, we need to notice something special about these equations. If we

13
00:00:49,253 --> 00:00:53,159
take this equation, negative x minus 1 equals negative root 13 over 3, and we

14
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,508
divide both sides by negative 1. We end up with x plus 1 equals the root of 13

15
00:00:57,508 --> 00:01:01,414
over 3, which is just this equation up here. That means that one of our

16
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:05,702
equations in the second pair is the same as an equation in the first pair. Now

17
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:09,866
if we do the same thing for these 2 equations. The 2 we haven't touched on yet.

18
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:13,949
We'd find that they are equivalent as well. So if we take the positive and

19
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:19,019
negative square roots of both sides of the equation, So it saves us some time to

20
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:23,836
only put the plus or minus in front of 1 side of the equation. And just take the

21
00:01:23,836 --> 00:01:27,730
positive square root of the other side. Or the negative 1 if you prefer that.
