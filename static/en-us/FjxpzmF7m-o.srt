1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is a supplementary unit

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
in case you've forgotten how sine and cosine and their friends work.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You may directly skip to the quiz to check your knowledge.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Sine and cosine and their friends are about right triangles.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is a right triangle, a triangle that has a right angle;

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
a and b are the legs of the right triangle;

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
c is the hypotenuse.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And I'm interested in that angle, which I call beta.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Once this angle is specified, the ratio of every 2 of these sides is fixed.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
For instance, b divided by c is fixed once beta is given.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's called the sine of beta.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And a divided by c is given once beta is known. That's the cosine.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If we have a different right triangle, with the same angle beta,

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:11,000
you see, in this case, the leg b shrinks at the same ratio as the leg c shrinks.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So this ratio b over c stays constant.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Same for a divided by c; a shrinks, c shrinks at the same ratio,

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
this ratio, a divided by c stays constant.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's a function of this angle beta alone.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
In daily life, you would specify beta with angular degrees:

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
45°, 90°, 180°.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In mathematics and in most parts of computer science, you do not use angular degrees.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You use radians. The idea is the following:

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You look at the unit circle, a circle of radius 1.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If this is the angle I want to express, 90°.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm not using the number 90°,

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
but I'm giving the length of the part of the circumference that I am cutting off here.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The total circumference would be 2π, a circle of radius 1,

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
so this would be π divided by 2.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And that's the angle in radian.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
90° becomes π divided by 2;

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
3.14 and so on, divided by 2.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
A very ugly number.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If I want to specify 45°, that's of course just half of that number;

34
00:02:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
π divided by 4.
