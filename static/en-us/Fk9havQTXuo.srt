00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,117
>> I know a 5 year old is considered to be a child, and so is a 2 year old. A

2
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:08,667
person who is 16 would be considered a teenager, and people for these last ages

3
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:13,447
would be considered adults. When checking to see if this is a function, I want

4
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:18,324
to make sure that my inputs correspond to exactly 1 output. In each case, I only

5
00:00:18,324 --> 00:00:22,821
have one arrow leaving, or going away, towards the output. So yes, this is a

6
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:27,462
function. And remember, just like last case with Jill and Tim, who's outputs

7
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:31,669
were i, we have 5 and 2, who's outputs were both at child. We can havt two

8
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:36,443
inputs that make the same output, but we can't have two outputs from one input.

9
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:41,672
For the second relation I know the color red can correspond to a strawberry or

10
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:46,642
to a raspberry. Notice this input has 2 different outputs. If I say the word

11
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:51,570
red, I'm not sure what output I'm talking about. I could be talking about a

12
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,670
strawberry or a raspberry. I don't know. So this is definitely not a function.

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,222
It breaks our rule. This input has two outputs. We find the same case to be true

14
00:01:01,222 --> 00:01:05,566
with yellow. It could correspond to a banana or a lemon. If an input has two

15
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:10,136
outputs even once, then it's not a function. So we only need to stop once we see

16
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,373
that the first time.
