1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,270
For a key for the user,
we want something completely unique.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,700
For the same reason that we wanted
a completely unique key for

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,470
shopping lists, and shopping list items.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,380
We also wanted to be something that's
easily accessible from AuthData.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,120
We also want a piece of data that we
can have on hand when the user is

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,950
first created.

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,750
In relation to the keys uniqueness,
two users could have the same full name,

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,050
especially if they have a common
name and we get tons and

9
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,200
tons of users using ShoppingList++.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,960
So, this probably not a good option.

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,870
Now, we've been using push IDs in this
situation, but given that we have

12
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,770
a unique UID and an email, do we really
need to generate a new unique ID?

13
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,530
Not really.

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,310
If we wanted something like that we
could use the already generated UID.

15
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,810
So push ID is a no.

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,540
That leaves us with either using
the user's email or the user's UID.

17
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,250
Now, UIDs are usually the go-to choice.

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,350
They're uniquely generated for
each user of Firebase.

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,820
Now, because it's going to generate
a different UID if a user signs in and

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,100
makes a user with Password/Email
versus with Google,

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,630
the UID is actually not a really
great option for our scenario.

22
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,900
But because the two things that these
accounts share is an email, and

23
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,090
usually an email is only
associated with one person,

24
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,160
email is actually a pretty
good choice for us.

25
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,620
But there is one issue with
using emails as a key.

26
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,110
By nature, emails contain periods.

27
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,210
And periods are actually not
allowed as part of a Firebase key.

28
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,770
So I'll give you some advice about
how to deal with that in the spec

29
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,970
that I'm about to send you.
