00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,606
Now, since I'm super picky, as you know. I really would like our interval width

2
00:00:04,606 --> 00:00:09,540
to be just 1/10 instead of 2/10 like it is right now. So what value of x should

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,601
we check next in our function? Please fill that in here. Once you've figured

4
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:16,940
that out, please fill that value in to these two boxes right here, to show the

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,956
two different possible intervals we would have using that x value. Then pick

6
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:25,319
which region of the graph the zero actually lies in.
