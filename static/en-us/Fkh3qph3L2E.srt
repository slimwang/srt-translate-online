1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,940
Let's add delegation to the record
sounds view controller.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,950
First we have to tell Xcode that our
record sounds view controller conforms

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,390
to the AVAudioRecorder
delegate protocol.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:11,920
That is to say.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,450
we'll implementing a function described
in that delegate protocol, and

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,718
our view controller can act as
the delegate for AVAudioRecorder.

7
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:24,640
And the RecordSoundsViewController.swift
file, go to the class declaration and

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,100
indicate that we conform to
the AV audio recorder delegate,

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,630
by adding it here after
UIViewController.

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,270
A class in Swift can only inherit
from a single superclass, but

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,080
it can conform to as many
protocols as you want.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,410
You just have to list them
here separated by a comma.

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,280
Next we have to tell the a.v.

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,170
audio recorder that the record sound
view controller can act as its delegate.

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,480
In the record audio function we
can set our view controller self

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,610
as a delegate to the a.v.

17
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,410
Audio recorder with this line.

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,250
Scroll down to the bottom of the record
sounds view controller.swift file.

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,110
Because we've already informed Xcode.

20
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,110
That our record sounds view
controller conforms to

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,790
the AVAudioRecorder delegate.

22
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,420
If we start typing.

23
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,670
We can see that Xcode autocomplete
automatically shows us.

24
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,510
The functions available in
the AVAudioRecorder delegate.

25
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,660
Including AudioRecorder
did finish recording.

26
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,850
If you hit the return key, Xcode
will fill this function out for us.

27
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:26,130
This is the function we're going to use
to call the stop recording segue that

28
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,820
we set up earlier, and
move to the audio playback scene.

29
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,350
For now let's just add a print
statement to let us know when

30
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,340
AV audio recorder is finished,
right here where it says code.
