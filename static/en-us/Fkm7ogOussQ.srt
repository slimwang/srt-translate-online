1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:00,910
We reload the map.

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,710
It looks like the circles are placed in reasonably right locations.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,079
We can see the South Korea and Japan World Cup, the South Africa World Cup.

4
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:14,095
A number of World Cups in various countries in South America,

5
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:17,727
a number of World Cups in various European countries and

6
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:20,895
then two World Cups in Mexico and one in the U.S.

7
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:26,170
and good news that no circles were plotted in the middle of the ocean.

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,860
Means that the center pixels that we calculated, are approximately correct and

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,970
what's left to do, is to properly scale the circles, so

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,570
that they correctly represent the attendance.

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,460
So, rather than using a constant value, set the attribute r,

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,360
while passing an accessor function, which in this case will set to

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,210
the aggregate attendance, for a given year of the world cup.

14
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,390
Going back to our map and reloading the page, however, we

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,480
can see that something has gone very, very wrong and the whole screen is black.

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,510
Can you figure out what went wrong with the visualization,

17
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,700
when we tried to set the radius of our circles?
