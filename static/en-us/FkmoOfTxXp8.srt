1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,500
Now I want to talk about
one more representation for

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,620
planning, called situation calculus.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,440
To motivate this, suppose we wanted to
have a goal of moving all the cargo from

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:15,050
airport A to airport B, regardless of
how many pieces of cargo there are.

5
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:19,574
You can't express the notion of all
in propositional languages like

6
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:23,245
classical planning, but
you can in first order logic.

7
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:25,779
There are several ways to use
first order logic for planning.

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,470
The best known is situation calculus.

9
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:30,209
It's not a new kind of logic.

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,520
Rather, it's regular, first order logic,
with a set of conventions for

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,450
how to represent states and actions.

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,890
I'll show you what the conventions are.

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,283
First, actions
are represented as objects,

14
00:00:43,283 --> 00:00:48,219
in first order logic,
normally by functions.

15
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:53,469
So we would have a function,
like the function fly,

16
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:58,250
of a plane and a from airport,
and a to airport.

17
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,439
Which represents an object
which is the action.

18
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:09,864
Then we have situations, and situations
are also objects in the logic.

19
00:01:09,864 --> 00:01:15,519
And they correspond not to states but
rather to paths.

20
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,819
The paths of actions that we
have in state space search.

21
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,370
So if you arrive at what
would be the same world state

22
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,240
by two different sets of actions,

23
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,469
those would be considered two different
situations in situation calculus.

24
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:33,620
We describe situations by objects.

25
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,090
So we usually have a initial situation,
often called s0.

26
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:44,450
And then we have a function
on situations called result.

27
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,900
So the result of a situation object and

28
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,920
an action object is equal
to another situation.

29
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,640
And now instead of describing
the actions that are applicable in

30
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,469
the situation with
the predicate actions of s.

31
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,370
Situation calculus, for some reason,
decided not to do that.

32
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:09,349
And instead we're going to
talk about the actions that

33
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:13,729
are possible in the state, and
we're going to do that with a predicate.

34
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:19,859
If the predicate possible of a and s,
is an action, a, possible in a state.

35
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,020
Now, there's a specific form for
describing there predicates.

36
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:32,670
And in general, it has a form
of some precondition of state s

37
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:38,669
implies, that is possible
to do action a in state s

38
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:43,689
I'll show you the possibility axiom for
the fly action.

39
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:48,120
We would say if there's some p,
which is a plane in state s.

40
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,840
And there's some x,
which is an airport in state x.

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,420
And there's some y which
is also an airport

42
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:04,155
is an state s and
p is at location x in state s,

43
00:03:04,155 --> 00:03:09,115
then that implies that it's possible

44
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:13,150
to apply p from x to y in state s.

45
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,280
And that's known as a possibility
axiom for the action fly.
