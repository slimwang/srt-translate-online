1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Which of the following could be simplified or removed without changing the result]

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[function platos_republic(a,b) {]

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's go through the lines 1 at a time. A times 1.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is the same as A=A because anything times 1 is just itself.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So this assigns the new value of A

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to be equal to the old value of A.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So this is actually equal to just doing nothing.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So I could totally remove this line

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
without changing the result of Plato's Republic.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
B gets B+0. This is the same sort of theory.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This reduces to B gets B

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
because adding 0 to something doesn't change its value.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So I could just drop this statement entirely.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A=A+B. That looks like something important might be going on.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's hold on to that for a bit.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In fact, let's go down here and see.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Eventually we're returning A.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I can't remove this line

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
because we actually need to return A to have the same value.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And if I'm going to return A, then I need to keep this line--

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
A gets A+B--so that I know what the right value of A is supposed to be.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But--and this is the potentially tricky bit--

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I can remove B=B+2.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even though there's no arithmetic simplification that I can perform,

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I just don't need the line!

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
B isn't part of the return value.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No one else can ever see it.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We throw it away after this point.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Formally in computer science we call this "dead code".

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It has no effect on the rest of the program.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So I could drop these 3 lines,

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and all that Plato's Republic is really doing

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
is summing its 2 variables together, returning the result.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Plato's Republic is a dialogue written in about 380 BCE

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
that talks about the definition of justice.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The phrase "who watches the watchers"

37
00:01:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
often comes up in discussions or criticisms of Plato's Republic.
