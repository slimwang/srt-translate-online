00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,346
Let's get back to our more serious example about using exceptions and remember

2
00:00:05,346 --> 00:00:10,017
what we're doing is opening a file to write, writing some things into it.

3
00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:14,528
Catching the IO errors and then we're doing some other things. Which we haven't

4
00:00:14,528 --> 00:00:18,094
done anything other than print now. There's one problem with this code and

5
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:21,275
that's that we're closing the file. You might not notice this when you run it.

6
00:00:21,276 --> 00:00:25,247
But, if we're a responsible programmer, we need to remember to close the files

7
00:00:25,247 --> 00:00:29,352
that we opened. So, let's make that a quiz. Where should we close the file? I've

8
00:00:29,352 --> 00:00:35,918
given you four choices, either within the try, within the except handler, after

9
00:00:35,918 --> 00:00:39,773
the try block, or none of the above really work.
