1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,750
Now that we understand these lines of
code and have practiced typing them,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,450
go ahead and add them to the increment
method within the main activity.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,610
Remember that a common beginner mistake
is to specify the data type again.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,500
You only need to specify the data type
once when you declare the variable.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,010
After that,
you can just use the variable name.

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,260
If we add a breakpoint on Line 25 and
then run the debugger,

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,300
we can check what the quantity
variable value is at each step.

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,140
If I click on the plus button, then
the breakpoint on Line 25 is triggered.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,840
I'll click step over to go
to the next line of code.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,480
Now we see that the quantity variable
has been created with the value of two.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,200
If I click step over again,

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,660
then we see that quantity variable
has been updated to three.

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,760
This is because of the quantity
equals quantity plus one line.

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,720
Then we can hit play
to resume the app and

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,530
we can see the latest quantity value
being shown on this screen here.

16
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,360
Do the same thing in
your version of the app.

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,210
Modify the increment method to
update the quantity variable

18
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,500
using quantity equals quantity plus one.

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,030
Then use a debugger to step through and

20
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,330
verify the quantity variable
value at each step.

21
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,550
After that, feel free to experiment
with different expressions for

22
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,700
updating the quantity variable.

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,090
You could do quantity plus one,
or one plus quantity.

24
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,350
Or you could use the variable name
twice, or as many times as you want, or

25
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,950
you can do other arithmetic operations.

26
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,690
You can run this on your
device to see what happens.

27
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,980
When you're done experimenting, go ahead
and revert back to what you had before,

28
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,040
so that we can continue with the lesson.

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,820
Check these boxes when you're done.
