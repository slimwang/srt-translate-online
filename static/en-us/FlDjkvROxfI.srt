00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,140
Here is another fun quiz to get you

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,880
thinking about hardware, software interaction. And in this

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,940
question, I am asking you, what happens when

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,350
you click the mouse? And I'm giving you

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,250
three choices. One of those is the right

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,020
choice. And the first choice is, the mouse

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,630
click corresponds to specific CPU instructions. The second

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,760
says, the mouse click starts up a specific program

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,160
to read the spatial coordinates of the mouse. And

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,990
the third choice says, the mouse click results in a

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,590
CPU interrupt. As I said, there's exactly one right

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,990
choice, and I want you to pick the right choice.
