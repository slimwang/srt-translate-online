1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,776
As another example where a control and

2
00:00:02,776 --> 00:00:05,660
data plan separation comes in handy, let's look

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,770
at the security of internet backbones. Where filtering

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,310
attack traffic is a regular network management task.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,880
Suppose that an attacker is sending lots

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,270
of traffic towards a victim. In this case

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,760
a measurement system might detect the attack, identify

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,580
the entry point, and a controller such as

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,680
the RCP might install what is called a null route to ensure

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,920
that no more traffic reaches the victim from the attacker. Two

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,450
fundamental challenges with SDN are scalability and

12
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,550
consistency. In an SDN a single control element

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,750
might be responsible for many forwarding elements. So control element might

14
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,520
be responsible for hundreds to thousands

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,960
of switches. Of course, for redundancy and

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,410
reliability, typically we want to replicate the

17
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,060
controller. So while the controller is logically

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,970
centralized, physically there may be many replicas.

19
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,910
And, in such a deployment scenario we

20
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,670
need to ensure that different controller replicas

21
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,450
see the same view of the network

22
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,960
so that they make consistent decisions when they're installing state in the data

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:29,330
plane. A final challenge that's also worth mentioning is security or robustness.

24
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,530
In particular, we want to make sure that the network continues to

25
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,070
function correctly in the event that

26
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,020
a controller replica fails or is compromised.
