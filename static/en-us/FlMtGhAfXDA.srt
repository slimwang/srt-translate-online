The answer is to translate, rotate, and then use the inverse translation. The

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,500
translation moves the model to the origin, where it's now centered. The r matrix

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,333
rotates the model on its base. Finally, the inverse of the translation moves it

4
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:16,224
back to where it was. The key idea here is that the object is first being moved

5
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:20,230
to the origin. Once that's done, we can rotate around its axis with the r

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,782
matrix. At this point, forget about that there's even a rotation matrix. The

7
00:00:23,782 --> 00:00:27,710
model's locations are now rotated. Once that's done, we can move it back to the

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,659
same position as before, with the inverse of the translation.
