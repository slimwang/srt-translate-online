In the star network the description is that there is a center node

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to which all other nodes are connected using the edge.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There are n-1 other nodes if you choose one center, and each is connected

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
to the center node with one edge so there are two n-1 edges and that seems good.
