1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,810
What we have here is somewhat similar to what we did with the circles, for

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,350
each one of our data points.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,130
Since we use this over and over again, in practice, I would most likely abstract

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,480
this IF conditional into some function outside of this block of code.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,630
But, for clarity's sake and understanding, I've written it out, and

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,060
with this legend, these groups we've just created.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,190
I'm going to append a circle for each of the bound datapoints.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,500
Set the y attribute of that circle to be some variable i times 30.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,670
Previously we've only used accessor functions like

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,830
this to access the datum that was bound.

11
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,222
But if we specify in our function, two arguments,

12
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:49,970
(d, i) in this case, we actually get the index of the data point.

13
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,280
In this case, we only have two data points, home team and

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,110
others, so i of zero is going to be home team.

15
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,470
I of one is going to be others.

16
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:04,019
And depending on which position we're at in the array we passed to the data

17
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,580
binding function, we're simply going to increment the y position by 30 pixels.

18
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,820
This might seem silly, for a legend that only has two items in it.

19
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,490
But let's say we had a complex chart that maybe had ten different lines or

20
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,680
types of circles or shapes we've drawn.

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,160
We wouldn't have to want to specify either in the data some value or hard code

22
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:32,530
in the exact pixel every one of those ten lines should show up at in the legend.

23
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,450
For the radius and

24
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,420
the fill, nothing new here, we simple check, is the datum home team,

25
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,830
if it is, we're going to draw it to be the same size as the home team circles.

26
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,400
Radius times multiplier.

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,560
And if it's not the Home Team just draw it the same size as

28
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,270
all the other d circles.

29
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,130
And for the fill, if it's the home team fill it to be red and

30
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,850
otherwise make it blue.

31
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,980
I'm going to comment out this last bit of the legend code that appends text,

32
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,290
save my file and see what shows up on the page.

33
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,730
Refreshing the page.

34
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,420
We have our initial chart and

35
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,590
here we see two circles that seem to be floating in space.

36
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,940
But again we haven't appended the text that corresponds to what each of

37
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,620
these circles represents.

38
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,750
We've only drawn a circle the same size and color as the one we want to label.

39
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,120
So now let's go back to the code and actually add text so that a reader knows

40
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,420
what the small blue circles are and what the larger red circles are.
