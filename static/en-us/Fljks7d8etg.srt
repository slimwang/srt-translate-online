1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,930
Okay, so companies do have privacy
policies that address the various

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,340
things that we discussed.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,770
Well, how well do they do
on this privacy policy?

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,230
We haven't actually talked about
scoring the policy, which we did,

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:19,080
but if they have these policies in
place, how well do they follow them?

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,430
Or do they adhere to these policies
that they declare they're following and

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,640
operate according to the policy
that you had agreed to.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,720
Now you want to do business with them,
you want to have a Facebook account,

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,360
Facebook said you can only do that
if you agree to the privacy policy.

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,450
You gave consent.

11
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,475
Are they going to sort of stay within
the boundaries of that policy, or

12
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:42,810
they are not?

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,110
And there are times when
companies actually don't do that.

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,180
Facebook, in the example that we are
talking about, not only didn't do it,

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,600
the U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner FTC
actually had to go after it for

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,560
a while in the people's privacy policy
in the sense that they were doing things

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,400
that the users have
not given consent to.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,430
So what did they do that was bad
which resulted in the FTC action?

19
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,960
So either they did something
they shouldn't have done, or

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,970
they didn't do something that was
expected by users that they would do.

21
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,530
Well they did a couple of things.

22
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,880
They made information users
had designated as private

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,820
particular with friend's list, they
made it public without user consent.

24
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,970
They also made personal information
available to applications of friends.

25
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:34,070
So the idea here is, friend then
they can access something but

26
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,920
this is personal information that
you had not agreed per the policy.

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,460
The policy you had agree to that was
made available to these applications.

28
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,060
They shared information with advertisers

29
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,300
that it had promised
not to share with them.

30
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,540
The members who collect use and

31
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,650
the next thing was share and
I should know who they're sharing with.

32
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,750
In this case,
they shared it with people.

33
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,540
When they'd promised or told me
that they were not going to share.

34
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,930
And they said certain apps were verified
which were really not verified so

35
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,360
that was misleading of course.

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,270
So these are the kind of things that
they did which caught the attention of

37
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,610
the Federal Trade Commission and
The FTC then went after them saying,

38
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,120
you are violating your user's privacy.

39
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,610
So Facebook then

40
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,000
did things that were inconsistent with
the privacy policy they had advertise.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,930
So we said the FTC took action and

42
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,490
some of the sanctions example to that,
the consequences of this violation for

43
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,910
Facebook are the number of those
that the FTC actually mandated.

44
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:42,820
One is that they had to have a privacy
audit, and that had to be done

45
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,280
periodically, biannually, and this is
going to be done for the next 20 years.

46
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,710
So someone from outside has to come and

47
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,960
do a privacy audit, you're not
going to take their word for it.

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,130
Their Facebook is prohibited from,
told not to do it,

49
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,460
misrepresenting privacy and security
settings that are provided to consumers.

50
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,890
Okay?
If you say something is not public,

51
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,250
it should not be public.

52
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:11,040
You shouldn't make it public without
the user being informed about it and

53
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,575
agreeing to it, and they also
required Facebook to get consent

54
00:03:16,575 --> 00:03:22,140
before sharing any information in a way
that exceeds their privacy settings.

55
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,850
Okay?
So, the consent thing is

56
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,770
big when it comes to privacy.

57
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,320
If you give consent then they can
do whatever you consented to.

58
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,300
But the idea here is that consent,
affirmative express consent

59
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,320
because some default should not be that
we can share without checking with them.

60
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,590
It should be that they should agree to
it expressly, or you can share it if

61
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,930
this is in a way that is not
revealed by their privacy settings.

62
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,330
So these are some examples of
the sanctions that the FTC,

63
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,660
when they dealt with the Facebook
case they had, they came up with.

64
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,780
And that's what was slapped on Facebook.
