1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,750
So computer architecture is about building future

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,210
computers, and let's see how it interacts with

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,780
technology trends. So, progress in computer manufacturing technology

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,508
is very fast. So if we design with

5
00:00:13,508 --> 00:00:16,574
current technology and using the parts we already

6
00:00:16,574 --> 00:00:18,691
have for a computer, by the time we

7
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:21,465
design the new computer, we have an obsolete

8
00:00:21,465 --> 00:00:25,302
new computer. Why? Well because, by the time

9
00:00:25,302 --> 00:00:28,404
we have designed it with current technology and parts,

10
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:31,770
the technology and the pieces for computers have improved,

11
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,014
so what we have is something that is using

12
00:00:34,014 --> 00:00:38,346
obsolete technology and obsolete components. So we must anticipate

13
00:00:38,346 --> 00:00:41,495
future technology and what will be available, and then

14
00:00:41,495 --> 00:00:44,175
when we design computer that way, we get future

15
00:00:44,175 --> 00:00:48,061
computers that actually use the most advanced technology available

16
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:50,950
at that time. But how do we do that?

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:56,070
We must be aware of technology trends. That is, how do we expect technology to

18
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,420
change in the future, and what do we expect to be available in the future?
