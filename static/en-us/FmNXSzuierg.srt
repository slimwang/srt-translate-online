00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:06,180
Model building is a way to understand phenomena that are often complex and

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,710
a result of multiple interactions.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,640
It is seldom possible to to clearly write down mathematical formulas that can

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,500
describe the phenomena at all scales and complexities.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Moreover, many phenomena can be repetitive or

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,360
periodic with a pattern that we can identify.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,280
While other phenomena can be non-periodic, unusual, and anomalous.

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,320
We will in this lesson look at some simple ways we can model phenomena.

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,580
It is often a matter of experimenting with different techniques to

10
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,660
understand what works best.

11
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,630
The goal in this lesson is to get you to start

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,830
thinking iteratively through asking questions and making models.

13
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:58,150
We also want you to start thinking in terms of probabilities.

14
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,340
Given that you have already had some background in machine learning,

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,540
we will choose for an example non-parametric statistical models.

16
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,980
The techniques we illustrate should carry over to parametric models,

17
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,400
mathematical models, and machine learning models.

18
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,860
We invite you to try these other models that we will not have a chance

19
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,910
to explore in this lesson by using the methods that we demonstrate here.

20
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,710
So, follow along.
