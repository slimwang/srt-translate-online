1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:03,138
>> Hey Christian, finished.

2
00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:04,080
>> Indeed.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,495
>> Congratulations. You're at the end of the course.

4
00:00:06,495 --> 00:00:09,880
>> You've now learned a lot of concepts through the last

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,110
three projects, and taken the first steps to being a designer.

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,750
>> So let me do a quick summary of what we've gone over in this course. First

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,710
of all there were six fundamental design principles, and

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,120
that lead. To the gulf of execution, the gulf

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,620
of evaluation, which led to seven questions that

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,460
people ask as they try to use something.

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,620
Those seven questions, the ones that crossed the

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,140
two gulfs, illustrate the important role of designers, which

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,820
is to communicate. Communicate the conceptual model they

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,450
have to the person who's going to use

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,160
the product. How do you do the communication?

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,910
Well it's via the product itself, the system image.

17
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,420
So how do you cross that gap? Well, the tools are very

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,040
simple. It's affordances and signifiers and

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,250
conceptual models, and that's the whole course.

20
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,470
>> Through these three projects, you've learned a lot of techniques that are

21
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,830
really powerful. You've learned to go and observe the world, you've learned to

22
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,010
create invitations such as with the

23
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,710
queue. And with user interface, well, screens

24
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,740
are all around us. So you've

25
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,500
learned some powerful techniques like idea generation,

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,648
rapid prototyping and user evaluation. You can take that, you can get better at

27
00:01:19,648 --> 00:01:23,530
those things, you can learn more, you can build and you can change the world.

28
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,410
>> Hey, Christian.

29
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,190
>> Hey, Don. Oh thank you, you found it.

30
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,770
>> Have a box.

31
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:27,885
>> Mm-hm.

32
00:01:27,885 --> 00:01:28,410
>> Excellent.

33
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,800
>> Congratulations.

34
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,920
>> Hey, congratulations to you, too.

35
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,100
>> I enjoyed making this course.

36
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,940
>> I enjoyed it, too.

37
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,860
>> You know, I hope you enjoyed it just as much as we did.

38
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,370
>> [LAUGH] Is that my gift? You brought it!

39
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,040
>> Well yeah.

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,270
>> [LAUGH] Thank you, now I'm going to find out what it is.

41
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:51,060
Oh you shouldn't have. No seriously you shouldn't have.

42
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,390
>> But I did.

43
00:01:51,390 --> 00:02:00,648
>> It's empty [LAUGH].
