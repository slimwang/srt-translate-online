1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,270
Okay, so that last practice question
actually came in two parts.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,880
The first part was to go into
activity_main.xml and change around

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,770
the code in a very similar way to how
you were changing code in the browser.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,110
The next part was to actually
run this new app on your phone.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,330
So I'm going to go ahead and
do the first part.

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,680
I'll go over here,
inside the res folder, layout folder,

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,463
and then I see activity_main.xml.

8
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:27,200
Double-click to open it up.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,370
Okay, now I'm looking at
a TextView child view

10
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,850
inside of a RelativeLayout parent.

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,410
Now it's the TextView
that I'm interested in.

12
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,944
Okay, so I should ask myself
am I changing something in

13
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:42,150
the RelativeLayout,
in the TextView, or both?

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,605
And the answer is I'm changing
something in the TextView.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,490
Another question is which attribute or
attributes do I need to change?

16
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,874
And to change around
the text of the TextView,

17
00:00:51,874 --> 00:00:54,430
that is the android:text attribute.

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,410
So I'm going to go right here.

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,720
I'm going to delete the current value
but of course leave the quotes, and

20
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,270
then I'm going to type
Happy Birthday Ben!

21
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,198
All right, cool.

22
00:01:07,198 --> 00:01:10,090
So this point, I've done the first
part of what I need to do,

23
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,650
which is change around
the activity_main.xml file.

24
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,790
Now, I need to write it on my phone.

25
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,655
And that was a pretty simple process.

26
00:01:16,655 --> 00:01:19,515
I go up to the top here and

27
00:01:19,515 --> 00:01:22,913
over to the green play button which
will install the app on my phone.

28
00:01:22,913 --> 00:01:26,785
Now press play,
wait about five seconds, and

29
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:29,615
at that point,
this Choose Device window pops up.

30
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:31,365
As I just showed you,
I'm going to select my phone,

31
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:34,215
and then I'm going to hit the OK button.

32
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:37,885
And it's a little bit hard to see, but
Happy Birthday Ben appears on my phone.
