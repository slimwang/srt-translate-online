00:00:00,118 --> 00:00:03,350
How are you doing with all the stuff
we've looked at up to this point?

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,220
You should have a good grasp on how
the components we've looked at so

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,850
far all fit together.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,800
Where the data gets sent and
how the data appears in the template.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,460
Remember don't get overwhelmed with
all of the different parts of angular.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,880
Just like with lego bricks,
each new component is its own unit and

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,980
snaps on to some other component.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,510
As you're working with the new
component just try to mentally

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,090
place it in this map.

10
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,320
Then try and make the connections
between it and the other components.
