1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We're just applying the length function to all these strings

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and friends--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7--has 7 characters in it,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
so we're just going to get a 7.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This approach to defining a list where you use square brackets--

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but instead of explicitly listing the elements list a formula

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that's applied to every element in another list--is called a list comprehension.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We comprehend the new list to be made out of transformations

8
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of the elements in the old one.
