1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,710
Recall that we have actually
talked a lot about Panoramas.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,689
We basically said, if we took a bunch
of pictures, and again, this is

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:12,170
the picture that you've seen many of
times, of Lesko's Sports Stadium.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,050
Each individual picture does
not carry enough detail

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,240
to kind of showcase the space very well.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,850
By combining all of them, we can
actually, now generate a newer image.

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:27,110
In this instance, a Panorama that
actually captures the space very well

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,310
because primarily, it goes beyond
the limitations of a limited

9
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,530
field of view of each and every image,
and generates a larger field of view.

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,931
So, in this case, 7 pictures,

11
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:43,000
which are each about 3 by 2,000
pixels about 7.1 megapixel.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,060
Was used to generate a 31 megapixel
image with a field of view of 151

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:53,190
degrees wide, and of course,
it took a lot more disk space,

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,374
and everything else, but of course,
it shows a lot more detail.

15
00:00:56,575 --> 00:00:59,095
Recall also,
that while we were looking at Panoramas,

16
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:04,045
we learned about how to generate Planar,
Spherical, and Cylindrical Panoramas.

17
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:08,145
Again, took a lot of pictures, stitched
them together to generate a Panorama,

18
00:01:08,145 --> 00:01:11,485
and by now, you know, of course,
how we can do this kind of stuff.

19
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:13,895
Now, we're going to start
taking one step forward, and

20
00:01:13,895 --> 00:01:17,125
try to think about what else can we
do with a bunch of pictures of space?
