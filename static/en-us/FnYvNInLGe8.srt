1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,144
Now you've done this already, remember? When you changed all of the pixels from

2
00:00:03,144 --> 00:00:07,612
an image into the negative. At the time, I gave you the loop structure to do

3
00:00:07,612 --> 00:00:12,906
this, and I told you not to look too closely at it. Now, we're ready to reveal

4
00:00:12,906 --> 00:00:16,862
this mystery. On your left we're going to start this program. We have a full

5
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:19,971
loop. Because we want to iterate over all of the pixels, we'll find out soon

6
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:24,380
enough how many pixels there are. The structure's very similar to the structure

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,142
for working with words. Instead of getting the ith character, we get the ith

8
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:34,438
pixel by getting the color at position i. And we can also set it, presumably

9
00:00:34,438 --> 00:00:40,608
after having changed it in some way. So here's your basic loop. Get the pixel,

10
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:45,682
process it, and put it back. Now, how many pixels do we have? We can ask the

11
00:00:45,682 --> 00:00:50,491
picture, and it's going to tell us the number of pixels. And that is the exact

12
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:55,090
analogue to the length of a string except that you should think of the pixels

13
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:01,170
as being arranged like this. A row of pixels, another row and they all come one

14
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,576
after another. When we ask for them. And eventually we reach all the pixels

15
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:12,402
that way. I starts at zero. It goes up to the total pixel count. Is incremented

16
00:01:12,402 --> 00:01:17,036
at every step. We get the i pixel. And that way we get all of the pixels in the

17
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:22,899
image. In our particular example. We simply compute the negative of the color,

18
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:27,566
and then we can put it back. Finally, we want to load the picture, show it to

19
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:34,394
the user, and then start processing it. Let's run the code. Here is Eliza, all

20
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:40,837
positive. And here she is, sadly negative. As you've seen, it's just as easy to

21
00:01:40,837 --> 00:01:44,360
work with pictures as it is to work with words.
