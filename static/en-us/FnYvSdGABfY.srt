1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,130
So, the first is, we're going to
play either the beeping noise, or

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,560
we're going to play the radio depending
on, I think that we had that setting

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,570
from earlier, from the other
system of which mode we're in.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,270
>> So we have a state machine
indicating whether we're in a mode

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,040
that we expect to hear beeps or
we expect to hear radio.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,399
And depending upon which of
those two states we're in,

7
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:29,484
we would expect to hear different
things coming out of the speaker.

8
00:00:29,484 --> 00:00:30,230
>> Right.

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,150
>> Okay.
What else?

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,236
>> And then we are going to be working
with our two other internal state

11
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:36,000
machines.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,510
The one for starting the snooze
timer that'll run up to ten minutes.

13
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,640
>> But that's only if the user
has hit the snooze button.

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,200
>> That's right.
Okay.

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,300
>> So we don't expect,

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,540
as a response to the times matching-
>> Right, right.

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,740
>> That that one happens.

18
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,510
>> Okay, well then, just that one
system then, of the internal system for

19
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:00,270
our alarm in which,
after an hour, it'll go off.

20
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,190
>> So we have to start
counting that hour up in order

21
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,769
to know when to turn it off.

22
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,070
So to deal with this,
we've invented a new event,

23
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,070
event twenty, when the clock
time reaches the alarm time.

24
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,750
And we need to list as the responses for

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,650
that event what Jared
was just talking about.

26
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,875
>> So while we're on the topic
of setting the internal timers,

27
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,860
we said the snooze one, this won't be
effected unless we're talking about

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,130
the specific event where
we press the snooze button.

29
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,610
If you were to press the snooze button,

30
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,450
will that reset the alarm,
the internal alarm timer, back to zero?

31
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,300
>> So, recall that we have this timer
which is timing up to an hour, for

32
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,910
how long the radio's going to play or
the beeper's going to beep.

33
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:48,350
And Jerod's question is if during that
time the user hits the snooze button to

34
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,969
shut them off,
whether that timer resets.

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,330
I don't personally know, but
that's an excellent question that

36
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,800
the developer would
actually have an answer to.

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,550
My intuitive reaction is that no,
it doesn't reset the timer,

38
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,900
it just allows you to snooze
a little while longer.

39
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,400
>> Okay.
