00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,482
So, notice, this case, we were only able to write an expression. Now, I have the

2
00:00:04,494 --> 00:00:09,131
same problem but if added the sentence, the result is negative 18. Before we

3
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:13,691
knew that the end result would be negative 18, we could only have an expression.

4
00:00:13,792 --> 00:00:18,109
But now that I have this extra piece of information, I can set this equal to

5
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:22,940
negative 18. Now, we have an equation. We have an expression on the left and a

6
00:00:22,952 --> 00:00:27,705
number on the right. Now, you can use this equation to figure out the value of

7
00:00:27,717 --> 00:00:00,000
a. Try and find a and put your answer in the box. Good luck.
