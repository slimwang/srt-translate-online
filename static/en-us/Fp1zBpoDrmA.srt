1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,920
The correct answer is neither.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,000
Remember that for the queuing
implementation to work correctly

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,870
each of the elements of the array
has to be in a different cache line.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,090
So the size of the data structure
depends on the size of the cache line.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:19,209
For example, on my machine,
the cache line is 64 bytes so,

6
00:00:19,209 --> 00:00:23,847
the size of the data structure
will be 32 by 64 byte.

7
00:00:23,847 --> 00:00:26,779
But in practice, there may be other
cache line sizes that are used

8
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:28,390
on the architectures that you use.
