In the last quiz, we got 2 values of x that satisfy this equation, which were

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:08,221
the same as the ones we found through factoring earlier on. It's definitely

3
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:12,316
quicker to factor if you can, but sometimes it's hard to see right away how to

4
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:16,280
factor an expression, so if you don't know how, now you have another way to

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,951
solve for x in situations like this. Let's look at the equation 4x squared minus

6
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:25,194
4x minus 3 equals 0. This is a quadratic formula so we should be able to use the

7
00:00:25,194 --> 00:00:29,427
quadratic formula to solve it, even if there are other methods of doing it. So

8
00:00:29,427 --> 00:00:33,387
what values of a, b and c should we use for this equation, if we are going to

9
00:00:33,387 --> 00:00:34,948
use the quadratic formula?
