1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,600
So now we have a menu application that
is only visible to users logged in with

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,060
their Google accounts.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,170
This adds some security to our website,
but I still see one big problem.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,530
We protected information from
outsiders modifying users' data, but

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,408
what about users modifying
other users' data.

6
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:18,280
In lesson three, you will implement
a local permission system that allows

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,990
each user to have customized
data that only they can modify.
