1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,030
So if this is our population. Where the y-axis is frequency. And the x-axis is

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,895
the engagement ratio. We know that if we picked every possible sample of size 20

3
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:15,770
from this distribution and then we calculated the mean of each sample and then

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,621
plotted the distribution of means. It will be normal. The mean of this

5
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:26,635
distribution should be the population mean, which you calculated to be 77

6
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:32,164
1000ths. And the standard deviation of this distribution is the population

7
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:37,540
standard deviation divided by the sample size, which is 0.107 divided by the

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:44,204
square root of 20. And if we round to the nearest thousandth, we get 24 1000ths.

9
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:49,237
So this is a standard error. When we found that, that the mean engagement ratio

10
00:00:49,237 --> 00:00:54,631
of our sample of size 20 was 0.13, we can compare it on this distribution, in

11
00:00:54,631 --> 00:01:01,588
terms of standard error. We want to know how many standard errors 0.13 is from

12
00:01:01,588 --> 00:01:02,466
the mean.
