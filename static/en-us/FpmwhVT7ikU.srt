00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And now, let me play a trick on you. I want to take A-B. So I'm subtracting A from B.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Think of it as playing golf all the way over,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
picking up the ball, and playing the ball back to where you started.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What do you think the µ‘ will be and what do you think the σ‘² will be?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm appealing to intuition here.
