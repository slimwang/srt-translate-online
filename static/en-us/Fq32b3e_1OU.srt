00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,900
By now you've been using Git to keep
track of the changes in your code.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,870
You've been pushing it to GitHub and

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,675
have a nice timeline of
your coding journey.

4
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:09,223
[SOUND] Woah, Walter!

5
00:00:09,223 --> 00:00:12,210
Looks like your head's floating
in space in a Git timeline.

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,210
Don't worry.
You're going to be moving forward,

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,180
making commits and sometimes backwards,
if you make mistakes.

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,380
You'll also be branching out, and
merging when the code is ready.

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,570
We'll make sure you
don't lose your head.

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,580
The content in this lesson will also
help you with your Git workflow by

11
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,500
covering some of Git's best practices
in the next project and beyond.

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,920
If you're ready to Git
started let's Git to it.
