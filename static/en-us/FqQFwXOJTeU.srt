1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Dave:] I'm here with Jim Fruchterman who is the director of Benetech.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Tell us about what Benetech does.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[Jim:] Benetech is Silicon Valley's non-profit technology company,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and we exist to combat market failure.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Basically, when something doesn't make enough money but does a lot of social good,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
we want to develop software that delivers solutions for that social problem.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
[Dave:] What kinds of things do you actually build?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
[Jim:] We write software in three different major areas.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The first one is education, especially for kids with disabilities.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Like we run the largest library for the print disabled, the blind, in the world online.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We also write software for the human rights movement, whether you're a grassroots group

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
or a truth commission or a war crimes tribunal.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Our third area is the environment.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We write project management software for environmentalists that are running campaigns

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
or managing programs on the ground to actually have the same kind of tools

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
you would have in a for-profit but because you're in the environment now you've got one.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
[Dave:] And heard you're starting a new project for coding for social good.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
[Jim:] Yeah, it's in a pilot phase right now.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's called "Social Coding for Good," and you can kind of think of it as an

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
online matching site for geeks that want to do social good.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You tell us your passion, your technical skill, and your time availability,

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and we'll hopefully match you up with a project like Wikimedia

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
or the Guardian Project helping human rights groups

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
or whatever other sort of project that matches up with your goals.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's just in the pilot phase, but we're hoping that in the next year it goes to scale

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
so that geeks all over the world that want to do social good can get a chance

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
to go to a place like GitHub, do some volunteering, and get some good cred

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
for having done something socially good.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
[Dave:] How much experience would students need to have to be able to start doing this?

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
[Jim:] Well, I think that people in different levels of the professional area

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
of software development can actually help.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I think our initial target audience is to work on people who are in the profession,

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
people who are working for high-tech companies or software developers,

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
but the human rights, the environment, and the education need people at

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
all sorts of different levels.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It could be characterizing a bug or writing some documentation,

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and our goal, of course, is people can increase and improve their skills

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
by doing volunteering for social good, and then hopefully that leads to a job

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
either doing social good or maybe a regular job.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
[Dave:] It sounds like you found ways to do lots of really beneficial things with technology.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Can you tell us what are the social responsibilities that someone who gets power

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
because they learned about technology should have?

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
[Jim:] You know, I think that being educated in a profession like software development

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
you have a responsibility to give back to society.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Many people do that by actually getting a job and creating products that have value.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The thing I want to talk to engineers is as you go out there and you see problems

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
that are important to society and they can take advantage or your skills,

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
don't ignore them just because they don't make a lot of money.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I think that there are ways to make a living or volunteer to actual help these issues,

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and I think that that's really an area of terrific satisfaction as a toolmaker

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
when you see the great things that people do with your tools.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Solve bit social problems and actually find a way to change the world for the better,

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
not just for more money.
