00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,723
If we subtract 2x from both sides and 6 from both sides, then we'll have 0 on

2
00:00:04,723 --> 00:00:11,045
the left, and x squared minus 4x minus 5 on the right. Great work if you found

3
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:14,595
this expression. Now, this might look a little funny to you, but I just

4
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:20,648
combined the subtraction in one step. I subtracted 2x and I subtracted 6. Keep

5
00:00:20,648 --> 00:00:24,011
in mind that we can do this so long as we perform the same operation on the

6
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:26,619
left as we do on the right.
