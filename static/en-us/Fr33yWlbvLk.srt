1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
And the answer is relatively easy.

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,075
3 + 9 + 9 + 3 = 24

3
00:00:05,075 --> 00:00:08,509
divided by m = 4 is 6

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,021
so the mean value is 6

5
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:14,915
subtracting the mean from the data gives us -3, 3, 3, and -3

6
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:18,819
squaring those gives us 9, 9, 9, 9

7
00:00:18,819 --> 99:59:59,999
and the mean of 4 nines equals 9.
