00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,500
This quiz is about computational
speed limits like this one, or

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,930
if you prefer metric distances,
this one.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,920
Start by considering a 2-D
mesh of physical processors.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,870
You can, if you wish, imagine that this
mesh is actually a many core processor

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,210
that fits on a physical
die of a certain size.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,640
Let's say that size is L by L.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,770
In this mesh every interior
point is connected to its

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,410
eight nearest neighbors.

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,550
This means each processing unit can
communicate along diagonal routes.

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,820
Now consider a single
operation defined as follows,

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,660
it starts at the processing
unit at the center.

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,180
The operation then travels as a signal
to a unit at one of the corners.

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,030
It then turns around,
making a round trip back to the center.

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,370
Let's say you want to be able to do say,

15
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,830
3 trillion of these operations
per second sequentially.

16
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,860
So you want to do this
round trip operation,

17
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,350
center to corner to center,
center to corner to center.

18
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,610
And then do that 3
trillion times per second.

19
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,750
And by way of reminder,
a trillion is 10 to the 12th.

20
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,370
Here is my question.

21
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,590
If a signal travels at
the speed of light,

22
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,060
what is the maximum physical
dimension of this mesh?

23
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,060
In other words,
what's the largest l can be?

24
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,530
I want you to give your answer in
micrometers, or a micron, for short.

25
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,650
And since we're doing a back
of the envelope exercise,

26
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,810
you can round your answer
to one significant figure.

27
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,810
A handy fact is that the speed of light
is about 300 million meters per second.
