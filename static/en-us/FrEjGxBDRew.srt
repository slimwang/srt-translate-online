1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,650
In the evolution of camera, couple of other things have happened.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,860
One, I believe, is our relationship on how we use a camera.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,415
In the old days, this is the kind of, a very formal, you set up a camera and

4
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:17,120
you basically use it for a few pictures.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,170
This kind of resulted in more of this stand up kind of relationship where

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,110
you began.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,320
Spent a lot of time focusing and doing other types of things.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,970
Too much more now, a standoffish, casual photography.

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,810
So again, formal to casual has been one of

10
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,640
the trends that's happened with photography.

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,350
Of course, we have lots of mobile cellphone cameras in everybody's hands.

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,750
Wearable cameras are now showing us, of course,

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,160
these are types of extreme sports cameras, people doing skiing, diving, and

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,390
even under water snorkeling and scuba diving with cameras like this and

15
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,430
giving you a very interesting experential sense of what's going on.

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,030
Of course I can't not mention my friend and colleague Thad Starner,

17
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,280
who worked with Google to kind of help create this Google Glass,

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,970
which is again a wearable camera widely being used for capturing experiences.

19
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,950
But, just to kind of showcase this could go completely in the, you know,

20
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,700
interesting directions, I'll let you think good or bad, but more and more

21
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,290
cameras are going to be worn by us on our bodies, for capturing experiences.

22
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,440
But this is where cameras are getting cheaper,

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,210
smaller, and getting much more wider use.

24
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,750
I love to share this example.

25
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,280
This is from the movie, Her and in fact, in this movie the character played

26
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,520
by Joaquin Phoenix always took a camera with him.

27
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,190
And in fact here you see the camera in his pocket and

28
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,560
it basically could see everything around him.

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,840
And of course they communicated and

30
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,220
shared experiences through the camera and of course what he saw.

31
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,800
This is an interesting future.

32
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,590
Again as I said we'll see if we get there or

33
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,500
not but, again, cameras are playing a role in these types of things.

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,600
And at least there's at least been signs given as to what could happen.
