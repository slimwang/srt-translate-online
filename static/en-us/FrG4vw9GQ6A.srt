00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,292
We've worked really hard to come up with this brand new equation, so let's use

2
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:09,260
it. Grant has actually made more than $10,000, since cleaning glasses has been

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:16,562
so profitable. He wants to invest more money, $20,000 in another account at a

4
00:00:16,562 --> 00:00:22,900
4% annual interest rate for 5 years. Should he have the money compounded

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:28,329
quarterly which is four times a year or monthly? Well, let's help him figure

6
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:34,394
that out. How much money will he end up with after 5 years in either case? This

7
00:00:34,394 --> 00:00:39,927
is the perfect chance to use our new equation. Please round to two decimal

8
00:00:39,927 --> 00:00:41,060
places.
