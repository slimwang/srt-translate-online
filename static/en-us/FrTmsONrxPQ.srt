00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,328
The slope of this line right here is negative. Notice that slope as we defined

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,577
it, is the increase in y divided by the increase in x. But as x increases over

3
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:15,930
here on our graph, y actually steps downward. We can't draw a triangle like we

4
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:20,560
did before, or rather, we can draw a triangle, just a different triangle. We

5
00:00:20,572 --> 00:00:24,975
have to notice that as we walk over to the right, we walk down instead of up.

6
00:00:25,077 --> 00:00:28,435
This means that our slope is negative instead of positive.
