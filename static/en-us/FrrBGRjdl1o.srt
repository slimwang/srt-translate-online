00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,170
So here are some of the issues that arise when we

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,700
try to accomplish the first step in OOA.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,582
As Jared mentioned, some of the words are duplicated.

4
00:00:11,582 --> 00:00:13,290
You know, we'll try to condense those and

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,630
just have one copy of each of the words.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,949
Some words share the same stem, for example, pile and piles.

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,630
And some words are, are close to each other and

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,210
really share the same underlying concept like leaf and leaves.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,070
And in these cases we're going to do what's called stemming.

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,690
Stemming removes the prefixes and the post fixes, the suffixes to the words,

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,620
and just uses the root word as the corresponding candidate and class.

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,860
That leaves us with a question that you, you, you indicated both counter and

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,380
count, okay?

14
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,990
In this case, we're going to use our kind of discretion and say, let's for the,

15
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,580
the moment treat those as separate classes, even though by getting rid of the,

16
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,100
the suffix on counter, we get the same word as count.
