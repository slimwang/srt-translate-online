1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,160
The bottom level is easy to compute.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,876
It's just the number of moves
available to play a row.

3
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:08,660
Then the second level from
the bottom is a max level.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,199
So, we take the max at each branch here.

5
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,603
Then the top level of the subtree is
the min level and we end up with a 2.
