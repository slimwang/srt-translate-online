1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,994
When we carry out this long division, what we end up with up here, is x squared

2
00:00:03,994 --> 00:00:09,930
minus 3 x minus 2. And note that down here, in our remainder spot, we have a 4

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,970
this time instead of a 0. This is proof that x minus 1 is not a factor of this

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,510
polynomial. Since we have a 4 left over, this doesn't go into our original

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,453
expression evenly.
