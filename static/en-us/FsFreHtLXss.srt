1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,520
What's kind of cool about mean-shift,
a bunch of things,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,986
is under some reasonable
assumptions like the,

3
00:00:04,986 --> 00:00:08,850
the shape of the thing that you put
down which is a kernel kind of thing,

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,090
you can prove that, in most
circumstances, this thing will converge.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,580
So, it'll actually find those modes.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,210
And that's really cool.

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,160
So what does this have to do
with tracking, you might ask.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,238
>> What does this have
to do with tracking?

9
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:28,240
>> So basically,
mean-shift tracking is, instead of just

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,070
tracking the mean of a distribution,
we're going to try to track,

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,510
essentially, a, something about
a distribution of a region.

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,850
I'll, I'll make that clear.

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,200
But our methodology is
pretty similar to before.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,090
We have some position that
we start with, right?

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,190
And here, by the way, our initial
model is not just a location.

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,500
But it's this region and
the size of that region.

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,140
And what we have to do is we search.

18
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,140
We're going to search in
a neighborhood in the next frame for

19
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,940
that same description.

20
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,690
Okay?
And when we do the search,

21
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,150
we're going to move around at x y.

22
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,520
We also might do things like
change the scale, all right?

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,500
And what we want to do is, we want to
find the lo, the new location,

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,370
maybe scale,
maybe some other ch, change.

25
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,710
Maybe an orientation thing.

26
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,740
That maximizes some similarity function.

27
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,310
All right?
And then we just, iterate.

28
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,500
We connect the dots.

29
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,380
And we repeat the process and we get
this beautiful animation that says,

30
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,820
okay, the new maximum becomes
the start for the next frame.
