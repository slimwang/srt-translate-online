1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,913
So far, I've only kind of looked at grey-scale images.

2
00:00:03,913 --> 00:00:06,328
Let's step back and now actually go back to color images.

3
00:00:06,328 --> 00:00:09,013
So, this is the original color image, the mandrill image,

4
00:00:09,013 --> 00:00:10,391
that we've looked at before.

5
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:12,712
What we want to do now is start thinking about is,

6
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:14,960
what makes this a color image?

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,750
Well, basically, what we need to now start thinking about is,

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,741
what is a red channel?

9
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:20,388
What is a green channel and a blue channel?

10
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:22,279
In essence, I'm going to claim this,

11
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,590
this image is actually divided into, three different color channels.

12
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,430
So now I'm going to slowly and

13
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,870
slowly show you the three different channels, starting with the blue channel.

14
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,570
Of course, each color image is of three channels with their own intensities.

15
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,950
This is the blue channel.

16
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,600
If you notice here the regions in this image which has a lot more blue, is,

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,770
of course, more white because that's where the maximum intensity is.

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,240
In the green case, if you notice, these parts have a lot more white colors.

19
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,610
And in the case of red channel, this part, of course, is the brightest.

20
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,090
So, in essence, these are the three different channels, and

21
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,700
these merge together.

22
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,940
Blended together create our color image.

23
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,160
So this now makes us want to add one aspect

24
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,260
addition to the resolution of the image.

25
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,430
That is we have a width, we have a height and

26
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,800
of course we have number of channels.

27
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:20,023
So in essence if this was a 512 by 512 image, we would also have three channels.

28
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,800
And therefore, actually, our resolution would be 512 by 512 times three.

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,300
And following from that, each pixel therefore has three intensities.

30
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,350
Each and every pixel in this color image has a red color value,

31
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,490
a green value and a blue value, and composite of this gives us a color image.

32
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,480
I'll recall from last time that each grey scale image is basically represented

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,350
by a, a range of grey values from 0 to 255.

34
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:53,449
That is also true for each and everyone of the color channels, 0 to 255.

35
00:01:53,449 --> 00:01:57,382
And remembering that basically we said that we needed eight pixel,

36
00:01:57,382 --> 00:01:58,970
eight bit image.

37
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,980
To be able to get a range from zero to 255, because that's what we needed.

38
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,720
Well, now, if I wanted to have three of them,

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,288
basically you can imagine the range is going to be 24 bits to

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,240
be able to get a much bigger range than we have right now.

41
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,120
And that's what basically we mean by an eight-bit grayscale image or

42
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,880
a 24-bit color image.
