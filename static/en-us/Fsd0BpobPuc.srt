1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:06,205
So, how did you do? The correct answer is 3 times 2x minus y times 3x minus 5.

2
00:00:06,205 --> 00:00:10,050
Let's see how we got that answer. Whenever I see a four term polynomial, I know

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,560
I want to use factoring by grouping. But remember the first step in any

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,582
factoring problem is to look for a GCF. In this case, when I look at the four

5
00:00:19,582 --> 00:00:24,952
terms, I know that it has a GCF of 3. So I'm going to factor out the GCF from

6
00:00:24,952 --> 00:00:30,236
these four terms. So, when I factor out a 3, I'm left with 6x squared minus 3xy

7
00:00:30,236 --> 00:00:34,980
minus 10x plus 5y. Now, I'm going to try to factor out what's left inside the

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,476
parentheses. When I factor by grouping, I want to find the GCF of the first 2

9
00:00:40,476 --> 00:00:46,385
terms, which is 6x squared minus 3xy. The GCF of these first 2 terms is 3x. When

10
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:54,850
I factor a 3x out, I'm left with 2x. 3x times 2x is 6x squared minus y. 3x times

11
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:00,800
negative y gives me negative 3xy. The next thing I want to do is factor out the

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,060
GCF of the second 2 terms. Now, you have to be careful here. We know we want the

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,171
second binomial to be 2x minus y over here. But right now, we have negative 10x

14
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:16,318
plus y. This is one of the cases we need to factor out the negative. The GCF of

15
00:01:16,318 --> 00:01:22,676
10x and 5y is going to be negative 5. The reason I factor out the negative is

16
00:01:22,676 --> 00:01:30,334
because I want positive 2x. Negative 5 times 2x gives me negative 10x and

17
00:01:30,334 --> 00:01:38,363
negative 5 times negative y gives me 5y. Because negative 5 times 2x is negative

18
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:44,096
10x. And negative 5 times negative y gives me positive 5y. My next step is to

19
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:51,245
factor out the GCF of the two terms inside the parentheses. Remember to carry

20
00:01:51,245 --> 00:02:00,390
along the three, and I'm left with 2x minus y, times 3x minus 5. And these

21
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,789
second pair of parentheses is redundant. So I can just write 3 times 2x minus y

22
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:12,568
times 3x minus 5. Did you get that? Well done. Let's learn more about factoring.
