00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,430
We've come to the end of this course.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,836
And this is a great opportunity for

3
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:08,220
us to pause and reflect on the things that we've learned together.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,120
Take a moment to think about what you've learned in this course and

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,480
write it down.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,040
You can either draw an image using pen and paper, then take a picture of it.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,560
And share it with us, using Twitter, LinkedIn, or Facebook.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,720
Or if you want to keep your work private,

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,590
you can write down everything that you've learned in this text box.
