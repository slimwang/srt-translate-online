1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Same situation as before.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We'd like to go from here to here.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We have a 3-dimensional state space.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The goal is worth 100.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
A straight motion costs -1.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Turning on the spot clockwise costs -10,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but turning counterclockwise,

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which is "C-CW," costs us 0.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What is now the value of the start state?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please put your answer in here.
