Now that we've dealt with our money from
wipers, let's move on to figure out how

2
00:00:03,955 --> 00:00:07,812
much money Grant's going to make, from
selling this first batch of nozzles.

3
00:00:07,812 --> 00:00:13,488
Remember that, 11 people, each asked him
for two nozzles. Also, we decided that n

4
00:00:13,488 --> 00:00:18,139
is equal to the price per nozzle. This is
for one nozzle, not for two nozzles. So,

5
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:23,044
which of these choices do you think is
equal to the money he is going to earn

6
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:25,460
from these nozzle sale so far?
