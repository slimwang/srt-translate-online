1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,578
We don't know the first amount, so that's x. And we don't know the second

2
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:09,403
amount, so that's y. If we add the two amounts together, we get a total amount

3
00:00:09,403 --> 00:00:14,127
of $25,000, just like in our problem. For our second equation, we know our

4
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:18,796
interest rate for this first amount was 7%. So I have 0.07, 7 hundredths times

5
00:00:18,796 --> 00:00:23,701
x. Our second amount gained 8% interest. So we have 8 hundredths times y, and

6
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:28,447
our total interest was 1900, that was written in our problem. If you're able to

7
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:33,359
write both of these equations that's exceptional. This is strong algebraic

8
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:34,129
reasoning.
