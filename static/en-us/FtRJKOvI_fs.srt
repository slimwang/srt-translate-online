1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,510
>> Alright, let's do a little quiz.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:01,966
>> Okay.

3
00:00:01,966 --> 00:00:04,140
>> To help us to kind of, make sense of the

4
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,466
equations in the Q learning equation by looking at a simpler case.

5
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:11,090
So let's imagine that we got some variable V and some

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,680
sequencing value X and a sequence of learning rates, alpha sub t.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,602
So we're going to draw a series of these X values and

8
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:20,830
use them to update the V values and the learning rate is

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,340
changing over time and the learning rate is going to have,

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,260
first of all X is going to be drawn X sub T. Is

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,960
going to be drawn from some, the distribution of some random variable, big X.

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,801
>> Mm-hm.

13
00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:31,830
>> And the learning rates are going to

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,730
satisfy two properties. One is that the

15
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,290
sum of the learning rates, summed up to infinity. But, the sum of the squares

16
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,480
of the learning rate, as we go to infinity, sums up to something less than

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,360
infinity. So can, can you think of

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,550
a learning rate sequence that has that property?

19
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,950
>> So, the one that I remember is alpha sub t equals one over t.

20
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,540
>> Good. So in

21
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,280
fact these's a whole range of possible powers

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,910
of t that work here, but one over t

23
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,920
is a good one. Why is this, why does it satisfy the properties? Well, if you sum

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,050
up the values up to sum value t, sum up the one over i values, it actually

25
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,360
acts like the natural logarithm. And so, as

26
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,200
t goes to infinity, the sum goes to infinity.

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,910
>> But logarithmically.

28
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,470
>> Which is still you know, infinity.

29
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,120
>> Yeah.

30
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,750
>> But if you look at the sums of the squares,

31
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,020
that's actually a well known problem called the I think,

32
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,370
the Basil problem, the Basil problem? And it turns out

33
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,550
to actually be pie squared over six which is kind of

34
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,770
crazy. But there it is which is a finite value.

35
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,955
>> That's intuitively obvious even to the most casual observer.

36
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:34,240
>> No I really, this, it's, it's, it's whacky. It was

37
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,880
an open problem for a long time and then it was

38
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,201
finally solved. And it's like, yeah sure pi squared over six.

39
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:39,980
Like where's the pi in here? There's no pi in here.

40
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,900
>> Mm, I didn't find pi anywhere.

41
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,640
>> [LAUGH] That's neither here nor there. The whole, the point

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,790
is there's, there's a bunch of sequences of learning rates that satisfy

43
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,230
this property, and we're going to imagine that we have a sequence

44
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,725
of learning rates that satisfies this property. We're going to be updating V

45
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:57,390
sub-t, with a series of X values drawn from, from distribution

46
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,660
big X, and what I'm asking is, what do you think this

47
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,390
converges to? Do you think it converges to the expected value

48
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,960
of X? Do you think maybe it just doesn't converge at all?

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,270
Do you think it converges to the variance of

50
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,190
X? Of, of the random variable X? Or does it

51
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,170
converge to infinity, it just keeps growing without bound?

52
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,100
All right. Does that seem like a well formed question?

53
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,320
>> sure.

54
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,120
>> All right. So let's give you a chance to think about it.

55
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,620
>> Okay.
