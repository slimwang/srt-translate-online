00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,705
Here were the two original inequalities and these were the solutions, x less

2
00:00:04,717 --> 00:00:09,309
than negative 3 or x less than or equal to negative 4. Let's compare the two

3
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:13,813
number lines. It's harder to see the number lines compared horizontally, so

4
00:00:13,825 --> 00:00:18,325
let's stack them on top of each other. When looking at the number lines, we

5
00:00:18,337 --> 00:00:23,211
values of x that satisfy this inequality or this inequality. So, we want all of

6
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:27,405
these values. Any value within this region or any value within this region

7
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:31,785
satisfies one of the conditions. Notice that the top number line is contained

8
00:00:31,797 --> 00:00:36,190
entirely within the second one. That means, we only need the solutions that are

9
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:40,992
less than negative 3. Any value that's less than negative 3 will work in this

10
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:45,037
first inequality and any value less than negative 4 will work in this

11
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:50,954
inequality. That's why we want this region. We want these values or these

12
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:55,967
values, so we show all these values on one number line. This is our solution

13
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:00,955
set. Any value of x for negative infinity up to negative 3 but not including

14
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:06,109
negative 3 will work. x needs to be less than negative 3. In interval notation,

15
00:01:06,214 --> 00:01:10,757
we list it like this. This is a really tough problem. So, if you got the one

16
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:11,877
right, great work.
