00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,656
At the same time as Gloria has been learning about exponential growth to help

2
00:00:03,656 --> 00:00:07,418
her pandas out, Grant has also been trying to figure out exponential functions

3
00:00:07,418 --> 00:00:13,575
to help deal with his company's investments in different bank accounts. Suppose

4
00:00:13,575 --> 00:00:18,225
that Grant wants to invest $10,000 and the bank say, you can get 3% interest

5
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:25,245
per year compounded yearly. Grant feels confused. The bank explains that

6
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:29,275
compounded annually means that once a year the total amount of money in the

7
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:35,033
account is calculated. And then 3% of that amount is added on top of the total

8
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:39,930
in-, interest. Let's start out by just calculating this for the first three

9
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,726
years that Grant has the account. I've already written in all the information

10
00:00:44,726 --> 00:00:49,820
that we have and really it's all that we need to figure out the rest of this.

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,968
You know that he starts out with $10,000 at the beginning of the first year

12
00:00:53,968 --> 00:01:00,276
that he invests. Our interest rate is 3%. So that means that 0.03 times this

13
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:07,640
amount will be added to the account at the end of the year. 0.03 times $10,000

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:15,910
is 300. 10,000 plus 300 makes 10,300. Since this is the amount that's present

15
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,444
at the end of year 1, it's the amount that's present at the beginning of year

16
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:27,497
2. So year 2 starts off with 10300. What I would like you to do right now is to

17
00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:32,140
fill in the missing information in each of these cells. How much interest will

18
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,989
he earn in the second year? And how much will that give him at the end of year

19
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:41,672
2? Use that as the start of year 3 and then calculate the new amount of

20
00:01:41,672 --> 00:01:44,960
interest and then the new total.
