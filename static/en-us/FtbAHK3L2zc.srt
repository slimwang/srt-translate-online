00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,437
Let me show you, how we're going to be using Developer tools

2
00:00:02,437 --> 00:00:04,870
in this course. I'm running Chrome Canary. And I have my

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,800
phone connected. Which I have just on the side here with

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,330
me. You can see that I have the udacity side open. Let's

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,390
inspect that. With the Developers tool's open, let's navigate to the

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,090
Timeline [UNKNOWN]. This is where we're going to be spending most of our

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,490
time, in this course. Next, you can actually enable, the Screencast

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,410
feature, if you have your phone connected. So let's click, on that.

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,050
And you can see a preview of. What's actually

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,070
on my screen. And as you can see, it's the

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,242
same picture. To record a trace, we're just going to

12
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:37,880
hit reload and, wait for Chrome to capture the full

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,340
trace. Once the page is done, we have the

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,500
full trace here. And you can extend and view all

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,320
of the activity, here as well. This is the view

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,320
that we're going to be using for, most of the course.

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,776
>> Wow, that's pretty awesome.

18
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:52,670
But what if I don't have a phone handy?

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,630
>> I definitely recommend using Mobile Debugging if you

20
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,550
have a phone handy. But if you don't, you

21
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,060
can record the same Timeline data, directly on your

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,879
computer. Check the instructor notes, for a quick how-to.
