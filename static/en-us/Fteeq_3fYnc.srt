00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,330
Let's say I give you a memory
chip whose area is the same as

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,380
the cross section of a human hair?

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,350
That's about 4900 squared microns.

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,470
In this case, I'm not very cool, so
my hair, like this chip, is square.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,379
Now suppose you wanted this memory
chip to store one Terabyte of data.

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,940
In this case, let's take a Terabyte
to P 10 to the 12th bytes.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,430
Here's my question.

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,080
What is the area occupied
by a single bit?

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,620
Note that I'm looking for
the area of a bit as opposed to a byte.

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,080
Here's a little bit of space for
your answer.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,840
Type your answer here in units
of squared microns per bit.
