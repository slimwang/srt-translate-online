00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,001
So back in the book list demo I have my list of books to read and here I want

2
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:09,423
to replace the Eyre Affair with the sequel. When I want to replace an element I

3
00:00:09,423 --> 00:00:14,230
use the set method and the Eyre Affair is element zero. So now that reference

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,826
at element zero will be a reference to Lost in a Good Book instead of the Eyre

5
00:00:17,826 --> 00:00:23,303
Affair and you can see this by running the method again. Now it starts with

6
00:00:23,303 --> 00:00:24,730
Lost in a Good Book.
