1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,310
So, this is what I've done.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:06,930
You'll notice here that I had to add a new div with a container class.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,100
This makes sure that the margins on the side of the screen look good.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,130
Then, inside of the container we have our row.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,290
And then finally the columns inside the row.

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,780
Scrolling down, we can see that each row has a total of 12 columns.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,260
So for instance this row, with featured work, has column medium 12,

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,660
while the row below featured work contains two columns,

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,330
each one a class column medium 6.

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,950
Notice how we have multiple rows on the page.

11
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,820
For instance, we have a row here for featured work, and inside the row we have

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,340
column medium 12 because featured works takes up the entire width of the screen.

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,990
However, in the row that contains our two samples of work,

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,300
we have two columns, each of size six.

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,500
Six plus six is 12.

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,380
So, these two take up the entire row.

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,900
Coming back to our question,

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,940
we did need to add a container div outside of our rows, so that one is true.

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,230
We didn't need to add any new divs to organize columns in rows.

20
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,950
That was already done for us.

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,450
Inside of our rows, we did need to add new divs with columns to organize our

22
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,340
content, so this last one is also true.

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,430
