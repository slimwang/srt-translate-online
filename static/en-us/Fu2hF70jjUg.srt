Let's wrap up this unit on rational expressions by looking at variation.

2
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:08,616
Variation is a concept about relating two or more amounts. For example, if you

3
00:00:08,616 --> 00:00:12,642
have an hourly wage at a job we can relate the number of hours you work to the

4
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:17,360
amount of money you earn from that job. Let's say your current wage is $10 an

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,065
hour and if you work 40 hours in a week, you can make $400. We get this simply

6
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:25,910
by multiplying the number of hours we worked. By our current wage. And it turns

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,612
out there's a unique relationship between the wage and our hours. So what do you

8
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:35,270
think would happen if you worked more hours? Would you make more money, less

9
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,943
money, or the same amount?
