00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,640
Today, we'll talk about another knowledge representation called scripts.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,040
Scripts allow us to make sense of discourses and stories and

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,280
scenes. Scripts are the culmination of of frames and understanding and

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,650
common sense reasoning these last few lessons. We'll take what we learned about

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,530
frames and understanding and common sense reasoning to build superior scripts.

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,010
We'll start by defining scripts, then we'll talk about the form and

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,760
the content of scripts. Then we'll discuss how we can use scripts to

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,840
generate expectations about discourses and

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,490
stories that help us make sense of the world around us. Finally, we'll

10
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,930
talk about the hierarchical nature of scripts. I think you'll enjoy this lesson.
