1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,440
Okay, so the answer we're looking for

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:06,670
here is setRequiresCharging with
true passed in as a parameter.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,650
So hopefully you were able to find
your way to the JobInfo.Builder

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,717
documentation.

5
00:00:10,717 --> 00:00:13,590
And then fortunately when you
reviewed the public methods,

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,300
you'd be pleased to find this
function called setRequiresCharging.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,650
And it specifically addresses
what we want it to do.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,960
Which is to specify that to run this
job, the device needs to be plugged in.
