00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,560
Now that we've completed making
our prototype we'll want to gather

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,750
feedback using Envision.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,720
There are two methods for
gathering feedback on your designs.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,002
First I previously
mentioned the share link.

5
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:16,660
Share links are a great way to
gather feedback on your project.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,070
You can also generate specific share
links that only display specific screens

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,070
in your project if your trying
to obtain targeted feedback.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,070
Another way to gather feedback
is through a live share meeting.

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,870
Live share meetings are instant meetings
where you can share your designs with

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,500
unlimited participants
in a live meeting.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,420
The meeting is free, and is similar
to a GoToMeeting, WebEx, join.me or

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,600
Google Hangout meeting.

13
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,280
In live share meetings, you can see
all participant cursors on screen.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,540
You can activate a drawing mode, where
everyone can draw over your designs.

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,730
Participants of your meeting can
also leave contextual comments,

16
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,020
which get saved instantly,
just like they would when viewing and

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,100
commenting on a share link.
