1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, comes the answer--option D would mean that we have a huge amount of immigration

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
of recovered persons--no.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Option B would mean that the number of susceptible persons is reduced

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
by 100 persons per day that looks like immigration but not like vaccination.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
With option A, we would be changing this coefficient.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If you remember where this coefficient came from, it had to do with the probability of being infected,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
mainly more precised with the probability that a susceptible person is infected

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
by an infectious person and it had to do with the number of contacts.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It doesn't have to do with vaccination.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's option C, we move 5 million persons from the susceptible compartment

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
to the recovered compartment.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Of course, we're cheating a little there. These 5 million persons have not recovered from the illness.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
They are immune as are all other recovered persons.
