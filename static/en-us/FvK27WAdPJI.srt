1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,960
Let's go ahead and
create a new Android project and

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,530
then have a look at
the default build scripts.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,650
We'll give our app a domain,
and a location.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,680
We'll set a min SDK and

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,450
we'll add a blank add
a Blank Activity with a Fragment.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,799
We'll leave the defaults for
the fragment.

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,390
So, here we are in our
newly created Android app.

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,710
If we go ahead and
haul out the ancient test device and

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,850
then run our application,
let's see what happens.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,390
All right, sweet,
it looks like we're up and running.

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,800
So let's dive into what Gradle
configuration is present by default.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,590
Again, the project pane has defaulted to
this Android-centric setup, but I find

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,830
this kind of confusing, so I'm going
to switch back to the project view,

14
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,660
to just show the straight
up project layout.

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,820
So here's our project, and
here's our build.gradle file.

16
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,360
There's a whole lot going on in
the default Android buildscript.

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,450
For starters, this is actually
a multi-project build and

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,120
the Android app itself is a sub project.

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,400
We'll talk all about
multi-project builds in Lesson 4.

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,600
But it's set up this way, so it's easy
to add other sub projects that we want

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,250
to build together with the app
like libraries or even a backend.

22
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,790
There are two things to notice
in this root buildscript.

23
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,440
First, we declare
a buildscript dependency

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,130
on come.android.tools.build:gradle:1.2.2.

25
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,600
There are two things to
note in this buildscript.

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,200
First, we declare a buildscript
dependency on this artifact coordinate.

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,300
This is where the Android plugin for
Gradle lives.

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,390
Second, and we'll talk about this
part of the Gradle API soon.

29
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,630
This block adds the jcenter repository
to every subproject of this build.

30
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,399
That means every subproject can
just declare dependencies and

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,230
they'll automatically be
retrieved from jcenter.

32
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,110
Now let's take a look at
the build script specifically for

33
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,300
the Android build,
which is in the app directory.

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,179
So here's the build script for
the Android app.

35
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,320
Note that it first applies the Android
plug in which it fetched from jCenter.

36
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,199
All configuration happens in
the Android configuration block.

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,320
All that's absolutely required
are the first two lines defining

38
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,179
the SDK version and
the build tools version.

39
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,610
The default config block configures
the attributes of the Android manifest.

40
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,520
We'll talk about the build
types block momentarily.

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,180
Finally, the dependencies block
works just like Java dependencies.

42
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,490
This declares the compile time
dependencies on every jar in the libs

43
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,630
directory and
on the Android Support Library.

44
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,660
Finally, this dependencies block
works just like Java dependencies.

45
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,547
Here we're declaring a dependency on
every jar in the libs directory as well

46
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,380
as on the Android Support Library.
