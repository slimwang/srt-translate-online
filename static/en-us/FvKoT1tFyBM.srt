00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,466
Now, suppose you have an object of a class that implements the drawable

2
00:00:03,466 --> 00:00:09,108
interface. For example, a house, then you can save it in a variable whose type

3
00:00:09,108 --> 00:00:15,580
is the interface. And that intuitively makes sense, a house, is a kind of

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:21,084
drawable. Now that solves our problem. because similarly, we can make an

5
00:00:21,084 --> 00:00:28,030
ArrayList of drawables, and this ArrayList now can hold dogs, houses, whatever.

6
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,452
You simply take any object of any class that implements the drawable interface,

7
00:00:32,452 --> 00:00:38,739
and you add it to the ArrayList. It works, because you can convert from a dog,

8
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:46,010
to a drawable which is what this ArrayList holds. In our same class, we can

9
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:55,220
replace these three ArrayLists with a single one, an ArrayList of drawable. Go

10
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,876
ahead and do that. When you're done, you should have just one ArrayList into

11
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:06,321
which you add three cars, two houses, and three dogs. And down here, you should

12
00:01:06,321 --> 00:01:11,991
have just one loop. Of course, you also need to make sure that the car, house,

13
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:17,491
and dog classes all implement the drawable interface.
