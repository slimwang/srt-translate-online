00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,937
All right. Welcome back to com, Introduction to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,937 --> 00:00:07,368
Today finally, we're going to get to talk about calibrating cameras.

3
00:00:07,368 --> 00:00:10,644
Where we're going to be calibrating with spectra 3D world.

4
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:14,048
So finally, we can get to the parameters of cells.

5
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:18,319
If you remember last time, we solved for the full projection equation.

6
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:22,024
That was made up of really a composition of the translation, rotation,

7
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:23,849
projection and intrinsics.

8
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:27,877
For the rest of today, we're not going to worry about the fact that M

9
00:00:27,877 --> 00:00:31,332
has this internal structure, till maybe the very end.

10
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:33,768
We're going to think of M just this way.

11
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:38,003
That is M is going to be this matrix that's going to take your world points and

12
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:39,708
homogeneous coordinates.

13
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:44,278
And eventually, get you out your image points also in homogeneous coordinates.

14
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:47,130
So what we're going to try to do is find that M.
