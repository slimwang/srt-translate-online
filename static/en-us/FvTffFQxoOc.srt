00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:01,720
All right.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,880
Now that we've done a first pass through control flow,

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,400
let's make some concerted effort to complete the work session,

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,620
the required information for which you will find in the instructor's notes.

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,850
You've already made your work object.

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,670
Using any of the control flow patterns you've learned so

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,560

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,830
format the HTML with the proper templates, and append it to the page.

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,080
Your work section should look like this when you're done.
