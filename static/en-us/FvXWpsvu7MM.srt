00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here's the result of running the Greedy agent over 500 trials.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I've graphed 2 things here:

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
One is the error; and you see, over the top--

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
over the first 40 or so trials--

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the error was very high--way up here.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But then, suddenly, it jumped down

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to a lower level, and stayed along that level all the way through to 500.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I've also graphed, with a dotted line, the policy loss.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What does that mean?--so that's the difference

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
between the policy that the agent has learned and the optimal policy.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So if it had learned the optimal policy, the policy loss would be zero, down here.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It doesn't quite get to zero.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It was high, up here,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and then at around step 40, it learned something important.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What did it learn?--well, here's the final policy that it came up with.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Maybe it started originally going in this direction in hitting the minus 1;

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and then it flipped and learned a new policy that went in a better direction.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But it still hasn't learned the optimal policy.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And we can see--for example, this looks like a mistake here.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
In state 1-2, it's policy is moving down

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and then following this path, which it learned, towards the goal.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But really, a better route would be to take the northern route, and go through this path.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But it hasn't learned that.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Because it was Greedy, it found something

25
00:01:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that seemed to be doing good for it, and then it never deviated from that.
