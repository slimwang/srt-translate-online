1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,060
So you're going to want to experiment
with different types of media, so

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,810
it's not just a simple text ad.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,120
Think video, for example.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,050
Video can perform really
well on a social campaign.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,320
Everybody remembers
the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, right?

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,450
The Ice Bucket challenge was something
that went absolutely viral and

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,930
generated a ton of money for a charity
organization because it was something

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,830
that felt real and fun, and
it wasn't just a very stale text ad.

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,100
I will say, never go into it with
the goal of creating a viral video.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,870
That's a recipe for disaster.

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,420
You always want to create something that
you think is a really great piece of

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,215
compelling content.

13
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:40,365
>> So, I think YouTube is
a really cost-effective place for

14
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:45,395
any small business or startup to
start promoting their business.

15
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:48,925
I think YouTube is a place
where people go and search and

16
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:52,095
try to figure out
are businesses legitimate, and

17
00:00:53,605 --> 00:00:58,450
how do I use this business, or
what is this business all about?

18
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:03,410
So YouTube can be a great place where
users will discover your product,

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,650
and also where you can quickly
explain your value proposition.

20
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,820
So I've seen really creative
15 to 30 second YouTube

21
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:19,940
videos where a business will just
really quickly explain who they are,

22
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:26,360
maybe even a quick navigation of their
site or app, and then a call to action.

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:32,220
So, let's say you want someone
to just download your app today.

24
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,710
I would explain your value proposition,
what a user needs to know about your

25
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,260
business, what sets you apart
from any other competitor.

26
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,830
Then maybe showing
the best case scenario.

27
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,110
How a user would use your app.

28
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,320
And make sure the app navigation
is easy and very clear.

29
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,980
Show that on the video.

30
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,430
And then make it clear that the call
to action is download the app today and

31
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,540
start using your product.

32
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:06,830
So, YouTube is just a great platform for
you to, to explain who you are,

33
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,340
and to do it simply and easily and
really capture an audience.

34
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,070
So once you have that video,

35
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,475
that is just very clear and
who you are and what you can offer.

36
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:20,825
Then you can start using
it as an ad format.

37
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:25,825
So you can use that video to be
placed in YouTube search results

38
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:29,575
as well as before other videos.

39
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:34,620
So those are what we call in stream ad
formats or in stream YouTube videos and

40
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,610
that also is an auction, and so it's
very similar in principle in how you set

41
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:45,010
up the campaign, but the great thing is,
you can use that captivating

42
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:50,460
video as an ad to explain who you are
and capture users followed on YouTube.

43
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,780
So true view is what we call the ad
formats on YouTube that are auction-

44
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,770
based, so
these are ads that you get decide how

45
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,900
much you're willing to bid for
a view of your video.

46
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,360
And the great thing is you only
pay when a user views your video.

47
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,070
So you can place your ad before
other videos, maybe you want

48
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:20,170
to make sure the content is similar,
we can go back to the travel.

49
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:26,140
Example, so if I'm searching for
great places to travel and

50
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,010
then I have let's say your hotel app.

51
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,650
So maybe your ad,
you want to place your video ad before

52
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:42,220
I watch a video about this hotel
resort I'm going to go check out.

53
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:48,790
Okay, so you can target your ads
based on theme or categories.

54
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,840
And so then when your ad
shows before the video,

55
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,030
the user then has a choice to
skip the ad or watch the full ad.

56
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,890
Ideally, the ad is only about 15 or
30 seconds, but

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,940
you only pay when a user watches
30 seconds of the video or

58
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,310
the full length of the video.

59
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,030
So if your video is only 15 seconds and

60
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,430
the user gets to the 15 second mark,
that's when you pay per view.

61
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,070
But, if a user wants to skip
after two or five seconds,

62
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,300
they have the choice to skip the ad.

63
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,220
And what's great about this ad format
is that, your only capturing users that

64
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,090
are engaged,
that actually want to watch this ad,

65
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,730
that are actually
interested in your product.

66
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,350
And the rest,
you didn't even have to pay for, so

67
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,840
maybe they did watch 10 seconds and
maybe they'll think about you later, but

68
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,870
you don't actually have to pay for
that view.
