00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Using the same formula, we are going to write x2 minus x1 as delta x

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
just to make it a little bit simpler.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let me see if we can recover other things.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's assume the range is actually 10 m. We know about the physical world.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We know our baseline 1 m. We know that our focal length is 30 mm.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Can we possibly recover the delta x?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I'd like you to give your answer in mm.
