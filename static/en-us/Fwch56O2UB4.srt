00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,730
We just saw that after one year, if Grant's account compounds interest twice a

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:12,754
year, he'll end up with 10,000 times 1 plus 0.015 squared dollars. Now I want

3
00:00:12,754 --> 00:00:16,146
you to think back to that hypothesis you made earlier and how the situation is

4
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:22,174
different this time. What does this exponent here mean? Well, remember, we're

5
00:00:22,174 --> 00:00:27,161
going to multiply by this number every time interest is compounded. So, what

6
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:31,461
exponents belong here and here? To help us figure out how much money is in the

7
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:34,640
account after 2 years and after 3 years.
