00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,000
So we have one logarithm set equal to another logarithm, and they have the same

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,867
base, this means we can set. These two arguments are numbers equal to one

3
00:00:08,867 --> 00:00:14,750
another. So what do you think are the values of x? Maybe there's two. Maybe

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,284
there's only one that will work for the original equation. Or maybe none of

5
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:22,610
them work and there's no solution. Type your answer in here.
