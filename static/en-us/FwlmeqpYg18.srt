1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,890
So now we know how to provide the daily
special in different languages.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,290
But how do we take the user's
food preference into account?

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,880
That doesn't seem to be a predefined
variable for food preference.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,600
They might be vegan,
they might prefer fish.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,070
We want to show them a special
that suits their taste.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,570
So we're going to use
the tag manager's data layer.

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:28,050
Your app can put values in the data
layer by setting data layer variables.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,030
Then, tag manager can get
the values from the data layer.

9
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:37,450
And use them to figure out which
variable values for your app to use.

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,560
So now I'm going to look
specifically at the daily special.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,890
So the user chooses a food preference,
and

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,020
the app can put that preference in
the food preferable in the data lay out.

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,400
And then, the triggers in the tag
manager can use a data layer variable.

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,160
To determine which
variable value to use for

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,590
your app to display the daily special.

16
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,019
So if the food pref is to prefer meat,
you get a meat special.

17
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,490
If you prefer fish,
you get a fish special.

18
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,440
If you want vegetarian,
you get a veggie special.

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,260
And if you chose vegan, well,
you get a vegan special.

20
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,060
Let's go find out how to
make our app do this.
