Okay, so let's dive in a bit deeper
into the art of splitting data into two.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,940
We look at these six points and there
seem to be many lines that split them.

3
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:13,739
For example, there's this blue one and
there is this yellow one.

4
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:16,480
So here's a quiz.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,429
Which of these two lines do we
think cuts the data better?

6
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:23,189
The yellow one or the blue one?

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,560
