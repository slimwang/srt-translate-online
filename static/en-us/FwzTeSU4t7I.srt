00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,578
The algorithm you just looked at would work if Robby were a person. But Robbie

2
00:00:03,578 --> 00:00:06,980
is a robot, and only knows how to do very simple tasks. Moving to the first

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,570
place where he sees a yellow before a blue is too complicated. He can only do

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,320
simple tasks. So, he could move all the way to the left. Or, he could move all

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,830
the way to the right. He could move one space to the left or one space to the

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,270
right. He can check if the block right in front of you is yellow or blue. And

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,960
he can check if the block, just to his right is yellow or blue. I'm going to

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,070
have you write some pseudo code, but so that I can help you check it, I'm

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,020
going to give you some of the structure up front. Use the pseudo code commands

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,879
over here to write pseudo code to move Robbie to the leftmost yellow brick

11
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,370
that's followed by a blue. These lines are scrambled. Can you type them into

12
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,353
the right positions? You might need to type a line more than once.
