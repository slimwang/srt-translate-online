00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,460
Before we can add wearable features to
the sample, or any other code you might

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,150
have already, we need to get things
ready to make sure it works properly.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,290
Firstly, make sure you're compiling
against the V4 support library.

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,780
Let's open up our build upgrader file,
which is contained here.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,220
And if we scroll down,
it's important that you use this library

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,880
because many notification features
such as action buttons, large icons,

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,000
and Android Wear and auto support have
been added to the framework since then.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,170
And most developers need
to support older devices.

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:28,950
The next thing we need to

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,360
do is make sure our notifications
are issued correctly.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,980
We open up the main activity,
and go down to the bottom here.

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,100
It's important that we replace
the use of notification manager

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,300
with notification manager compact.

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,093
If you try to use notification manager
while supporting older API devices,

15
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:47,595
they'll lose any special
wearable extensions.

16
00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:49,661
So this is the code
change to implement this.

17
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:53,180
We hit Alt + Enter to add
dependencies and then we're done
