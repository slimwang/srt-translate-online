1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,120
Assume that this is a code snippet
from an InboxActivity.java file

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,840
within an email app.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,830
Now there's a lot of code here with
concepts you haven't learned before.

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,880
So it's okay if you didn't
get this one correct.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,360
Let's walk through it together.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,379
First, we create an integer variable
called numberOfEmailsInInbox.

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,530
We initialize the variable
to have a value of 0.

8
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:23,270
Then we create another integer
variable called numberOfDraftEmails.

9
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,700
And we initialize that
to have a value of 2.

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,460
Next we create a string
variable called emailMessage.

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,820
And the value is you have blank emails,

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,350
where blank is actually a variable
referring to numberOfEmailsInInbox.

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,660
So this evaluates to you have 0 emails,
because this variable has a value of 0.

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,090
Next we have another string
variable called draftMessage.

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,120
The value is You have
blank email drafts.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,020
Blank actually refers to
numberofDraftEmails and

17
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,050
this has a value of 2.

18
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,550
So this right hand side maps
to You have 2 email drafts.

19
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,510
So far we have four variables and

20
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,800
nothing has been printed
to the logs yet.

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,485
Now we have an if statement.

22
00:01:06,485 --> 00:01:10,260
There's no else block of code down here,
and that's perfectly fine.

23
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,330
This statement reads if
the numberOfEmailsInInbox = 0,

24
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,190
then perform the code within
these opening and closing braces.

25
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,060
We remember that
numberOfEmailsInInbox is equal to 0,

26
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,170
so this code in the opening and
closing braces would get executed.

27
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,870
It simply updates
the email message variable

28
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,290
to say You have no new messages.

29
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,880
Okay, so we know that the latest value
of email message is You have no new

30
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,150
messages and the latest value
of draft message is up here.

31
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,850
You have 2 email drafts.

32
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,960
Let's continue reading.

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,118
There's another if statement down here.

34
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:49,110
If the numberOfDraftEmails equals 0,

35
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,050
then perform the code within
the opening and closing braces.

36
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,390
However, numberOfDraftEmails
has a value of 2.

37
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:02,620
That means this condition here is false
and we can skip this block of code.

38
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,950
Therefore, the draftMessage
variable stays at the value of You

39
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,830
have 2 email drafts.

40
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,500
It does not update to this new message.

41
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,310
Finally, we're back in a regular
execution flow of the method.

42
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,240
There's no more if statements, and

43
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,710
we can run this line of code
which prints to the logs.

44
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,440
It prints the emailMessage
to the logs and

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,850
then next it prints
the draftMessage to the logs.

46
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,679
At this point in time emailMessage says,
You have no new messages,

47
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:34,360
and draftMessage says,
You have 2 email drafts.

48
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,870
Looking at our choices,
option C is what we want.

49
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,560
Option A is incorrect
because we don't print out

50
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,420
the message at every point in time.

51
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,820
We only have two lines of
code that print to the logs.

52
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,000
Option B is incorrect because
the emailMessage string gets updated

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,660
within the if statement.

54
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,830
And there's actually 2 email drafts,
not 0 email drafts, so

55
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,340
the second log statement
is also incorrect.

56
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,830
That leaves the remaining
correct choice, option C.
