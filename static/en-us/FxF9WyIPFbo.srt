00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,005
We going to wrap this lesson up with one last question. What proportion of the

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:08,628
difference in pairs of shoes owned can be attributed to gender? In other words,

3
00:00:08,628 --> 00:00:12,786
you found that the difference between the pairs of shoes owned on average by

4
00:00:12,786 --> 00:00:18,516
our sample of males and females, was about 15. How much of this difference can

5
00:00:18,516 --> 00:00:24,174
be explained by the fact that some are males and some are female? This is found

6
00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:28,614
by r squared, which is the ratio of our t-statistic squared, divided by t

7
00:00:28,614 --> 00:00:32,619
squared plus the degrees of freedom.
