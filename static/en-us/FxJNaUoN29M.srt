1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,620
Precomputing, all early
standards were for data.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,420
Physicians would use ICD,
a classification of diseases,

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,660
in their notes.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,860
The clinical laboratory would have
a classification for their tests.

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,110
And the pharmacy would
have a classification for

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,590
the medications they dispense.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,380
As computers came into use in hospitals,
the various departments needed to share

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,745
information, but were using their
own specialized computer systems.

9
00:00:30,745 --> 00:00:34,135
This led to early messaging standards.

10
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:37,795
These meant a physician could order
a lab test or medication at the nurse's

11
00:00:37,795 --> 00:00:41,755
station, and that order could be routed
electronically to the appropriate

12
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:46,215
department to do the test or
send the medication.

13
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:50,810
The next evolution was standards for
clinical documents.

14
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,540
A message might typically be
an order for a lab test or

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,040
medication, but what if you want
a complete summary of a patient's care

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,510
to send to the patient's physician once
they're discharged from the hospital?

17
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,170
This is the role of document standards.

18
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,050
More recently, as computers have become
more powerful, standards have been

19
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,069
evolving to represent clinical
workflows and processes.

20
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,785
These have often been
targeted at hospitals, but

21
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:20,190
have proven to be hard to develop and
implement.

22
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,280
If this could be overcome, they could,
at least in theory, lead to a reduction

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,280
in unnecessary variations in
the way patients are cared for.
