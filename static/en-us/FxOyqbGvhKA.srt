00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,620
All right,
we've learned a lot in this lesson.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,240
Let's take a quick recap before
we move on to the last exercise.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,580
We covered what ARIA does
to the accessibility tree.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,210
Essentially, ARIA allows you to
intervene and do some tree surgery

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,820
before the accessibility tree is
exposed to assistive technology.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,400
From changing the role name or
properties of a single element

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,180
through to actually removing or
moving parts of the tree route.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,430
We talked about how to use the role
attribute to modify the role

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,790
of a single element.

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,070
We saw how to use the ARIA spec to find
information about roles and attributes.

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,520
For example, we can use the ARIA
spec to find a specific role

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,670
then dive down into the detailed
information for that role, to

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,200
learn about what attributes it supports
and what default semantics it may have.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,220
Similarly, we can find information
about particular aria properties.

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,645
We learnt how to use ARIA
extended labeling options.

16
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:55,490
Aria-label, to provide a screen
reader only label string.

17
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:00,380
Aria-labeledby, to refer to some
visible element as a label.

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,470
And aria-describedby, to provide some
extra information alongside the label.

19
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,700
We looked at the way ARIA can
specify semantic relationships

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,868
beyond the labeledby and
describedby relationships.

21
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:14,710
Such as aria-owns to modify
the shape of the accessibility tree.

22
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,230
We examine the default semantics
of native HTML elements, and so

23
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,950
that some of those semantics may
not be overridden with ARIA.

24
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,560
We learned that ARIA has
a set of landmark and

25
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,640
document structure roles to help users
navigate and understand page structure.

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,680
We looked at how to hide things
from assistive technology.

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,330
Or show things only to
assistive technology.

28
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,270
And lastly, we spent some time
exploring Aria-live regions.

29
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,050
This is really only the very
basics of ARIA, but

30
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,620
it should be enough to help you
understand what ARIA can offer and

31
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,430
how to read and understand the ARIA
documentation to learn more.
