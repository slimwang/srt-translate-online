1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,740
To improve our networking code,

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,570
we need to find a way to reduce the
redundancy between each network request.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,030
Right now, we're looking at
the login view controller and

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,360
we have this split view.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,020
On the left we have the get
Session ID method, and

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,510
on the right we have the get User ID
method, and there's a lot of

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,200
code duplication between these requests,
as well as our other requests.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,300
Now these methods have
been modified ever so

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,710
slightly since the MyFavoriteMovies app,
but nothing drastic,

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,630
you should be able to follow this.

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,980
Now what we want to do is
identify what's common between

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,880
both of these requests.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,200
This is what's going to allow us to
create a reusable piece of code to get

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,160
rid of all the stuplication.

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,020
For example, in each of these requests,

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,800
we don't need to duplicate
adding the ApiKey.

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,260
Both of these methods take the API key.

18
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,150
So maybe we can pull that out.

19
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,830
And if we keep looking we'll find
plenty more examples of this.

20
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,290
So for this exercise called
Abstracting Away Redundant Code I'm

21
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,270
going to provide you with a code
snippet of the getSessionID method.

22
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,046
And this code snippet,
you can find in the instructor notes.

23
00:01:01,046 --> 00:01:04,596
And you're going to look at this snippet
and determine which sections of the code

24
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:07,840
are redundant by comparing it
to the other network request.

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,507
And finding these redundancies is
going to be such a valuable skill for

26
00:01:11,507 --> 00:01:14,144
you to practice and
it's going to give us a basis for

27
00:01:14,144 --> 00:01:15,699
how to build our API client.

28
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:17,857
Now when you're done
looking at the code and

29
00:01:17,857 --> 00:01:21,299
you found the sections you think
are redundant, I want you to enter for

30
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,580
the section numbers as a comma
separated list in this box.

31
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,280
For example, if the redundant
sections are 2, 4 and 8,

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,970
then your answer should look like this.

33
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,000
And the sections are numbered within
the code snippet that you'll download.
