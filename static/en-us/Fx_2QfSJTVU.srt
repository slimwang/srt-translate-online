00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,190
Now, I'll show you another function that is actually exponential time but also isn't that bad.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,000
What about 1.1^n?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,290
Absolutely not a polynomial time algorithm but still a huge speedup compared to 2^n.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:20,160
Let's do another quiz here--speedup of 1.1^n versus 2^n, and again,

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,740
we're going to say that n=50 then you don't have to recalculate this here.

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,970
You already know that it's about 10ยนโต and I'll give you the same choices here.

7
00:00:29,970 --> 99:59:59,999
Is the speedup bigger than a million, bigger than a billion, or bigger than a trillion.
