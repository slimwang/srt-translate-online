00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,848
We've now found out that if Grant sets his price per wiper blade set equal to

2
00:00:04,848 --> 00:00:09,971
$46, he will earn the maximum profit he can of $290,000. But, of course, there

3
00:00:09,971 --> 00:00:15,074
may be factors that prevent him from setting his price exactly equal to this

4
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:19,614
amount. And he wants to rule out a few other prices that would lead to the worst

5
00:00:19,614 --> 00:00:24,233
case scenario, or at least one of the worst case scenarios, no profit at all. If

6
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:28,493
Grant wants to know what he would need to set his price per wiper blade set

7
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:32,895
equal to, to have his profit equal 0, what point or points on our graph are we

8
00:00:32,895 --> 00:00:37,405
interested in? Do we want to know about the vertex, the maximum, the minimum,

9
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:40,459
the c-intercept or intercepts, or the p-intercept?
