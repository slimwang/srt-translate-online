1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,009
now that you've seen the concepts behind

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,500
regression classification and neural

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,209
networks you're ready to start building

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:09,210
in the next lab you're going to move

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,710
from the high-level concepts down to the

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,718
low-level details you'll build your own

7
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:14,669
neural network library and implement

8
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:17,250
back propagation by hand back

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,289
propagation is a pretty mind-bending

10
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,660
concept and I remember how coating it up

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,789
myself for the first time really helped

12
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,859
me get a better grasp of it i hope it

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,279
helps you to
