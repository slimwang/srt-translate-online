00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,730
Well, if we're to deal with this challenge of increasing growth in distributed

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,950
applications, we should consider what kinds of technologies we can use to

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:14,264
support them. One category are technologies that provide abstractions, okay?

4
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:19,505
In particular, the abstractions take the form of interfaces realized as

5
00:00:19,505 --> 00:00:23,986
application programmer interfaces, or APIs, such as Ajax or

6
00:00:23,986 --> 00:00:28,714
Enterprise JavaBeans. Standards, think HTTP or

7
00:00:28,714 --> 00:00:33,021
new kinds of architectures such as REST architectures or

8
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:39,822
service oriented architectures. similarly, the development of new notations.

9
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:45,751
Over the last, maybe ten years we've seen the increasing penetration of

10
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:51,420
XML into applications. And similarly, there's been the development of tools and

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,004
that support the development of these kinds of systems such as WebSphere or

12
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:59,330
Hibernate. You may have heard of those. In the design space,

13
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,891
there's Oracle's Fusion and there are even code generators for,

14
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:07,010
for transforming or generating the XML such as XSLT.
