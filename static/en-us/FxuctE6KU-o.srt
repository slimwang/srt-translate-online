00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,237
This time we're going to find the equation of the line that's perpendicular to

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:08,438
this line. It still passes through the same point 1, 2. We knew the slope of

3
00:00:08,438 --> 00:00:12,607
this line was negative 3 halves. So, what was the slope of our line be if it's

4
00:00:12,607 --> 00:00:16,155
going to be perpendicular to this line? Write your answer here.
