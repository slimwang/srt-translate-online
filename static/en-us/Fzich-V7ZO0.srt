1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,194
So if we bring up our handy-dandy z-table, we're looking for 0.005, because

2
00:00:05,194 --> 00:00:15,138
0.005 times 2 is 0.01. So here's 0.0051 and 0.0049, so z-critical value is

3
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:25,408
negative 2.57, or negative 2.58. It doesn't really matter too much, we'll just

4
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:32,570
say it's about negative 2.57. So if a proportion of 0.005 is less than negative

5
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:41,772
2.57, a proportion of positive 0.005 is greater than positive 2.57. So our z

6
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:47,568
critical values are negative 2.57 and positive 2.57 and we can just shorten

7
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:51,564
this to plus or minus 2.57.
