1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,972
While you're learning,
it's a good idea to activate

2
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:07,374
a few menus that allow you to
watch what auto layout is doing.

3
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:11,780
So go to Editor, Canvass, and

4
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:15,517
Show Layout Rectangles.

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:23,210
Then Editor, Canvass, Show Involved
Views For Selected Constraints.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,969
These are like training wheels.

7
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:29,599
As soon as you feel more comfortable,
you can get rid of them.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,350
Once you activate the layout rectangles,
you should notice that it displays

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,600
margins within the views.

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,500
Margins are a new feature in iOS 8.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,880
And they allow for
layouts to have some breathing space.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,603
It's highly recommended that you use
them, unless you have to support iOS 7.
