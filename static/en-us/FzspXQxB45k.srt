1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,260
All right, munchkins.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,190
This is the wizard welcome you back
to introduction to computer vision.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,030
As you can tell, I'm, sort of,
energized and I've taken some time off,

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,950
about a year or two or so.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,280
What we're going to do this time
is start working on tracking.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,660
So the last unit or
at least some previous one, hopefully,

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,090
that depending upon the order
in which you're viewing these.

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,600
We were looking at motion which
was sort of the change in imagery

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,540
between two successive frames.

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,080
And that change could be due to a change
in viewpoint multiple cameras or

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,250
a change in time, you're watching
something move over awhile.

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,760
This unit is going to focus on tracking,
where objects are moving over time and

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,960
the computations that we're
doing are to keep track of them.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,550
And it is sort of a fundamental
part of computer vision these days.

15
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,280
Although, a lot of what we're going to
be talking about will eventually get

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,780
into things that are come
from the domain of robotics.

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,380
Because there has just been a lot
of work done on sort of how you

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,578
keep track of things overtime,
we'll do a lot of modelling.

19
00:01:00,578 --> 00:01:03,930
Also, I want to say again, a bunch of
slides adapted from Kristen Grauman,

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,890
Deva Ramanan and
Svetlana Laze, Lazebnik.

21
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,530
And I, Svetlana, if I messed
up your name, I'm, I'm sorry.
