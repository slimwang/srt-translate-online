00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,380
On the new site we
were looking at before,

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,890
when we made the screen size smaller,
we couldn't see all of the elements.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,780
So responsive design would
really help this website.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,060
The content would then
adapt to fit any device.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,300
The front end developers
that made this website,

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,480
can also work with designers to
create multiple mock ups for

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,390
the website to show all of the content,
even with different screen sizes.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:30,130
While front end developers do focus
on optimizing website loading speeds,

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,170
this wouldn't exactly help
the problem of a responsive website.

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,420
Finally, front end developers don't
actually handle storing client

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,760
data in a database.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,010
That's something that
backend programmers work on,

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,350
which we'll learn about more later.
