1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,111
If you take a look at Rick Szeliski's book which we mentioned earlier,

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:06,841
you can see a whole bunch of Fourier Transform pairs.

3
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:12,113
For example the impulse, which is drawn like that has a Fourier Transform of 1.

4
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:15,518
As we said that makes sense, because the impulse when you convolve it,

5
00:00:15,518 --> 00:00:17,732
just gives you back the original function, so

6
00:00:17,732 --> 00:00:19,854
you'd better keep all of the frequencies.

7
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:23,789
Likewise, we said here that the Fourier Transform of a Gaussian is

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:24,992
another Gaussian.

9
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:27,661
But again, G of sigma goes to 1 over sigma.

10
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:31,499
So fat Gaussian in space, skinny Gaussian in frequency.

11
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,000
But look at this one.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,474
If I have a box filter, which is just a filter that's shaped like a box,

13
00:00:37,474 --> 00:00:40,474
it produces what's called the sinc function.

14
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:41,709
Okay. And that's drawn here.

15
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,512
And let's look at that a little more closely, okay?

16
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:48,519
So here in this spatial domain, we have our box filter and

17
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:50,451
this is our sinc function.

18
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:54,955
All right? Now sinc of x is sine x over x, all right?

19
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:58,534
And we can think about that, if you take the limit as x goes to zero of the,

20
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:02,730
you remember L'Hopital's rule take the derivative of the top that's the cosine.

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,099
Derivative of the bottom is just one plug in a zero it's one.

22
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,571
So the, the limit as x goes to zero is in fact, one right there.

23
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:14,120
And then as x gets bigger, the sine gets attenuated and

24
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,444
that's what you're seeing here.

25
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:21,849
So in other words, if I were to convolve something with a box filter.

26
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:25,019
My frequencies are going to behave kind of in a weird way.

27
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:28,507
You know, I have this nice kind of low pass stuff, but then I'm going to have

28
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:31,725
these various other frequencies that are going to get accentuated.

29
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:37,031
And if you remember, we did that very early on when we introduced filtering.

30
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:40,568
Remember, we convolved something with a box, with a square?

31
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:42,670
And we said, man is that ugly?

32
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,538
This is why it's ugly.

33
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:45,573
So you see this picture here?

34
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:47,908
You see how it's got all these little striations.

35
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:51,910
And I said, when we first did this, that that's because boxes aren't smooth and

36
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,117
that we would make this more formal when we did Fourier analysis.

37
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:56,951
Well, I made good in my promise.

38
00:01:56,951 --> 00:02:01,683
Okay? The reason that when you convolve an image with that

39
00:02:01,683 --> 00:02:06,343
little square box that you see all this junk is because of

40
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:10,030
this ringing here in the frequency domain.

41
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,100
That's why we said, what you should do is do what?

42
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,378
Is you should apply a Gaussian not a box,

43
00:02:14,378 --> 00:02:18,405
it makes a nice, pretty picture, you know, a nice, smooth picture.

44
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:22,676
Because in the frequency domain, you get this nice, smooth Gaussian.

45
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,546
One more thing about these sinc functions, okay?

46
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:30,284
So we showed that the Fourier Transform of a box is the sinc.

47
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:36,668
Well, because of the symmetry, if I had a box in frequency space,

48
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:41,228
that would be a sinc in the spatial domain.

49
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:47,709
So what if I were to take some function, take its Fourier spectrum and

50
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:52,640
multiply it by that box, what would that look like?

51
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,542
Well, I already just showed you that.

52
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:58,746
Right? This is essentially, it's sometimes called a pillbox, because it's a box.

53
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:03,918
But in 2D, that is instead of being just a particular width, it's a radius.

54
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:05,052
Right?

55
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:08,860
So everything outside that diameter is set to zero and

56
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,492
everything inside is kept exactly.

57
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:15,451
If you remember the picture we got was this ugly picture with all

58
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:16,730
this ringing in it.

59
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,732
Well, now we know why.

60
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:24,380
When you multiple the frequency by a box, it's as if you convolve

61
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:30,044
the image with its Fourier pair over here with the sinc function.

62
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,502
So if you take this pretty picture and

63
00:03:32,502 --> 00:03:37,751
you convolve it with this ugly beast, you get something that looks like that.

64
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,887
And that's where the ringing comes from.

65
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,443
That's why you never want to just cut out the high frequencies, because

66
00:03:43,443 --> 00:03:47,970
what you're essentially doing is convolving your image with a sinc function.
