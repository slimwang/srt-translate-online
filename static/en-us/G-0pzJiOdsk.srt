1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,578
So let's pick one of these graphs to play with a little bit more so we can get

2
00:00:02,578 --> 00:00:06,520
better acquainted with rational functions. As I'm looking at these equations, I

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,110
think that h of x is equal to 1 over x would be a great one to start out with.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,030
So, let's pick that, I'm going to blow it up here for you. So here's our graph

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,897
blown up. Now there actually are two lines for the graph of y equals 1 over x

6
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:23,917
will never cross. Can you tell from the graph here, or from the equation, what

7
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:28,890
those two lines are? Please type in their equations right there. Now, don't

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,798
worry at all if you don't get them. I'm going to talk a lot more about this, in

9
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:32,899
just a bit.
