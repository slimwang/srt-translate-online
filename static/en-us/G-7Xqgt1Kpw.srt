00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,670
David, what do you think?

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,250
>> So the second goal is
pretty straightforward.

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,880
We're using the same proposition, but

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,020
here we're operating on the Ladder
instead of on the Ceiling.

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,990
And then for

6
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,890
the goal state we're just going to link
the two together with a conjunction, so

7
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,080
we're saying that our goal state is
Painted(Ceiling) and Painted(Ladder).

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,680
>> Good.

9
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,540
Let's move on then.
