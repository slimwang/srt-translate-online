1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,170
And luckily there's not many houses here, so a bit of playing around,

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,070
I think you can get it.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,470
So first, you have to take this long road over here,

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,210
because any other way to travel over here is

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,270
much longer and then you still need to go back,

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,130
so with a bit of playing around, you can find out

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,040
you can find out that the next house to visit is this one here.

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,470
Then it's almost obvious that you should go up here.

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,250
Now here, you can choose to take the fast way to this house

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,220
up here or the one that takes a bit longer;

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,220
actually, it's better here to go down,

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,790
because otherwise, you'll have to visit some of these houses multiple times.

13
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,330
Then you can go back up here, and then you go over here,

14
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,810
and then it's almost obvious, because you have to drive to base, anyway.

15
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,090
That--this is the last one you have to visit,

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,680
and then you go back to base, and the total time for this is,

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,910
and I calculated this for you as a service,

18
00:00:46,910 --> 99:59:59,999
167 minutes.
