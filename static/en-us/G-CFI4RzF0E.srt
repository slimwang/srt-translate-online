1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,192
So now we know one hour and four minutes really equals 16 15ths hours. So, now

2
00:00:05,192 --> 00:00:10,950
our total time is in only the units of hours. Knowing this, what equation can

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,552
we write to solve for x? The equation needs to involve the time going upstream,

4
00:00:15,552 --> 00:00:19,630
the time going downstream, and the total amount of time.
