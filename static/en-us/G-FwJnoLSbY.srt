00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,520
Okay so I'm going to try to figure this out. How do I change a field type? So

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,520
View Fields, and if I scroll down. We've got

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,540
our Festival field. This is the relationship, the lookup.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,320
>> Yeah.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,530
>> So I'm going to try this. I'm going to try to hit Edit. Change Field type.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,290
>> There you go.

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,665
>> Hey that wasn't so bad.

8
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:23,801
>> Mm-hm.

9
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:25,270
>> Okay, all this stuff still

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:25,990
makes sense.

11
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,140
>> And the great thing about this is you can do this with any field type,

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,280
not just relationships. So if you ever need

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,110
to change a field down the line, you can.
