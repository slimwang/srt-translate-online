1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is this one. Two-twenty is less than 229 or 239.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Take it off the frontier. Put it on explored.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Add in 2 more paths and sum them up.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, 220 plus 146 is 366.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And 220 plus 97 is 317.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay, and now, notice that we're closing in on Bucharest.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We've got 2 neighbors almost there, but neither of them is their turn yet.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Instead, the cheapest path is this one over here,

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
so move it to the explored list.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Add 70 to the path cost so far,

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and we get 299.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now the cheapest node is 239 here,

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
so we expand, finally, into Bucharest at a cost of 460.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And now the question is are we done? Can we terminate the algorithm?
