1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now we've seen all the gory details

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
in how to implement parsing

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
for languages like HTML and JavaScript.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Recall that parsing takes some tokens as input

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and produces a parse tree--

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
something like this, perhaps.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In our next exciting episode we're going to learn how to interpret languages

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
by walking over their parse trees.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For example, maybe this is equal to 7.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's find out.
