00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,368
Before we can write any code, we need to figure out what the expected values

2
00:00:03,368 --> 00:00:10,065
are. This green rectangle is what our rectangle grows to. This point should be

3
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:20,936
at 45 minus 20 and 90 minus 20. So our expected value of x, would be 25. And

4
00:00:20,936 --> 00:00:25,956
your expected value of y would be 70. The width would be 60 plus 20 on one

5
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:34,189
side, and 20 on the other side, so 100. And the height would be 90 plus 20 at

6
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:40,227
the top and 20 at the bottom, so 130. So in the test program, I would create my

7
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:45,636
new rectangle and I would print out my expected value for x. And remember, this

8
00:00:45,636 --> 00:00:49,752
is just a comment. And expected value for y, expected value for width, and the

9
00:00:49,752 --> 00:00:54,496
expected value for height. I want to compare these to the actual values.

10
00:00:54,496 --> 00:01:02,975
box.getX, gets me the, actual value, of X for box. Box.getY gets the actual

11
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:08,269
value for Y for the box. And I do the same thing for width and heighth. Now I

12
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:12,554
can run my test program. I had a couple of syntax errors, so I just fixed those

13
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:20,066
up, and now I can actually run it. And I printed, 45, 25, 90, 70, 60, 100, 90,

14
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:31,046
and 130. Looks like the actual values don't match my expectations. What went

15
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:37,160
wrong? It looks like I created the rectangle and then printed out the actual

16
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:43,942
and expected values without actually calling grove. And now if I run it again,

17
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:55,564
I get the actual is 70, expected is 70, 100, 100, 130, 130, and 25, 25. That's

18
00:01:55,564 --> 00:02:00,708
much better. Based on these test results, I'd say the grow method works about,

19
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,449
the way it says it will.
