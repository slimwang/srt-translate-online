00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,755
Let's start by changing this radical sign to a power. Cube roots give us powers

2
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:09,150
of 1 over 3. Notice that I put the parentheses around the entire quantity,

3
00:00:09,254 --> 00:00:13,637
negative 8x to the 6th since the radical sign extended over all of those

4
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:18,425
factors. Now, all we need to do is what we did in the last quiz, distribute this

5
00:00:18,437 --> 00:00:23,651
exponent to both of the factors in the term. That gives us negative 8 to the 1

6
00:00:23,663 --> 00:00:28,418
3rd times x to the 6th to the 1 3rd. The number that we need to multiply by

7
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,579
itself 3 times to get negative 8 is negative 2. So, that's our coefficient. And

8
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:38,099
the cube root of x to the 6th is just x squared. So, our final answer is

9
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:39,432
negative 2x squared.
