1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,790
So now we can see the code for
resolve sign in error and

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:03,880
we can see how it works.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,930
First of all, if we don't
already have a sign in intent,

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,100
we want to execute this code.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,030
If we have one already we'll just wait
for it do it's activity callback.

6
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,760
So what we're going to do is we're
going to first of all set the sign in

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,000
progress to say,
the state is in progress.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,960
And then we're going to call
the startIntentSenderForResult.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,080
Check the documentation for this one.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,440
What it does basically is it takes your
sign in intent's intent sender, and

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,340
then you tell it the RC_SIGN_IN code so

12
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,200
it's actually sign in intent
that we're working on.

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,570
This needs to be put
in a try catch clause.

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,000
So the catch would be
IntentSender.SendIntentException,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,430
in which case we're
just going to log it.

16
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,960
And we're going to change
our sign-in progress.

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,020
If it errors of course,
we'll also try to reconnect the client.

18
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,060
So now this is what we did if
we didn't have a sign-in intent.

19
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,080
And of course, if we did have one
already we'll just show a dialog saying

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,090
there was an error.

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,610
Though sometimes it can happen where
it's unable to provide an intent.

22
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,410
We don't get the accounts intent.

23
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,490
And we don't get the confirmation
screen or anything like that.

24
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,940
And in that case we'll
just log an error.

25
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,000
Now this intent will also generate an on
activity result, so we just need to

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,720
implement an on activity result code for
the results coming back from the intent.
