00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,130
I haven't talked about how to convert from U,V values to texels, that's a

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:08,032
formula you can figure out. We have a texture of size 16 by 16 applied to a

3
00:00:08,032 --> 00:00:13,668
square, the U axis goes along the columns, the V axis goes up the rows. The

4
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:18,684
lower left corner texel has a location of 00. The upper right is 15 15. With

5
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:24,047
the X axis coordinate listed first. The lower left corner of this 00 texel has

6
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:31,815
UV coordinates of 0.0, 0.0. The upper right has 1.0, 1.0. So the question to

7
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:38,390
you is, what Texel is at location U,V equals to 0.72, 0.40. By the way, I want

8
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,050
integer answers, not floating point.
