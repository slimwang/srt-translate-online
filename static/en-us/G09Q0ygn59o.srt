Thanks Greg. Our emotion involves changes in the brain as well as the body.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,432
There are particular brain regions that are involved in the experience and

3
00:00:07,432 --> 00:00:13,284
expression of emotion. More than any other brain structure, the amygdala is

4
00:00:13,284 --> 00:00:19,045
active in controlling emotional experience, especially fear. It's been shown

5
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:23,115
that people who have damage to the amygdala, don't actually show fear.

6
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:27,068
Relatedly, psychopaths, people who are cold and remorseless individuals, who

7
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:30,549
deceive and lie their way through life, often have an abnormally small

8
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:36,365
malfunctioning amygdala. In addition, some violent criminals have been show to

9
00:00:36,365 --> 00:00:40,897
have tumors on their amygdala. The Amygdala is also involved in recognizing

10
00:00:40,897 --> 00:00:44,319
fear in other people, based on their facial expressions, but not other

11
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:49,854
emotions. In addition, it's important to note, the left prefrontal cortex is

12
00:00:49,854 --> 00:00:55,790
most active when experiencing positive emotions, such as joy or happiness.

13
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,758
However on the other hand, the right prefrontal cortex is most active when we

14
00:00:59,758 --> 00:01:05,229
experience negative emotions, such as fear or sadness. And when we experience

15
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:07,744
pleasure, the hypothalamus is active.
