00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,623
So here is your solution. Take a second to
look at the placement of each name, and

2
00:00:05,635 --> 00:00:11,486
recall how this diagram actually works.
Any circle that's contained within another

3
00:00:11,498 --> 00:00:17,240
circle is a subset of that larger set. For
example, natural numbers are a subset of

4
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:22,741
the whole numbers. This means that if a
number belongs in a certain category it

5
00:00:22,753 --> 00:00:27,964
also belongs in every category that
surrounds that circle. So all natural

6
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:33,711
numbers are whole numbers, and integers,
and rational numbers, and real numbers.
