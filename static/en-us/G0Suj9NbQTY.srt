00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,320
The last mental disorder that we will discuss, is one that has affected people

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,659
throughout history and is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disorder. And

3
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:14,070
that's schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia may hear voices that no one

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,318
else hears. They think people are plotting against them to harm them. Or, they

5
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:23,634
believe people are reading their minds or controlling their thoughts. In order

6
00:00:23,634 --> 00:00:27,540
to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, symptoms must persist for at least one

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,473
month. In addition, at least one of the symptoms must be either dilusions,

8
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:37,916
hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The other symptoms must be grossly

9
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:44,038
disorganized behavior or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms. By negative

10
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:48,028
symptoms we mean for example a person not speaking or being unable to

11
00:00:48,028 --> 00:00:52,451
experience emotion. Let's go back to Susan to look at some of these in more

12
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:53,410
detail.
