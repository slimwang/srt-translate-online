Unlike a fish-eye lens, lines remain straight on the screen with both a

00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:08,511
perspective and an orthographic transform. Normal perspective matrices cause

3
00:00:08,511 --> 00:00:12,790
distant objects to appear smaller. Orthographic do not. The Z depth varies

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,327
nonlinearly with perspective. It's linear with orthographic. The nonlinearity

5
00:00:17,327 --> 00:00:20,194
for perspective is connected with the fact that lines stay straight when

6
00:00:20,194 --> 00:00:24,775
transformed. In perspective, parallel lines usually meet at a vanishing point.

00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:28,061
Orthographic is useful in computer-aided design, because lines are made

00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,080
parallel.
