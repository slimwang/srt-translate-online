00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,131
Let's define some terms for various camera moves. Here's a top down drawing of

2
00:00:04,131 --> 00:00:08,680
a viewer and an object. When you adjust the field of view, that's zoom. When

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,470
you move directly towards or away from an object you're looking at, that's

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,417
dollying, it's not zooming. I have a zoom on my camera does not mean, if I want

5
00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:19,914
to make something larger, I run toward it and I yell zoom. It's so easy in

6
00:00:19,914 --> 00:00:23,316
computer graphics to either zoom in or dolly in, that they're sometimes not

7
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:27,782
that easy to tell apart. However, they're certainly different in their effect

8
00:00:27,782 --> 00:00:31,402
on the camera's field of view and location. The one giveaway that you're

9
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:35,890
dollying and not zooming is that if new faces become visible or disappear.

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,730
Zooming changes the size of the image scene, but does not change visibility.

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,568
All that said, I'll sometimes say zoom in, when the controls are actually dolly

12
00:00:42,568 --> 00:00:46,880
controls, just because most people don't know what dolly in means. The camera

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,280
controls for most of the programs in this course have the mouse wheel and

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,370
middle mouse button set to dolly the view in and out. The other common camera

15
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,054
moves are panning and orbiting. Panning means moving left or right as you keep

16
00:00:57,054 --> 00:01:00,956
the camera pointed forward. For most programs we're using, the right mouse

17
00:01:00,956 --> 00:01:05,030
button pans. Orbitting means circling around the target position, similar to

18
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,031
how a satellite orbits the earth. For those of you into first person shooters,

19
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:12,250
it's circle strafing a target. The target location is often placed at the

20
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,326
center of whatever object is to be examined. In most of our programs, left

21
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:20,094
mouse orbits around a target location. Incidentally all these mouse moves are

22
00:01:20,094 --> 00:01:23,700
just what we happen to use. There are no iron clad standards among programs

23
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,690
about which mouse button does what.
