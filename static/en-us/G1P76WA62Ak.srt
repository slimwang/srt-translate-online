00:00:00,286 --> 00:00:03,490
So now, let's just talk to you about Indexes, and

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,350
how every query needs to have an Index. So let's see

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,950
what happens, if you deploy an application to app spot, that

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,970
requires a new index. So what we're going to do, is

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,920
update our Filter Playground Method. You may have called this method

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,150
something else, but this is the method where you've been adding

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,260
your hardwired filters. Anyway, we're going to update it to filter

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,700
for another thing. So for example, let's filter it for conferences

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,400
in June. So we just filter on month equals six, because

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,590
the month is recorded by an integer and six is June.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,130
After you've added this filter, go ahead and deploy your application

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,490
directly to app spot. In this case, do not run the

13
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,590
query on local host first. I know I've been telling you

14
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,840
always run it on local host first, but now I want

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,890
you to see what happens if you don't. So, don't run

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,160
it on local host, just run it directly on app spot.

17
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,120
Try running your query in the API's explorer. What happens?
