1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,420
This is great.

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,340
Now you have your record audio
function executing every time

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,880
the user presses
the record audio button.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,530
This is an example of going
from user interface element,

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,760
in this case the record button,
to your code using an IP action.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,210
What about going to the other way,
from code to user interface element?

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,300
Maybe we want to enable or
disable a button,

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,200
or we want to change
the text of a label.

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,920
When you go from code to UI element, you
use a connection called an IB outlet,

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,980
otherwise known as an outlet
from code to UI element.

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,850
Let's add that one of those in.

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,590
To start with,
let's open back the inspector's panel

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,370
by clicking this button
here on the top right.

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,630
Make sure that library's
selected here on the right.

15
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,970
In addition, for a moment, I'm going to
come out of the assistant editor

16
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,680
just to give me more screen real estate.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,830
There we go.

18
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,500
Now I can see my interface.

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,440
I'm going to drag over a label and
a button.

20
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,095
To start with,
I'm going to search for a label.

21
00:00:57,095 --> 00:00:57,940
Found the one.

22
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,170
I'm going to drag one here.

23
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,379
And I'm going to name
this label Tap to Record.

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,160
And I'm going to reposition
it back in the middle.

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,540
And then, I'm going to search for
a button.

26
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,510
I'm going to drag
another button on here.

27
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,565
Try to center it as best as I
can in the center of the screen.

28
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:22,090
Double-click inside, and type in
Stop Recording for the button's text.

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,580
Don't worry about the layout yet.

30
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,190
We're going to tackle
that in just a bit.

31
00:01:27,305 --> 00:01:30,730
Now, pay attention,
because here comes the unintuitive part.

32
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,910
We want to make a connection
from code to UI element,

33
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,900
in this case the Tap to Record lable.

34
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,270
From the document outline,

35
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,260
find our Tap to Record label
as you can see highlight here.

36
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,150
Hold down the Ctrl key, and
drag it into our ViewController class.

37
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,060
Select outlet, and
name this recording label.

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,720
You can now see Xcode's
created an outlet for

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,800
us linking the UI element into code,
or, as we're going to use it,

40
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,694
an outlet from code,
where we can change the UI element.

41
00:02:02,694 --> 00:02:04,390
Let's use this IB outlet.

42
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,800
Let's make the text change after
the record button has been pressed.

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,540
So, what we want here is we want
the text of the recording label

44
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,050
to change when the record
button is pressed.

45
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,270
You already know which code gets called
when the recording button is pressed,

46
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,390
that's the function we wrote earlier
as an IB action, right here.

47
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,800
We can add the following line
to the recordAudio function.

48
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,250
If you run the app now, and
press on the Record audio button,

49
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,710
you should be able to see the text
change to Recording in progress.

50
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,450
We can see that our label and
button are not positioned correctly.

51
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,200
That's okay.

52
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,720
If we press this button,

53
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,730
we should see this change from Tap to
Record into Recording in progress.

54
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,410
So, we've used an IB action to receive
an interaction, even on a button.

55
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,060
And then, we used an IB outlet to
reach back from code to UI element,

56
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,180
in this case, the label and
change this text.
