1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:06,750
If we plug in 0 as our input we get 7 times 5 times 0 which is just 0. So if the

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,334
cut side is 0, the volume of the box will be 0. This makes sense because there

3
00:00:10,334 --> 00:00:13,682
will be no flaps to fold up since there would have been nothing cut out of the

4
00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:16,994
original rectangle. You won't be able to make a box at all and it definitely

5
00:00:16,994 --> 00:00:20,795
wouldn't be able to hold anything. So it makes sense that the volume of that

6
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:26,815
would be 0. Plugging in 2 to this equation gives us v of 2 equals 6. Plugging 3

7
00:00:26,815 --> 00:00:32,531
in gives us for the volume of negative 3. And last but not least, if we plug in

8
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:36,133
4 for x, we end up with a volume of 12 cubic inches.
