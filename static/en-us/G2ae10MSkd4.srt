Here, I have another question for you. What does the myelin sheath do for the

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:10,178
axon? Remember, the myelin sheath wraps around the axon. Does it keep it

3
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:14,622
together so the impulse doesn't fall through the cracks? It insulates it making

4
00:00:14,622 --> 00:00:19,536
the neuron more effective, or does it protect it from synapticitis when the

5
00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:22,623
synapse eats the axon?
