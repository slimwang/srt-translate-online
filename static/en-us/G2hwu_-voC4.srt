00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,145
Let's say k was equal to negative 5. Well, I would have the absolute value of

2
00:00:04,157 --> 00:00:08,538
negative 5 is greater than negative 3. So, 5 is greater than negative 3, that's

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,043
true. What if k was negative 1? I'd have the absolute value of negative 1, which

4
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:17,225
is greater than negative 3. Well, the distance of negative 1 to zero is just

5
00:00:17,237 --> 00:00:21,482
positive 1. So, this is true, too. We know any number to the right of zero will

6
00:00:21,494 --> 00:00:25,324
be positive. And, in fact, the absolute value of any number is always greater

7
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:29,064
than or equal to zero. So, this is always true, it doesn't matter what k is. Any

8
00:00:29,076 --> 00:00:32,945
real number would work on our number line. That was a tough question and I hope

9
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:36,934
it got you thinking. Now that we've wrapped up this lesson, try practicing a few

10
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:40,711
problems, and feel free to look back if you need to. Sometimes these concepts

11
00:00:40,723 --> 00:00:41,650
can be challenging.
