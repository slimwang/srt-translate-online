1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,960
Once you've identified
your top few advantages,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,100
there are a few frameworks
you can use to outline them.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,280
We're going to use a grid to map all
your competitors on one slide and

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,870
position you as the leader.

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,800
You're going to create something
like this for your final project.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,900
Let's start by focusing on two
things that you really excel at.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,130
These are your competitive advantages.

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,220
We'll use these to label
the two axes of the grid.

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,990
And we want you to place
your main competitors here.

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,410
But again, you'll be positioned as
the leader, right in this area.

11
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,080
These competitive advantages
can be price versus value,

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,710
or you can write a specific
value to your customer.

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,130
Maybe think of something
that your potential users or

14
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,040
investors would be really,
really interested in, or excited about.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,830
So we'll have to name our
two axes accordingly.

16
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,660
So if it's price,
it will be low price and high price.

17
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,950
Now let's say our value is innovation.

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,195
We can have high innovation and
low innovation.

19
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:57,181
Or you can choose something else.

20
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,760
So for specific and generic,
let's talk about this.

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,700
For Embarkment we started to realize
that the general market was a bit

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,550
crowded.

23
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,078
So we needed to find a unique value to
differentiate our app from, let's say,

24
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:08,908
a dog kennel.

25
00:01:08,908 --> 00:01:11,703
So we decided to focus
on a niche market.

26
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:16,290
And go the same idea, but only for
fancy dogs with the most refined tastes.

27
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,520
We're going to offer high end services.

28
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,720
We'll only accept sitters who have
nice homes and nice backyards.

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,054
Those sitters must take the dogs
on multiple walks a day.

30
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:30,175
And the sitters must only offer
the highest quality food and care for

31
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:30,834
the dogs.

32
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:35,729
For the more refined of Embarkment, we
chose a grid that includes one axis for

33
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,620
quality, let's change that now.

34
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,370
One axis for quality, so
we have high quality and low quality,

35
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,870
and we're going to keep the specific and
generic axis.

36
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,450
So now that we have our grid,
we're going to choose competitors from

37
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,250
the product form category, so
these are our direct competitors.

38
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,150
And we might also find a few
other relevant competitors.

39
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,830
So we have the local kennel,
which is pretty generic.

40
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,780
And the quality's not great, but

41
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,490
sometimes they're associated with vets,
so that's good.

42
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,690
Then we have The Dog House, which is
more specific because they only take

43
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:10,400
dogs, but they're not as specific as we
are, and the quality's not super great.

44
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,540
The don't really vet their sitters.

45
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,930
Then we have Doggie Vacay,
which they are pretty good quality but

46
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,290
they're not as specific as we are.

47
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,770
And finally we have Rover,
who also has great quality,

48
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,500
but they're more generic than we are.

49
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,840
So notice that we're here in
the top right-hand quadrant.

50
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,150
This is the best place to be, and

51
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,820
it really sets us apart from
all of our other competitors.
