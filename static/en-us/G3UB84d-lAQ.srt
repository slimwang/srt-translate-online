00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,745
Here the correct answers were 2 plus or minus i times root 6. That's amazing

2
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:09,829
work if you got these answers correct. We want to start by dividing each term

3
00:00:09,829 --> 00:00:15,250
of our equation by 3. So dividing each of these by 3 we'll get x squared minus

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:21,222
4x plus 10 equals 0. Now we're in a position to complete the square. Our a term

5
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:26,166
is one, and our b term is even. We subtract 10 from both sides to get x squared

6
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:31,154
minus 4x equals negative 10. We complete the square by adding 4 to both sides

7
00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:36,478
of the equation. This gives us the quantity, x minus 2 squared equal to

8
00:00:36,478 --> 00:00:41,428
negative 6. Then, we take the square root of both sides of the equation to get

9
00:00:41,428 --> 00:00:46,860
x minus 2 equals positive or negative i root 6. We add 2 to both sides to solve

10
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,620
for x. And these are the two solutions.
