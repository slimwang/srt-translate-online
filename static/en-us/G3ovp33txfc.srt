Student Kevin Troy asks, weÃ¢ÂÂve seen in this unit

2
00:00:04,228 --> 00:00:06,386
the use of import time to get access to time the

3
00:00:06,386 --> 00:00:09,621
clock. Can you talk about the basics of libraries,

4
00:00:09,621 --> 00:00:11,188
what they are and how they work et cetera?

5
00:00:11,188 --> 00:00:13,121
Okay, this is good because I donÃ¢ÂÂt think I

6
00:00:13,121 --> 00:00:15,549
explained really whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on when I use that.

7
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:19,130
What import does is just bring a library into your

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,242
execution environment, so you can have a

9
00:00:22,242 --> 00:00:25,043
library that defines different variables, defines

10
00:00:25,043 --> 00:00:27,376
functions, defines anything that you would define

11
00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:29,459
in your own Python code and then when you

12
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:32,168
import it you get access to all of that but itÃ¢ÂÂs not

13
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:34,366
in your own file. And having libraries is really

14
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:36,710
useful. It limits the size of the file that you have

15
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,009
to deal with, it protects the name space, so if

16
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:40,682
everything that was defined as part of the

17
00:00:40,682 --> 00:00:43,210
standard library was always available and you

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,108
didnÃ¢ÂÂt have to import it, there would be name,

19
00:00:45,108 --> 00:00:47,435
more names that you have to worry about using

20
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:48,765
because they already have some other

21
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:50,281
predefined meaning.

22
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:52,331
So libraries are really useful. You can make your

23
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:54,978
own libraries, weÃ¢ÂÂre not going to cover that and IÃ¢ÂÂll

24
00:00:54,978 --> 00:00:57,050
see as one-on-one but as you start to build bigger

25
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,267
programs itÃ¢ÂÂs really important to think about how

26
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,796
do you structure your program, so you donÃ¢ÂÂt end

27
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:03,936
up with one huge file with lots of code that no one

28
00:01:03,936 --> 00:01:06,249
can figure out whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on. So libraries are

29
00:01:06,249 --> 00:01:08,135
very useful way to do that.
