1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,470
Now this wasn't just a linear function. This was a cubic function. And its

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,304
inverse is the cubed root of x minus 1. Now that's great work if you found this

3
00:00:10,304 --> 00:00:17,049
solution. Again, we'll start by making f of x by y, our output. Now we're going

4
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:21,510
to switch x and y. Now we have a function that we can solve for y in order to

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,710
find the inverse. Now our goal is to get y alone, so first we'll subtract 1

6
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:33,635
from both sides of the equation, to get x minus 1 equals y cubed. Now we need

7
00:00:33,635 --> 00:00:39,360
to undo this power of 3. Well, I know cube-roots undo a third power. So taking

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,490
the cube-root of both sides of the equation, I'll have one y equal to the

9
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:50,600
cube-root of x minus one. Now, keep in mind this is our inverse function, so we

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,319
take y and replace it with f-inverse of x. Here's our solution.
