1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:04,928
So this is a little demo that I typically do for the people that come here

2
00:00:04,928 --> 00:00:10,371
wondering what previs is all about. Normally, it begins with this kind of

3
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:16,241
simple character that we build from various pieces and texture. We'll just take

4
00:00:16,241 --> 00:00:20,797
that character and rig it up with our special rigging system, but have, we have

5
00:00:20,797 --> 00:00:24,951
it built in segments so that there's no actual skinning going on, so that we

6
00:00:24,951 --> 00:00:32,555
can keep these guys running around very quickly. So then, we'll apply either an

7
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:37,703
animation cycle we've created or something that we do from the, from the motion

8
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:44,829
capture. And so of course, then, you can go and give this guy a friend. And

9
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:49,480
this is how we begin to build up the sequence. And then the director will start

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,565
to ask, okay, where are they standing, where is, what's the environment? So, we

11
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:59,872
end up building this whole location to scale. So actually, when you go all the

12
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:03,902
way out, you see that this is topographically accurate, it's the real scale of

13
00:01:03,902 --> 00:01:09,590
the real environment. So that, if the director wants to look in any different

14
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:15,510
direction, they're seeing the correct heights of all of the landmarks. Then,

15
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,030
I'll just add a few effects to this particular shot, required some

16
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:24,280
pyrotechnics. So, we actually ended up going and consulting with the

17
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,194
pyrotechnics guys to make sure that the, the scale of the, of the explosions

18
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:35,416
was correct. So even though, they're just a bunch of still images, we end up

19
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:41,146
getting the accurate scale of what these, the explosions would be. But, the

20
00:01:41,146 --> 00:01:44,684
first thing that I need to do before it becomes a shot is actually look at it

21
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:50,394
through a camera. So here, the guys running through the shot, this is how we

22
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:59,220
initially composed the scene. And then we decided, you know what, let's do an

23
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:06,911
alternate angle. So, we just quickly threw in another, another view. And this

24
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:10,627
is the same action, but played out as just a pan tilt as opposed to a dolly

25
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:15,300
shot. So you can get a lot of, create different camera moves out of the same

26
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,635
action. Next up I want to show you how we add some extra realism to the camera

27
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:27,020
itself. First of all, we select the camera, and then we have all kinds of

28
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:32,499
controls. in this case, I'm going to turn on the handheld control. And I can

29
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:36,854
amp this up, so that now, instantly, I see the same action but with a bit more

30
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:42,810
shake on it, so it feels more realistic. Especially great for these kinds of

31
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,463
action sequences. Once the scenes are approved, we end up taking a look at this

32
00:02:47,463 --> 00:02:53,750
from a completely different perspective. Can we actually do this shot? And in

33
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,370
the case of this particular shot, they decided, well, let's just start shooting

34
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:04,301
this on a green screen. And so, how this actually works is, we can take a look

35
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:11,006
in my at the volume of the sound stage. And we brought in of course, all of the

36
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:17,413
gear, the, the lights, the, the camera equipment. So, when we're looking at the

37
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:22,110
shot on set we can make sure that we have the right-sized green screen, and

38
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:29,260
that all of the technical pieces are working. Now you'll notice here in the

39
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,290
beginning that one of the actors is stepping on this kind of red dolly track

40
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:39,650
that we have there. So, what we need to do is make sure that kind of move this

41
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:47,056
over and we can, we can place that wherever we need it to be. And our camera

42
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:53,008
rigs work in reverse. So right now, this is giving me a certain solution. It's

43
00:03:53,008 --> 00:04:00,138
all driven by the creative camera, but the actual rig just follows along. So if

44
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:04,493
I wanted to take this rig, and in my change the trajectory of the rig, I could

45
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:11,332
scoot it over this way so it's out of the shot. The, creatively, the shot is

46
00:04:11,332 --> 00:04:15,493
going to be the same, but, at least we know now where best to put all of the

47
00:04:15,493 --> 00:04:20,774
gear. So, the last part of the story here is, once we've got the creative

48
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:24,556
worked out, we've got a plan for how to shoot it effectively, then we need to

49
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:31,636
make sure that we communicate that to the clients. So we give them all these

50
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:37,360
different views and usually encapsulated into one particular drawing. a page

51
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,715
that we can give to the production managers or the producers, so that they can

52
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:48,010
keep track of how each of these shots was created digitally. But it's not to

53
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,640
take anything away from what the real cinematographers would do when they step

54
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,695
on onto the set. But at least, that they've brought the right camera crane, the

55
00:04:56,695 --> 00:05:00,325
all of the gear that they need to make sure that they effectively have all the

56
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:03,430
tools to produce the shot.
