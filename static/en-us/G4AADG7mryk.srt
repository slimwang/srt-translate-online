00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,311
Kyle gave us all this rectangle code but why are you so sure that Kyle's code

2
00:00:03,311 --> 00:00:08,375
works? Now it's your turn to write a test program for the grill method. If you

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:14,017
create a rectangle like this with an upper left corner, at 45, 90 and a width

4
00:00:14,017 --> 00:00:21,592
of 60 and a height of 90. Let's say you call it box and you call grow with 20

5
00:00:21,592 --> 00:00:27,670
and 20. So it should grow 20 in this direction, 20 in this direction, 20 in

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:44,121
this direction, and 20 in this direction. What are the actual and expected

7
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:46,013
values of x, y width and height? Write a test program that compares those

8
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:46,854
expected values with the actual values.
