1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:06,308
The outputs of f for each of these inputs are each of these numbers, 1, 2, 4,

2
00:00:06,308 --> 00:00:11,940
8, 16 and 32. These are just the numbers we get when we plug in each of these

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,579
values for x in 2 to the x. That means that on our function f of x equals 2 to

4
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:22,310
the x, we have the points 0,1, 1,2, 2,4 and so on. And that also means that for

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:31,440
the function f inverse, we have the opposite points, 1,0, 2,1, 4,2 and so on.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,416
We're definitely learning a lot about these two functions and how they're

7
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,429
related.
