00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,929
Now let's think about what another graph that we've already seen before looked

2
00:00:02,929 --> 00:00:08,615
like in general. Here's y equals x cubed. A very basic cubic function. Now on

3
00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:12,135
the left hand side over here, is the graph of this function coming down from up

4
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:17,162
high or is it coming up from down low? And on the right is it rising up high or

5
00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:19,249
is it falling down low?
