00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,569
In the previous video, you saw that you could use this graph by checking the y

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:08,597
values and reading off the corresponding x values to find different points. But

3
00:00:08,597 --> 00:00:12,255
wouldn't it be easier if the value that we've been using for y were actually

4
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:17,720
the input and the value we were reading off was the output instead? We actually

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,713
already know about this sort of thing. Which of these terms down here best

6
00:00:20,713 --> 00:00:25,060
describes what we're looking for? Is it the composition of B of t, the inverse

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,426
of B of t, the reflection of B of t in the y-axis, the reflection of B of t in

8
00:00:29,426 --> 00:00:36,610
the x-axis, or the y-intercept of B of t? Please consider this the x-axis and

9
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,969
this the y-axis for the purposes of this question.
