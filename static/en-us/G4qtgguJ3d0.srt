1
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:10,340
And the answers are 10, 19 and 23. Let's look at A. We have to move nine steps.

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,810
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight nine, and over here, we have

3
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:20,831
to turn right, which costs us one so the total is going to be ten. For B,

4
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:22,416
there's two ways to get there. We can

5
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:25,564
go straight and left, which will be 6 steps,

6
00:00:25,564 --> 00:00:28,226
but we've got to pay a cost of 14, for

7
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:31,520
a total of 20. It turns out it'lll be cheaper

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,488
to take the loop over here and do three right

9
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:37,950
turns, which is a total of 16 steps, and we have

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,250
three right turns, which gives us 19. For C, it

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,760
turns, there are multiple of ways to get there. You can

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,240
go straight, turn left over here. Straight, turn left over

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,740
here and go around here, which looks inferior. Or, do the

14
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,275
right turn trick again, but now this time do five right turns to

15
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:58,970
get to C. When you work it out, you find that going straight

16
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,920
and turning left is the cheapest. These are nine steps, and we pay the cost of a

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,049
left turn, which is 14, adds up to 23.
