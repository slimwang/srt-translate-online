1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,940
Two level memories appear everywhere.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,520
So I want you to tell me which of
the following are examples of slow and

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,590
fast memory pairings?

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:09,990
Here are your options.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,380
As an example,
the first option is hard disk,

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,250
as the slow memory, versus main memory,
as the fast memory.

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,380
In fact, I already gave you this one so
let's check it off.

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,240
The other pairings are L1
cash versus CPU registers,

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,590
tape storage versus the hard disk,
remote server RAM versus local server

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,360
RAM, the Internet versus your brain,
and I've even left you an additional

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,560
option if you want to be creative and
come up with your own.
