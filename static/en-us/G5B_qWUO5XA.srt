1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,692
So, a couple conclusions about RANSAC.

2
00:00:02,692 --> 00:00:07,810
The good, it is simple and general, it is used often.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,550
It's applicable to many different problems.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,090
It is robust, even with respect to a very large number of outliers,

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,980
that's really the key element.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,700
And, it is not sensitive to the number of points that are in the, in,

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,470
in the system.

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,230
We had you do the Hough transform, and those of you doing the OMS,

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,240
you're going to do the RANSAC as well.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,020
I will tell you that in general it's easier to get RANSAC to

11
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,070
work than Hough transforms.

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,100
The parameters are little more finicky than in a Hough.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,540
And for large numbers of parameters RANSAC just means to take lots more samples.

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,140
And it goes up kind of painfully, but not awfully.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,620
If you remember Hough transform the space complexity goes up

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,030
cominetorically in number of parameters.

17
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,770
And these days it's easier to deal with things that require you to be fast, but

18
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,030
not big.

19
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,140
And so, RANSAC you have to be fast as the numbers go up.

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,580
In, in Hough the, the memory size gets larger.

21
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,360
So, in general, making RANSAC work is easier.

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,590
The not-so-good, I don't want to say the bad, because Barney and

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,300
Bob are good friends of mine.

24
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,180
But actually, there's a huge body of work on RANSAC and

25
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,810
all its derivatives from that.

26
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,820
It's, it's just one of the most fundamental algorithms in computer vision.

27
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,200
The computational time grows quickly, with the number of parameters.

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,250
That was the s, the size of the minimal set.

29
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,890
Not, not awfully, awfully but you know, when you start to

30
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,840
get more than ten you're going to be wishing you were less than ten.

31
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,040
It's a little bit challenging if you've got like multiple plains, and

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,840
you wanted to full, find out each of them.

33
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:42,860
You have to be a lot,

34
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,830
then you have to be a lot more careful with your thresholds.

35
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,750
So it's not as good at multiple fits.

36
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,450
It's really not so great for approximate models, right?

37
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,970
So it, suppose it's kind of a plane, but not really a plane.

38
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,150
That's a problem, because now you pulled out some points.

39
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,710
And where it's not quite, it, it, you know,

40
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,120
fit a plane, it's not quite the right plane anymore.

41
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,300
So it can be kind of sensitive to when your model doesn't really match,

42
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,150
the underlying structure of what's out there.

43
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,860
I will tell you that it's used all the time for

44
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,290
doing things like, it says homogra, any sorts of image transforms.

45
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,180
It's also used often for

46
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:25,790
doing understanding relative views such as fundamental matrices.

47
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,790
And generally it's used for pretty much every problem in robot vision.

48
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,230
It's amazing to me.

49
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,200
affect, I see bubbles, on some occasion, and you know, I keep

50
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,340
reminding him that you know, I wish I had an algorithm that I see used just, so

51
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,940
often these days, because it, it is a fundamental algorithm for robot vision.
