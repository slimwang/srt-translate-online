1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,265
And the answer is 12,960,000 because you have to compare every single pixel in

2
00:00:05,265 --> 00:00:12,558
one image with every single pixel in the other. So it's 72 times 72 times 50

3
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:18,178
times 50. This is clearly insane, now we only have two objects and we're all

4
00:00:18,178 --> 00:00:24,034
ready doing way, way too much work. So, instead of computing the intersection

5
00:00:24,034 --> 00:00:27,692
between every single pixel and every other pixel in the world, we'll use an

6
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:33,548
approximation of our pixel shape, which simplifies our collision calculations.

7
00:00:33,548 --> 00:00:37,940
And we'll do this by representing each object as a box and this is called an

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,460
access aligned bounding box or AABB for short.
