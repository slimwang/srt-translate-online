1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,810
To begin, you'll want to
identify the target languages and

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:03,950
locales for your app.

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,730
You can manage your app in three main
dimensions, country, locale, and

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,660
language.

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,610
Language is the key consideration for
localization, but

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,700
locale is significant to format dates,
times, currencies, and such.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,720
Users control what the language and
locale used on their Android device is,

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,050
and those affect how your
app will be displayed.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,790
After you've identified your targets,
you can focus your development,

10
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,800
translation, testing, and
marketing efforts to these markets.
