00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:04,774
To understand why the GPU is such an interesting processor today, we'll start with technology trends.

2
00:00:04,774 --> 00:00:06,507
Why the world has gone parallel.

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,387
And first, we'll start with some good news.

4
00:00:08,387 --> 00:00:10,889
Modern processors are made from transistors.

5
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,050
Each year those transistors get smaller and smaller.

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:18,093
This graph is from Stanford's CPUDB project. Thanks, guys.

7
00:00:18,093 --> 00:00:21,725
What it shows is the feature size of processors over time,

8
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:25,495
where the feature size is the minimum size of a transistor or wire on a chip.

9
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:28,699
So what we're seeing is this is time going in this direction.

10
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:31,541
That's a long time ago and that's today.

11
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,638
This is the feature size, so how big transistors are.

12
00:00:34,638 --> 00:00:38,079
Notice that it's getting smaller and smaller every generation.

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,272
When you hear talk about 45 nanometer process or a 22 nanometer

14
00:00:42,272 --> 00:00:44,713
that's what we're referring to, the feature size.

15
00:00:44,713 --> 00:00:47,682
We see that it's consistently going down over time.

16
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:52,385
As the feature size decreases, transistors get smaller, run faster, use less power,

17
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,889
and we can put more of them on a chip.

18
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:58,660
The consequence is that we have more and more resources for computation every single year.

19
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,935
However, we've also got some bad news.

20
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:04,498
Historically, as transistors improved, processor designers would then

21
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:08,269
increase the clock rates of processors, running them faster and faster every year.

22
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:12,004
Let's take a look at this diagram of clock speeds over the years.

23
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:17,170
So again, we have time going on this axis, okay? So, a long time ago, today.

24
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,568
Here we have clock frequencyâ€”how fast we're clocking these transistors.

25
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:26,206
Historically, one of the primary drivers of clock performance has been clock speed increases.

26
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:30,310
We see over many years, we see clock speeds continue to go up.

27
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,748
However, over the last decade we see that clock speeds have essentially remained constant.
