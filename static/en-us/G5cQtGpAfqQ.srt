00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,500
Before describing the technical
requirements for virtualization,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,960
let's take a look at
the Two Main Virtualization Models.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,899
The two popular models for
virtualization are called Bare-metal or

4
00:00:11,899 --> 00:00:14,300
Hypervisor-based and Hosted.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,866
They are also often referred to as (type
1) for the Hypervisor-based model and

6
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:23,140
(type 2) for the Hosted model for
virtualization solutions.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,030
The Bare-metal model is like
what we illustrated before.

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,820
A virtual machine monitor or
hypervisor is responsible for

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,070
the management of
the physical resources, and

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,310
it supports execution of
entire virtual machine.

11
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,200
One issue with this model are devices.

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,700
According to the model, the hypervisor
must manage all possible devices, or

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:52,340
stated differently, device manufacturers
now have to provide the device drivers,

14
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,380
not just for the different
operating systems, but also for

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,820
the different hypervisors
that are out there.

16
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,870
To illuminate this,

17
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,390
the hypervisor model typically
integrates a special virtual machine.

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,790
Like a service VM that runs
a standard operating system and

19
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,500
has full hardware privileges to
access and perform any kind of

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,420
hardware manipulation just like if
you were in need of BMV hardware.

21
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,920
It is this privilege VM then that would
run all of the device drivers and

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,450
would have control over how
the devices on the platform are used.

23
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,950
The service VM also runs some
other management tasks and

24
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,820
configuration tasks that specifies
exactly how the hypervisor

25
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,050
would share the resources across
the guest VMs, for instance.

26
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,788
This model is adapted by the Xen
virtualization solution,

27
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:47,550
as, and also by the VMware's hypervisor,
the ESX hypervisor.

28
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,260
Regarding Xen, both when it comes
to the open source version,

29
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,360
as well as the version that's
supported by Citrix, the Xen server.

30
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,730
The VMs that are run in the virtualized
environment are referred to as domains.

31
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,580
The privileged domain is called dom 0,
and

32
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,095
the guest VMs are referred to as domUs.

33
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,620
Xen is the actual hypervisor and

34
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,130
all of the drivers are running in
the privileged domain, in dom 0.

35
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,710
So the management of all of
the devices has to involve

36
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,468
the execution of the drivers
that are part of dom 0.

37
00:02:21,468 --> 00:02:25,790
Given that VMware and
its hypervisors were first to market,

38
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,490
VMware still owns the largest
percentage of virtualized server cores.

39
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,088
So these server cores
run the ESX hypervisor.

40
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:38,990
Even this fact, viewers in
a position to actually mandate

41
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:44,030
from the vendors that they do provide
the drivers for the different devices.

42
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,960
That are going to be
part of the hypervisor.

43
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,270
Now, this is not as bad because this
is really targeting the server.

44
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,140
Part of the market space and

45
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,040
in servers in data centers there not
going to be that many devices or

46
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,200
there are going to be relatively
a fewer devices compared to what

47
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,540
you would see on your laptop or desktops
or in general the client platforms.

48
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,610
To support a third party community
of developers VMware actually also

49
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,930
exports a number of APIs.

50
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,590
So this not just for
the sake of the developers, but

51
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,520
also for users when they want to
configure exactly the kinds of policies

52
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,180
that will be enforced by the hypervisor.

53
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,680
And in the past the ESX architecture
was such that there was

54
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,270
a control core,
a core domain, if you will,

55
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,462
that was based on a regular operating
system, it was based on Linux.

56
00:03:35,462 --> 00:03:36,240
But the right now,

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,820
all of the configuration related
tasks are configured via remote APIs.
