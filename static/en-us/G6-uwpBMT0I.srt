1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:07,450
So for the Move ScrollBar action,
we will see, or the other things

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,540
that'll be involved is that the handle
itself will move, but at the same time,

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,430
we're going to need to get a new
sequence of lines from our file manager.

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,460
>> So let's imagine we're scrolling up,
and we would expect to

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,400
see some subsequent lines in the file
appear at the bottom of the screen.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,960
How about the width of the scroll bar
handle, or do we expect that to change?

7
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,510
>> The width of the scroll-
>> The height.

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,540
>> No, I don't think so
unless we're resizing the window.

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,840
>> Okay,
then how about going on to the resize.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,930
>> Right, and I guess that would be one
of the first things that would have to

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:49,050
happen, is when you resize the window,
the size of your handle can change.

12
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:56,426
It may also move
the position of the handle.

13
00:00:56,426 --> 00:01:00,710
So like if you had the handle
at the bottom of Viewport and

14
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,310
you start bringing the Viewport up,
then it's going to kind of gradually,

15
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,520
I guess that's part of moving the view,
or changing the Viewport size as well so

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,840
these kinds of things
are all working together.

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,410
>> Right, okay.

18
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,820
And we might need to see some
additional lines of the file.

19
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,690
>> Right, right.

20
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,160
>> Ultimately, each of those responses

21
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,039
represents a relationship between
the corresponding components.
