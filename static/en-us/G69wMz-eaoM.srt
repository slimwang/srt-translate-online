1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,816
I've given you several functions written out here. And for each of these

2
00:00:03,816 --> 00:00:07,848
functions, I'd like you to identify the name of the function, the input of the

3
00:00:07,848 --> 00:00:11,920
function, and the output of the function, in terms of the input value. So I've

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,258
already filled in how you would do this for this first function. Which we would

5
00:00:16,258 --> 00:00:22,826
read as h of t, equals negative 9.8t squared. So here you can see that the name

6
00:00:22,826 --> 00:00:28,255
of the function is h, the input is t, and the output is this expression over

7
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:33,555
here. Now you have 9.8t squared. So please fill in all of these boxes for the

8
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:34,791
other 2 functions.
