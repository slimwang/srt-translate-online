1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,270
What we would like to
build is a procedure for

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,830
reducing a system of equations
to a simple a form as possible.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,450
Ideally, finding the unique
solution of a system if it exists.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,940
We'll start by informally
describing the procedure and

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,340
using it to solve some
example systems of equations.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,630
Then we'll explore some special cases
that can occur during the algorithm.

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,400
Once we have a better intuition about
the algorithm then we'll begin to write

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,850
code which will define
the algorithm's precise operation.

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,050
The algorithm we will discuss is
a classic algorithm called Gaussian

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,280
elimination.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,760
Though it is named after the nineteenth
century German mathematician,

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,290
Carl Gauss.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,150
The algorithm was known to the Chinese
as early as the second century BCE.

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,990
The basic idea of Gaussian elimination
is to gradually clear variables and

15
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,820
successive equations.

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,220
So the first equation will have
all the variables x, y, and z.

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,850
Then the next equation will
end up with just y and z.

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,610
And then the last equation
will just have z.

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,920
That way the last equation just
becomes z equals some number and

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,790
then since the second
equation only has y and

21
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,740
z and we know the value of z,
this allows us to find the value of y.

22
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,600
Finally, we use the values of y and

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,910
z in the first equation to find
the value of x, giving us the solution.

24
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,770
Presuming there is a unique solution,
after all.

25
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,160
We can do this by adding or

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,950
subtracting appropriate amounts of an
equation from all equations underneath.

27
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,060
Let's look at this example system.

28
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,905
x-3y+z = 4.

29
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:43,550
-3x+9y+z = 0 and y-z = 1.

30
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:47,910
In order to clear the x term
from the second equation,

31
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,860
we can add to three times the first
equation and to the second.

32
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,000
Remember that adding or

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,720
subtracting multiples of
equations is a valid operation.

34
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,000
This transforms the second
equation into 4z = 12.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,540
Now we could go ahead and use the second
equation to find the value of z.

36
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,780
But for now we're going to ignore
the short cut and show how the procedure

37
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,150
works in general like we did before
with the x term in the first equation.

38
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,990
We want there to be a y term
in the second equation,

39
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,450
so that we can use it to clear y
terms below the second equation.

40
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,820
That way we have successive
loss of variables.

41
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,370
If like in this case, there is no
y term in the second equation,

42
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,250
we look to below the second equation for
one with a y term.

43
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,390
Then we can swap the second equation for
the equation with the y term.

44
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,100
In this case,
we'll swap equations two and

45
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,770
three to get a y term in the second row.

46
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,350
Again, this is one of our
valid equation operations.

47
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,900
Now the second equation is y-z = 1.

48
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,910
And the third equation is 4z = 12.

49
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,450
We have no y terms underneath
the second equation so

50
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,130
there are no more terms to clear.

51
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,660
Finally, since we're
at the bottom equation

52
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,330
there are no terms underneath
the z term in the third equation.

53
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,730
Notice that our system of equations
is in a special form each variable

54
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,410
that appears as a leading term doesn't
appear in any further equations.

55
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,630
this form is sometimes
given a special name,

56
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,770
such as triangular form or
row echelon form.

57
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,690
In this lesson we will
call it triangular form.

58
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,980
However, this system does not
represent the same set of planes

59
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,630
as the system we started with by
adding and subtracting equations.

60
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,290
We do change the planes involved.

61
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,640
However, we have changed
them in such a way.

62
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,500
That the common intersections
of the planes remains the same.

63
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,610
Once we've reached triangular form,
our next task is to clear upwards.

64
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,550
So that way we isolate each
variable in its own equation.

65
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,480
First, we're going to solve for

66
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,610
z in the bottom equation by
multiplying it through by one-fourth.

67
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:02,310
Notice that this is the third equation
operation we had defined earlier.

68
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,926
This gives us the bottom
equation now reading z = 3.

69
00:04:05,926 --> 00:04:11,120
To clear upwards we can add the third
equation to the second equation.

70
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,960
This makes the second
equation become y = 4.

71
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:22,099
Then subtracting the third equation from
the first equation gives us x-3y = 1.

72
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:26,200
Notice that z is now in its own column.

73
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,438
Now let's focus on y,
we've already solved for y, y = 4.

74
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:37,020
So the last step is to clear upwards so
that y is also in its own column.

75
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,350
To do this, we add three times
the second equation to the first

76
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,320
which makes the first
equation become x = 13.

77
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,590
Using just the three operations
we spelled out earlier

78
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,850
we have found the sole point of
intersection of the three planes

79
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,400
described in the original
system of equations.

80
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,920
Note that we can check
that the point 13, 4,

81
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,234
3 satisfies all three equations
in the original system.

82
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:08,447
I'd like to run through this set
of operations one more time but

83
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:13,793
this time including a plot of the three
planes that these equations represent.

84
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:18,014
That way you can see visually what
Gaussian elimination is doing.

85
00:05:18,014 --> 00:05:22,399
One thing to keep in mind is that
the common intersection of the planes

86
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,256
defined by these three equations
should never change during

87
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:28,650
our operations that we use.

88
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,990
After the first operation, notice that
the green plane has rotated along its

89
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,650
intersection line with the red plane and
is now entirely horizontal.

90
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,780
The second operation,

91
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:44,010
which swaps two equations, just changes
the color of two of the planes.

92
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:49,400
The third operation, which multiplies
equation three by one-fourth,

93
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,940
doesn't change the blue plane at all.

94
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,470
By adding the third equation
to the second equation and

95
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,990
isolating the y variable.

96
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:04,360
The green plane which is y = 4, is now
perfectly orthogonal to the y axis.

97
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,160
Next, clearing the z variable
from the first equation

98
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,220
means that the red plane no longer
has any dependency on the z variable.

99
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,480
Finally, eliminating the y
variable from the first equation

100
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,630
makes the read plane perfectly
orthogonal to the x axis and

101
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,240
now the meeting point of the three
planes is easily identifiable.
