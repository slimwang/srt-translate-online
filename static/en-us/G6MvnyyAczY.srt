1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,880
This is actually a really hard question,
and probably way too unfair for a quiz.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,660
Yeah, I'm a jerk like that.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,770
So I would say that your best
bets are the hypercube and

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,620
fully connected networks.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,590
Here's my thought process.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,220
An all to all is intrinsically
bi-section, limited.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,460
So, of these choices,
only hypercubes and

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,030
fully connected networks have
linear bi-section widths or better.

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,620
That's what you would need to knock down
this bandwidth term from being linear in

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,790
P, to something that is logarithmic
in P, or maybe even constant.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,870
Okay, so that's not a rigorous proof
that these are the right answers,

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,190
it's just an intuitive idea.

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,760
So, what I'll do is I'll put some
pointers in the instructor's notes where

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,490
you can do a little bit more
reading if you're interested.

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,360
I know you'll be interested,
because if you do the reading,

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,020
Mr Tofu will give you a cupcake.

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,910
This cupcake is for you,
Mr Tofu wants to give you a cupcake.
