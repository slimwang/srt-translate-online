When thinking about graph algorithms
in the distributed setting,

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,540
it will often be very helpful to look
at a graph as an adjacency matrix.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,400
Now, if you haven't seen that before or
you just need a refresher,

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,780
here's a crash course on how it works.

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,980
Start by giving each
vertex an integer label.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,090
Next, create a matrix to
represent this graph.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,630
Let's call it A, with row and
one column for every vertex.

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,310
Now for any edge that goes
from a source vertex i,

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:30,420
to a destination vertex j,
we'll put a one in the ij entry of a.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,260
Otherwise, if an entry is empty,
assume that it has a value of zero,

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,600
which means no edge.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,830
For instance,
let's start with vertex zero.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,220
It's adjacent to vertices one and five.

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:47,040
So, let's go to row zero and
place ones at entry one and entry five.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,180
Now, this graph is undirected,
so both rows one and

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,540
row five will also have
a one in column zero.

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,390
Put another way, the matrix for
an undirected graph is symmetric.

18
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,340
In linear algebraic terms,
we say A is equal to A transpose.

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,600
Now, let's do the same thing for
vertex one.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,570
It's adjacent to vertices one,
two, and six.

21
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,090
So let's mark those entries of A.

22
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,560
And of course we'll update
the symmetric image.

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,010
When you're all done you
should get this matrix.

24
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,780
In general consider any
undirected graph, call it G.

25
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,430
Let's suppose that it has n as in Nancy
vertices and m as in Michael edges.

26
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,210
It's adjacency matrix will be n by n.

27
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,594
And since it's undirected, it will
be symmetric with two m non-zeroes.
