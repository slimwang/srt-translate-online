00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,450
Task queues allows you to take the job offline, so

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,750
you can create the task queue and then add a

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,580
hundred task that each has the job to send a

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,360
hundred emails. Tasks can be created for many user activity,

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,540
and be put on this queue. And as we will

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,690
see later, these tasks are not executed in the user

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,790
request strip. So you can immediately return a response to

8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,490
the user, but one question remains then. How will these

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,670
mails be sent? That actually depends on the type of queue you use. But before we

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,210
go into that, it's time for you to answer a question. So the question is which

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,390
is best to use, the HTTP request thread

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,160
or task queues? When you want to generate

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,410
the report, or register a new user, checking

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,330
out the shopping cart, or do photo face recognition?
