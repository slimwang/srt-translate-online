Going through all the steps of the quadratic formula gives us 9, plus or minus

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,353
i. Or, in other words, our zeroes are 9 plus i and 9 minus i. Interesting. So I

00:00:10,353 --> 00:00:14,700
guess that cubic functions, like the one we started out with, can have

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,530
imaginary zeros too. That's pretty cool. Think for a second about what this

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,100
means for the graph of Grant's profit function.
