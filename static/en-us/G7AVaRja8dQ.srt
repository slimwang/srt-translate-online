00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,608
Starting out with our function, f of x equals 2x minus 3 over 5. I've gone

2
00:00:05,608 --> 00:00:08,109
through the same steps that you've become very familiar with during this

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:13,490
lesson. First, I switched from f of x to y to make a notation easier to handle.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,852
Then, to switch to the inverse function, I interchanged x and y. So instead, we

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:24,740
have the function, x equals 2y minus 3 over 5. Then I went through a few stuffs

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,673
to solves for y. Getting y by itself on one side gave is the equation 5x plus 3

7
00:00:29,673 --> 00:00:35,375
over 2 equals y. Then I just switched the two sides of the equation and changed

8
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:42,130
y to f inverse of x. That gives us a final equation of f inverse of x equals 5x

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:48,434
plus 3 over 2. Let's double check that this is the right answer. Remember, we

10
00:00:48,434 --> 00:00:52,430
can do that by looking at the composition of f inverse and f and the

11
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:59,986
composition of f and f inverse. f of f inverse affects is 2 times the quantity

12
00:00:59,986 --> 00:01:07,344
5x plus 3 over 2 minus 3, all over 5. Let's simplify this and sure enough, we

13
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:12,185
end up with x. Let's try the composition, the other way around. For f inverse

14
00:01:12,185 --> 00:01:20,530
of f of x, we have 5 times the quantity 2x minus 3 over 5, plus 3 all over 2.

15
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,177
And sure enough, cleaning this up, we get x as well. We've now verified that f

16
00:01:25,177 --> 00:01:30,634
inverse of x really is this expression. 5x plus 3 over 2. I hope at this point

17
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:34,583
you feel really comfortable finding the inverses of different functions. And

18
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:39,082
then checking that they actually are their inverses. Remember this also means

19
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:43,674
that not only is 5x plus 3 over 2 the inverse of 2x minus 3 over 5, but 2x

20
00:01:43,674 --> 00:01:51,160
minus 3 over 5 is also the inverse of this function. They're inverses of one

21
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,824
another. It's a two-way relationship.
