1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,390
The highest level of guarantee, also the one that's hardest to provide,

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,610
is called the quality of service guarantee.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,380
In these guarantees, non-functional requirements are addressed,

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,160
such as availability, mean time between failures,

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,810
mean time to repair, throughput, latency, data integrity, and capacity.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,870
Such an example of such a guarantee would be that the component operates with

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,353
a throughput of some number of transactions given in a, in a given time period.
