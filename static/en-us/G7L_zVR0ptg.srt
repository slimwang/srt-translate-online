00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,610
Another refinement of associa, of associations that I mentioned, is qualifiers.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,760
Qualifiers are indicated by small rectangles, that are on the sides or

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:16,090
edges of class rectangles. The small rectangles contain the name of

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:21,740
one of the attributes, of that particular class. The attribute within the small

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:28,290
rectangle is the qualifier, that can provide access to, instances

6
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:33,430
of that particular class. If you were doing a relational database model you

7
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:39,246
would think of the qualifier as the key, into the set of the instances.

8
00:00:39,246 --> 00:00:45,130
In the leftmost example here, we have bank,

9
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,690
and the account number is the qualifier. Note also that there's some

10
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:56,600
multiplicity information, that a person can have any number of bank accounts,

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,950
for example. On the right, we have the situation with a chessboard and

12
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,370
its squares. How would we identify a particular square? In this case,

13
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,180
we're going to use a pair of attributes, giving the rank and the file of

14
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,070
the particular squares within the chessboard. Notice also that in the chessboard

15
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,920
situation, we have a, a composition. Notice the filled black diamond.
