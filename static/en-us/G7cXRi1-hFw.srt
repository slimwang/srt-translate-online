00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,200
How would you use planning to develop an agent that can

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,630
answer Raven's progressive matrices? So, the first question you want to ask here

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,570
is what are our states? What's our initial state? And what's our final state?

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,120
Given that, what are the operators that allow the transition between them.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,070
How would we select those operators?

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,710
We are talking about partial ordering planning in this lesson,

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,920
what conflicts are possible when we are trying to solve Raven's problems?

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,440
How would we detect those conflicts beforehand and avoid them? Note that again

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,020
we can consider this at two different levels. First, we can think of the agent

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,640
as having a plan for how to address any new problem that comes in. Or second, we

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,640
can consider the agent as discerning the underlying plan behind a new problem.
