1
00:00:00,755 --> 00:00:02,880
Press can help you achieve
your goals quickly.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,670
You'll want to have writers and

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,220
tech magazines mentioning you to help
spread the word about your products.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,050
If you can, getting a tweet, a public
donation, or a mention from a relevent

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,830
celebrity or peer leader who supports
your product can be a huge help.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,240
Working with a peer firm
can be expensive, but

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,580
might be worth considering.

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,490
If you have a big bang launch,
like a KickStarter campaign or

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,362
any other specific launch date that
you want to create a big buzz around.

10
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:30,180
PR firms can help you get
big names supporters or

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,710
celebrities to promote your business.

12
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,612
However, if it's too early for
your start up to spend budget on PR,

13
00:00:36,612 --> 00:00:38,403
you can always do it yourself.

14
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:41,542
If you choose to do it yourself,
you will want to start by writing

15
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,694
a paragraph that you
like writers to write,

16
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:46,037
if you could have them
write whatever you want.

17
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:49,654
This will help you clearly identify
how you want your company to be

18
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:51,450
presented in the press.

19
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,835

an article on tips on how to do this.

20
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:59,125
And lets see what Tali Saar has to
say about PR in the early stages of

21
00:00:59,125 --> 00:00:59,915
a start up.

22
00:00:59,915 --> 00:01:04,209
>> Hi, I'm Tali Saar,
I'm the founder and CEO of Rooster.

23
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,780
Before starting Rooster,
I spent four years at Google.

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,010
I was on the marketing team and

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,300
I was part of the founding team that
started a program called Google Engage,

26
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,130
which developed today into Google
Partners, which is a global program.

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,260
I left Google, I came to Silicon Valley,
and I was first employee for

28
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,860
a start up called Honey Book.

29
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,700
And then I started my company
Rooster a year and a half ago.

30
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,930
Rooster is a pay it forward movement.

31
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,690
We're building a local network that
brings people together to help, borrow,

32
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,460
and share with one another completely
for free in their local communities.

33
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,440
So the idea is you join Rooster in your
location, and you create a profile,

34
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,330
you have your real identity there,
and then the rules are you can ask for

35
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,630
whatever you need and help whenever
you can, but it has to be for free.

36
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,530
So people use it to hand down used
furniture and items they don't need,

37
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,890
like sofas, TVs, art supplies.

38
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,430
They borrow baseball bats and baby cribs
from one another, they walk each other's

39
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,120
dogs, they help each other fix their
bike chains and things like that.

40
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,950
We're currently launched in three cities
with thousands of users, and a lot of

41
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,750
them use it daily and meet each other,
and have all these great experiences.

42
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,130
Starting with PR with low budget.

43
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,264
It's funny a lot of start ups operate
under the assumption that doing PR

44
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,988
is this really complicated thing, and

45
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:14,967
you have to build personal connections
with all the reporters, and

46
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:17,911
you have to be in the scene so
that they'll want to write about you.

47
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:21,496
In my experience, not true at all.

48
00:02:21,496 --> 00:02:27,000
PR and journalists,
their job is to get these stories.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,740
And all you need to do is
understand their world and

50
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,550
where they're coming from and

51
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,120
know how to pitch them, and have
an interesting story to tell, right?

52
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,820
So you want to have a product
that's interesting enough,

53
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,810
you want to have some kind traction,
or some kind of story,

54
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,790
something that you know, can make a news
story and you'll know when you have it.

55
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,150
And then you just want to be very
thoughtful of the journalists' time.

56
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,750
So you want to research who your
journalists are that cover your space

57
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,470
that will potentially
be interested in this.

58
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,330
Don't go and
pitch a thousand irrelevant people.

59
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,420
And once you have those people,
just write in a very clear and

60
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,870
concise way and just consider that
they're getting hundreds of emails per

61
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,150
day and you have to grab
their attention first, right?

62
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,460
So just write a very compelling title,
write a very clear and concise pitch

63
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,215
about why this would be interesting
to them and just go and do it.

64
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:13,965
Go and reach out to all these people,
and in my experience,

65
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:17,725
I got great stories in local press and
in the tech countries of the world,

66
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:21,375
and everywhere I wanted just by giving
the right person the right story.
