1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Narrator] So, in this class you will learn about particle filters.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In our sequence of algorithms for estimating the state of a system,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
this is the third one and in many ways is the best one.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's the easiest to program

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and in most ways is the most flexible.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And to understand why I'm saying this let me start

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
with a little quiz that goes back into the first 2 classes.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In class 1, we learned about histogram filters,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in class 2 about kalman filters,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and we even had to prove there.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Today, I'll teach you about particle filters,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
but we can't really know about particle filters quite yet.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So, my questions will only pertain to histogram filters and kalman filters.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
First, I'd like to know whether the state space was discrete or continuous.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Please check exactly 1 of those 2 boxes over here,

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and I understand these are not entirely non-ambiguous questions,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but in the spirit of the method please check whichever fits best.
