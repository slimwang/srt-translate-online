00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,140
The answer is friends equals friends dot replace. Friend name and a space with

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,350
an empty string. We can look at an example to see how this works. So if this

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:15,960
person is Maria and this person is TJ. If we call Maria dot unfriend TJ, we'll

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,630
come into this method and we'll be doing it for this object. First thing that

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,000
happens is we call friends dot replace friend dot name with a space after it,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,970
and then replace it with an empty string. Friends is initially TJ Jamesha. And

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,210
friend dot name, whoops, that's actually an error, it should be nonfriend dot

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,819
name. Do you think that's a compile time error, or a run time error? I'll just

9
00:00:37,819 --> 00:00:45,890
fix it. So nonfriend, aas TJ dot name is the string with TJ and nothing else.

10
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,796
And then we're adding that together with another space. So we look for the TJ

11
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:57,820
space and friends, and we replace it with an empty string. So this creates a

12
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,946
new string, Jamesha with a space. And now we take that string and we make

13
00:01:03,946 --> 00:01:10,960
friends, which again was Maria is friends. Stop pointing at TJ Jamesha, and

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,335
point at just Jamesha with a space.
