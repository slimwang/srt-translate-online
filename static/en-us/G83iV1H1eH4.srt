>> We know that 5x over 6 is just the same as 5 6ths times x. So to get rid of

2
00:00:05,159 --> 00:00:09,863
this coefficient of 5 6ths, we just need to multiply each side by its

3
00:00:09,863 --> 00:00:15,422
reciprocal, which is 6 5ths. And we end up with x equals 24 over 5. Let's check

4
00:00:15,422 --> 00:00:20,457
our answer just to be sure. We plug 24 over 5 back into the original equation.

5
00:00:20,457 --> 00:00:25,078
We're going to start by just working with the left hand side of the equation and

6
00:00:25,078 --> 00:00:29,381
seeing if what we end up with is equal to the right side. 5 times 24 over 5 is

7
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:33,925
just 24, and we leave the denominator the same, since we didn't do anything to

8
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:38,819
it. 24 over 6 is 4. The left hand side simplifies to 4, which is equal to our

9
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:41,015
right hand side. So we are good.
