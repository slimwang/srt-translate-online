1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,990
What do you think, David?

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,235
This is provable.

3
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:02,830
>> Some said that no,

4
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,870
based on the knowledge that we're
given here about the mug, a pot, and

5
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,590
an object, and
the things that we know from the past,

6
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,400
we can't actually prove
that this object is a mug.

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,710
We can prove that the object is stable,
and

8
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,910
enables drinking based on what we
saw with the proof of the cup.

9
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,250
The object we're dealing with here,

10
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,170
had all the same criteria as our object
in the other example in addition.

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,530
To these thick sides,
and being made of clay.

12
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,690
So because we had everything else,

13
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,570
we were able to easily prove that
it's stable and enables drinking.

14
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,000
But what we can't do is we
can't link protecting its heat

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,620
to limiting heat transfer.

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,500
Nothing in my definition of pot
actually tells me that the fact that it

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,960
limits heat transfer actually
protects against heat.

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,450
So, while for my definition of
pot I can abstract that because

19
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,590
my new object has thick sides and is
made of clay, it limits heat transfer,

20
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,910
I can't make that last connection
to protecting against heat.

21
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,170
>> That is good David.

22
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,180
Now let's make sure that we understand
the processing that David did.

23
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,180
He wanted to show that
the object is a mug.

24
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,820
So he looked at the conditions,
the open conditions of

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,770
proving that the object is a mug,
and there were three of them.

26
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,040
For each of them,
he tried to build a proof.

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,920
He could do so for the first two,
but this was the open one.

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,560
So he came up with the closest example,
that was the pot.

29
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,850
And he did the abstraction here, but
he was unable to link these two,

30
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,690
because there is no knowledge which
links these two at the present time.
