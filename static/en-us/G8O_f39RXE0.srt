1
00:00:00,508 --> 00:00:03,340
Some of the reasons
that it was rejected.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,850
People just didn't buy my vision.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,740
People didn't think that
they can execute on that.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,780
People thought that they saw companies
that wanted to do the same thing.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,250
But they failed.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,210
So they assume that I'm
going to fail as well.

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:24,150
People thought the market is not real or
people thought the market is too

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,760
small or people thought the market is
too big and there's no chance that

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,000
the small fish like me would be
able to take a decent cut of it.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,950
People thought that we don't have
the necessary skills in the team.

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,860
And people thought that we just
don't know what we're doing.

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,830
So we were rejected so many times,
many more times than we were accepted.
