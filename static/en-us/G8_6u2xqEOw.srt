1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,690
Here's one possible solution.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,670
Remember that a bitonic
split pares elements from

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,400
each half of the bitonic sequence.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,400
For each pair it then pulls out
the smaller and the larger.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,500
That is of course the perfect task for
a plus comparator.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,570
So here notice how the plus comparators
pair elements of the input sequence.

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,350
The mins of each pair will
show up on these wires and

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,980
the maxes will show up on these wires.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,050
Let's check the output.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,299
Both halves of the output
are bitonic up to a circular shift.

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,510
Awesome.

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,780
Now I happen to place
the comparators this way.

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,439
But of course, any permutation
of the comparators would work.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,190
So, a valid final bitonic split
circuit would look like this.

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,640
By the way, what's the work and
span of this circuit?

16
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,070
I'll let you ponder that while
I get ready for the next topic.
