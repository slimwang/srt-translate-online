00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,258
If we want 0 to be a root, that means that we want one of our x-intercepts and

2
00:00:05,258 --> 00:00:11,177
also our y-intercept to be point 0,0. Right now, the y-intercept is at negative

3
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:16,847
10, or rather 0, negative 10 so that we want to move that point from being down

4
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:22,044
there to being up here. That means, we need to move the graph up 10 units.
