Here's our answer. Great algebra skills if you found that one out. First we

2
00:00:04,665 --> 00:00:09,990
distribute our negative sign to each term in our numerator. So we'll have plus

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,457
negative two b plus five. Make sure you change that sign there. Next we find the

4
00:00:15,457 --> 00:00:20,852
lowest common denominator, which is b plus two, times b minus two, times b plus

5
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:25,874
five. Next we multiply each fraction by a form of one. This denominator was

6
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:31,314
missing b plus 5, and this denominator was missing b plus 2. Next we multiply

7
00:00:31,314 --> 00:00:37,356
these two numerators together, to get b squared plus 8b plus 15. For the second

8
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:42,368
equivalent fraction, we'll multiply negative 2b plus 5, times b plus 2. This

9
00:00:42,368 --> 00:00:46,904
gives us this trinomial, and finally we add the like terms of each numerator

10
00:00:46,904 --> 00:00:53,719
together. B squared and negative 2b squared equals negative 1b squared. 8b and

11
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,800
positive b equal 9b and 15 and 10 equal 25. So this is our final answer. We also

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,946
know that this is our final answer because we can't factor this enumerator

13
00:01:04,946 --> 00:01:09,574
further. There are no factors of negative 25. That's sum to positive nine. I

14
00:01:09,574 --> 00:01:14,162
hope you've gained a lot of practice with adding and subtracting rational

15
00:01:14,162 --> 00:01:15,113
expressions.
