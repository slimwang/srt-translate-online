1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,644
The factored form for this expression is 2u plus 5 times u plus 1. And the

2
00:00:05,644 --> 00:00:10,338
solutions for u are negative 5 halves and negative 1. Now that's some great

3
00:00:10,338 --> 00:00:15,712
work if you got these two correct. To factor this quadratic, we find factors of

4
00:00:15,712 --> 00:00:21,459
10 that sum to positive 7. Those factors are 2 and 5. So, we rewrite our middle

5
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:26,878
term using these as coefficients. Then, we use factoring by grouping to get 2u

6
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:32,334
plus 5 times u plus 1 equals 0. We set each factor equal to 0 and then we solve

7
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:40,113
for the variable u. u can equal negative 5 halves or u can equal negative 1.
