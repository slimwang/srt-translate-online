00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,676
Here's another error that many people make. Remember what our goal was? Our

2
00:00:04,676 --> 00:00:09,675
goal was that our balance should be bigger than the target. So lots of people,

3
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:13,510
when they write their while loop, they put that goal, which they have firmly in

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,938
their mind, into the header of the loop. But that's not how the while loop

5
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:22,150
works. The while loop says I want to stay in the loop while the condition is

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,997
fulfilled, and that's exactly the opposite of the goal. That's a common

7
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:31,170
confusion. I'll let you fix it in just a minute, but here's how I remember it.

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,860
Look at the board, little girl there. And she's warning, are we there yet? Have

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,395
I reached my goal, namely to be at the destination? And while loops are not

10
00:00:39,395 --> 00:00:42,800
like little girls, they're the exact opposite. They're excited to be going and

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,700
going and going, so you want to formulate your goal while there's still work to

12
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,409
be done, we can do it. You'll get a chance to fix this bug right now.
