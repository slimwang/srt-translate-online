1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,760
You've seen two of these already.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,750
The one with two black corners shutting in,

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,620
turned out to have a very strong match.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,170
And we saw that this area on the wall was essentially featureless.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,910
Similarly, any region that is too bright, or too dark,

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,874
has too little information to be useful.

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,220
Also, regions that only have horizontal edges going through them, like this, or

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,160
this one, are not useful in our stereo set up.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,957
This is because they could result in multiple matches along the epipolar line.

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,440
Okay then, which ones are good?

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,980
Anything with a fairly distinct corner works.

12
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,300
So do regions with distinct vertical boundaries.

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,930
If you consider the epipolar lines going through them, you'll see that

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,440
there's no other region in the image along that line which matches the region.
