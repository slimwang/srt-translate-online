1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,298
This first choice is correct. A function has an inverse if no horizontal line

2
00:00:04,298 --> 00:00:09,188
passes through its graph at more than one point. Now if a function passes this

3
00:00:09,188 --> 00:00:13,218
test, if it meets this criterion, which we call the horizontal line test, then

4
00:00:13,218 --> 00:00:17,062
that means that its reflection in the line y equals x will pass the vertical

5
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:22,732
line test. Which means that, that reflection is a function. If we verify that

6
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:26,701
the reflection of a function in the line y equals x is itself a function, then

7
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:32,359
that means that the original function does in fact, have an inverse.
