Here's our fifth and final problem for exponential equations. We have 16 raised

2
00:00:04,373 --> 00:00:09,879
to the 2x plus 1, equal to 64 raised to the x plus 3. Notice that 2x plus 1 is

3
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:19,120
our entire exponent, and x plus 3 is our entire exponent. What do you think x

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,680
equals in this case?
