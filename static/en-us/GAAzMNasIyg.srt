00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,090
Welcome to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,720
Today were going to this might be the
last one of the lectures on just sort of

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,590
this collection of stuff, that I, maybe
not be thought of core computer vision,

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,200
but just stuff that I thought
you guys should be exposed to

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,440
one way or the other.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,260
Also want to give a shout
out to a Kelsey Hawkins,

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,440
who helped produce some
of the material here.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,030
So that's opposed to all the other
people that I stole things from,

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,450
since Kelsey's actually my student and
put this talk together,

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,990
I thought I would, I would do that.

11
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,589
But today I want to talk to you a little
about, a little bit about depth sensing.

12
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:33,516
I would say that this is tremendously
driven by the fact that there's a lot

13
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:38,140
of work recently in Computer Vision
dealing for robotics.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,602
The re, recovery of depth previously had
been a bi, back in the 60s, 70s, and

15
00:00:43,602 --> 00:00:46,330
80s, had been a big focus
in Computer Vision.

16
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,390
Then things sort of moved away
into more certain motion things,

17
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,291
labeling stuff, processing a video
to extract stuff, and, and

18
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,150
of course processing all
the images on the web.

19
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,320
But in the last decade or so, with the
growth of robotics, there's this goal to

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,489
be able to visually extract information
from the scene for a robot.

21
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,050
And a lot of that
information that's desired

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,880
is about the geometry
of what's out there.

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,920
Where is there stuff,
where is there not stuff?

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,730
What things are on the table?

25
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,430
How would I pick them up off the table?

26
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,790
So that sort of given a resurgence
to the interest in recovering

27
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,040
geometry that's out there.

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,440
And, of course, recovering geometry
is a fundamentally difficult problem

29
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,920
in Computer Vision.

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,740
You know, here is a picture.

31
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,810
You look at this, monocularly, and

32
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,590
you see a surface with
some geometry on there.

33
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,100
There's a certain ambiguity,
perhaps, as to what's in front and

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,220
what's behind, but
there's a question of,

35
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,295
well, how do you get a single image to,
to understand this kind of stuff?

36
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:45,275
You, of course,
have all these problems that intensity,

37
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:48,435
image intensity changes as
a function of the illumination.

38
00:01:48,435 --> 00:01:52,940
But here's an image of same scene
lit from different colored light.

39
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,990
And, of course, it provides
a different image to be processed.

40
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,800
And yet, the geometry is identical.

41
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,810
We've talked about this before,
challenges of scale.

42
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,210
Here's an interesting picture.

43
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,210
When you look at this table,
you see a bunch of, white bowls, cups,

44
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,419
et cetera, whatever.

45
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,290
But if we actually were to sort of
take a look at just in this patch

46
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,400
right there, [LAUGH] clearly
there's not a whole lot of

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,800
interesting variation going on there for
image processing to handle.

48
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,670
And, you know, somehow it basically has
to be able to, to somehow figure out

49
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,740
from the basic extraction of this shape
that there's this cylinder on the table.

50
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,780
And that's generally a hard thing to do.

51
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,010
We also have trouble that,

52
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,040
color is not all that discriminative
sometimes, of what's there.

53
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,480
So there's sort of a,
a similarity between the foreground, and

54
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,742
the background.

55
00:02:36,742 --> 00:02:39,330
What we'd really like is
we'd like some representa,

56
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,510
something that gave us
the shape directly.

57
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,600
And so, that we would see
something that looks like this.

58
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,020
And then it won't surprise you
that this is where we're headed.

59
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,000
So here is a bunch of
objects on a table.

60
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,960
And, you know, it'd be nice if the
system could just know that this was one

61
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,650
surface, and that this was another
surface, and these were the objects.

62
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,380
And, what we're going to do is we're
going to talk about 3D sensing.
