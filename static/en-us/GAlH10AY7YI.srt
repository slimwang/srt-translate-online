1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,723
Another possible way we might deal with that is to use hassattr. This is a test

2
00:00:04,723 --> 00:00:09,374
of whether an object has a particular attribute. Hassattr is a built in operator

3
00:00:09,374 --> 00:00:14,366
and has attribute a value of true of the object has an attribute with the given

4
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:18,911
name. As an example, if fussy is a DiscerningBear instance, if we ask if fussy

5
00:00:18,911 --> 00:00:23,366
has an attribute, knock<u>down</u>tree, we'll get true. But if we ask if it has a

6
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:27,415
climb_tree attribute, we'll get false. That's because it's a grizzly bear, which

7
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:32,094
doesn't have a climb_tree. Using has attribute, we could define bear chase like

8
00:00:32,094 --> 00:00:36,605
this. Almost identical to what we did before with this instance. Except for now,

9
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:40,983
we're using hassattr instead of this instance. And instead of checking if it's a

10
00:00:40,983 --> 00:00:00,000
black bear or a grizzly bear, we're checking whether it has a climb_tree or a

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
knock<u>down</u>tree attribute.
