1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,510
In this lesson we discussed
the interplay between the geometry

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,410
of intersecting flat or
linear objects in space and

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,660
the algebra of solving
systems of linear equations.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,860
We then use the geometric insight
into the algebraic process to develop

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:19,090
an algorithm, the Gaussian elimination
algorithm, for solving systems of

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,690
an arbitrary number of linear equations
in an arbitrary number of variables.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,600
This is a valuable tool, since it lets
us solve a large class of interesting

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,800
problems that come up often
in science and engineering.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,320
In future lessons,

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,660
we will develop vector algebra more
systematically looking at the problem

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,650
of solving systems of equations
in a different light.

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,000
As questions about physical
transformations of space.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,050
We will then use this new insight to
develop more tools for solving problems.
