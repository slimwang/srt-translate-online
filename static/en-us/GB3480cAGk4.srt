00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,602
At the end of this unit, you'll do
a project on unsupervised learning.

2
00:00:03,602 --> 00:00:07,237
We'll give you a data set, but unlike
the data set from the previous project,

3
00:00:07,237 --> 00:00:08,792
this data set has no labels to it.

4
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:12,442
And, we'll ask you to construct
a model just of the data that's there.

5
00:00:12,442 --> 00:00:15,080
Now, the exciting thing about this
is because there are no labels to

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,440
this data, your model may actually
differ from somebody else's model.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,250
You may choose to focus on different
factors or different variables and

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,620
that's not a bad thing.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,840
The quality of your model is determined
by your goals, the predictions you're

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,300
trying to make, or
the questions you're trying to answer.

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,900
So, focus on the kinds of questions
you're trying to answer when

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,300
constructing your model of the data.
