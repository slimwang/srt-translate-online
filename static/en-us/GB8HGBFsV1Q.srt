1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,770
Recall the metrics of
interest in the work span or

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,640
the multi-threaded DAG model.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,630
There's a total number of operations for
work, there's a critical path length, or

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,590
span, there's the ratio of those two,
or the average of available parallelism.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,040
There's execution time
bounded from below and

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,680
above according to Brent's theorem,
and finally there's self speedup.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,830
Self speedup is relative to the same
algorithm run on just one processor

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,685
rather than relative to
the best sequential algorithm.

9
00:00:27,685 --> 00:00:29,615
Lucky you, I have a question for you.

10
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:34,295
Of these five measures,
which one best expresses dynamic power?

11
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:37,325
For the purpose of this exercise,
you can ignore constant power, and

12
00:00:37,325 --> 00:00:40,337
you can assume a constant
energy per operation.

13
00:00:40,337 --> 00:00:43,807
The case of variable energy per
operation is also a lot of fun, but

14
00:00:43,807 --> 00:00:47,277
let's not consider that for the moment.

15
00:00:47,277 --> 00:00:49,780
Dun, dun, dun.
