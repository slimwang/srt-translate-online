00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,763
When you orbit the camera around something, the target's fixed and only the

2
00:00:02,763 --> 00:00:06,160
position changes. When you turn the camera to the left, you're fixed in

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,916
position and the target changes. When you're zooming in you're not doing any

4
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:12,930
kind of change because you're just changing the field of view. When you pan

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,844
you're moving the camera perpendicular to the way it's facing, so both the

6
00:00:15,844 --> 00:00:20,796
target and position change. In fact, controlling where the target location is

7
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:24,920
can be a somewhat frustrating part of using various graphics modelers. If you

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,002
pan and then orbit, you're now orbiting around some different target location,

9
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:32,002
which may not have been what was intended. Note that I didn't ask about the

10
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:36,282
effect of dulling in the target in position. Dolly certainly changes the

11
00:00:36,282 --> 00:00:39,920
position, but it's up to the program whether to change the target in this case.

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,544
If the control also moves the target, it's likely you're walking forward and

13
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:46,052
don't particularly care where the target is located. If the target doesn't

14
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:48,868
change, it's like you're walking towards and object and perhaps slow down as

15
00:00:48,868 --> 00:00:50,430
you approach it.
