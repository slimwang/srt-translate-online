1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Just to recap, trademark protects branding and marks. It gives you the right to prevent

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
others from using confusingly similar marks and logos. It lasts as long as you

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
use the mark. The more you use it, the stronger your protection.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And there are country-by-country laws that define trademark, and it's optional

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
to register it, but it has significant advantages if it's approved.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Copyright just gives you the right to prevent others from copying or distributing

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
or making derivatives of your work. And you could copyright more than just technology.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's what we do for songs, books, movies, etc. It lasts practically forever but doesn't

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
prevent independent development. Someone else could do something

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
independently and come up with something quite similar. You could register it.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's optional but is required to sue for infringement, and sometimes you see copyright

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
labeled on the bottom of something with a little c with a circle. That means somebody

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
is claiming that this is their original work and suggesting that you need their license

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
or permission to make a copy. Trade secrets as we talked about, you want to keep that

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
a secret, and it has economic value. No registration is required. It's basically

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
how safe do you think your idea is going to be inside your company protected with

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
armed guards and a vault. It can last for as long as you take reasonable steps.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Contracts--again, it's everything that's in the contract, no registration process.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You have whatever protection is defined in the contract.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Now patents are interesting. A patent is a government is giving you a monopoly

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
by preventing others from making, using, or selling your invention, even if the other's

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
infringement was innocent or accidental. And this has to be a non-obvious invention.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It has to last--the protection lasts for about 15 to 20 years. And there's a whole

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
application and examination process, and it's worth you getting up to date and

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
understanding about patents early on. A very rough rule of thumb is if you're in

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
web 2.0, you probably shouldn't be spending a lot of time on patents,

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
though there are exceptions. If you're in life sciences, in the other extreme, you shouldn't

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
leave your bedroom without a patent counsel walking you out. There are some

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
rules of thumb for each industry and each market, and you really need to spend

30
00:02:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
at least an hour before you start your company understanding what rules apply.
