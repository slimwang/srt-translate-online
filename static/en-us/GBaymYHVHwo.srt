1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,719
So what happens if there
are repeated states?

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:09,660
So if there were repeated states then,
oh I see.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,530
So let's imagine that we did
outcome based updates sort of then

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,620
we saw repeated states.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,960
And all you're really doing is ignoring
anything, oh I see, okay, okay.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,890
How about this, Michael?

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,617
Tell me if what I'm saying makes sense.

8
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:22,383
>> Sure.

9
00:00:22,383 --> 00:00:27,101
>> So if we were doing outcome-based
updates, then basically, you're just

10
00:00:27,101 --> 00:00:31,818
looking at all the rewards that you see,
the values that you kind of expected

11
00:00:31,818 --> 00:00:36,120
along the way, and it's exactly
what you have written down before.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,360
But if we had a repeated state,
then you're basically ignoring

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,332
anything you learned along the way.

14
00:00:44,332 --> 00:00:46,197
So [CROSSTALK]
>> During the episode, right.

15
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:47,860
>> During the episode.

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,840
So outcome-based updates learn
nothing during the episode.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,935
So if your sequence up there, instead
of being S1, S2, S3, SF, had been S1,

18
00:00:57,935 --> 00:01:02,127
S2, S3, S1, SF,

19
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:06,800
then what would have happened
is I would have seen

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,620
the rewards that I saw, r1, r2, r3, and
then some other reward that I would see.

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,044
Let's call it r1 prime or
something, I don't know.

22
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,390
I would be pretending as if I didn't
already know something about state one,

23
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,670
because I also saw it go from
state one to state two, and

24
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,630
saw a particular reward r1.

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,840
>> Yes.

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,040
>> I'd be ignoring that.

27
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,420
So what this TD(1) update lets you
do is, when you see s one again,

28
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,620
and sort of back up its value.

29
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,551
You've actually captured the fact
that last time you were in s1,

30
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:43,630
you actually went to s2 and
saw reward r1.

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,990
>> Right, exactly, so
it's like the outcome-based on updates

32
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,670
now with extra learning or
inside the episode learning.

33
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,320
>> I like it, beautiful.

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,034
So is that better?

35
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:55,973
>> Let's say yes.

36
00:01:55,973 --> 00:01:57,400
>> Excellent.

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,900
That makes me feel good about myself.
