1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:05,840
You can use Analytics to get other
kinds of data, not just screen views.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,770
I'll quickly show you
the kinds of data you can get,

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,990
and then you'll try it out for yourself.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,000
You can add code to your app to
find out what your users are doing

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,340
by sending data to Analytics to track
events, like when a button is clicked.

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,910
Or if you're building a game,

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:27,100
say, you could send an event
when a user unlocks a new level.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,333
Here's an example of the event
screen in the Analytics dashboard.

9
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:34,420
So you see the category of the event,
and you see the actions.

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,520
You can find out if your users
are doing what you hoped they'll do

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,810
by setting goals.

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,750
For example, you might set a goal for
the users to click the Buy Now button,

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,020
or click on an ad, or
reach a certain page.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,810
So here you see that one of the goals
is for the users to rate the app.

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,180
So you can track how users browse and
buy.

16
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,762
If your app lets users view products and
buy them,

17
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:04,272
you can track how the customers
progress through the shopping flow.

18
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,960
You can see which products get purchased
in the product performance page.

19
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,390
And you can track the steps throughout
the purchase and checkout process.

20
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,550
To track the way users view and

21
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,490
buy things, your app needs to have
the structure and code in place.

22
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,280
For users to browse products,
add them to the cart, checkout.

23
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,160
And then to get the Analytics data,

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,170
you need to add code to send a hit to
Analytics at each stage of the process.

25
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,740
You can also track how long it takes for
things to happen in your app.

26
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,890
You need to write the code to time
the task that needs to be timed.

27
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,854
And then you add the code to send the
hit to Analytics to report the timing

28
00:02:05,854 --> 00:02:06,361
data.

29
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:10,770
And you see the timing info in the App
Speed page in the Behavior section

30
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,980
in the dashboard.

31
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,460
And you can track when things go wrong.

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,370
You can send data to Analytics when
your app throws an exception or,

33
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,160
in the hopefully unlikely event,
has a crash.

34
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,520
So here are examples of
a couple different exceptions.

35
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,060
You can also track how
users download your app.

36
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,500
In this course we're not going to
put our app on the Play Store, so

37
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,380
I'll leave you to explore how to track
down those sources in your own time

38
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,250
with an app that you've
published to the Play Store.

39
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,960
So that was a roundup of the kinds of
things you can track with Analytics.

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,030
Now, let's go do some tracking.
