1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,250
Every time an app starts up, it creates
a singleton application object,

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,060
even before it creates
the main activity.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,940
Activities can get hold of
the application object,

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,215
by calling the method getApplication.

5
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:16,975
We're going to save our tracker
in the application object.

6
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:21,235
If you want to add things
to the application object,

7
00:00:21,235 --> 00:00:25,515
you need to create a subclass of
application, but it's pretty simple.

8
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:26,580
I'll show you how.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,020
If you already know how to do it,
bear with me.

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,720
It really won't take long.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,520
You need to extend the application and
save it.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,970
And for now,
that's really all you need to do.

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,130
Next, you need to make sure that
when the application starts,

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,010
it creates an instance
of your new subclass,

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,550
instead of the default
application class.

16
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,290
To do that,
go to Androidmanifest.xml and

17
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:54,690
add a name attribute and
specify the name of your new subclass.

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,160
You'll need to enclose it in strings and
put a dot in front of the name.

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,790
That's all there is to it.

20
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,720
Now when your application starts,

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,180
it creates an instance of
your new application class.

22
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,620
Go ahead and
define the new application subclass now.

23
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,130
You're going to need to create a Java
class that extends Application, then

24
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,900
specify your new class as the name of
the application in AndroidManifest.xml.

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,690
All you need is the name, but
remember to put a dot in front of it.

26
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,580
And when you're done, enter the name
of your application subclass here.
