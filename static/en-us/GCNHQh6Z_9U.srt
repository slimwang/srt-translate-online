1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,245
So we want a new, what we're looking for,
to equal the total amount of money that

2
00:00:04,257 --> 00:00:08,299
Grant can count on getting from his
friends after the second day of sales, so

3
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:12,610
that needs to account for the money from
the people who bought on the first day and

4
00:00:12,622 --> 00:00:16,863
the money from the people who bought on
the second day. We already know from this

5
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:21,003
equation that we came up with earlier that
he'll make 36w+22n Dollars from the

6
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:25,247
initial batch of buyers. So, that means
the equation that we have down here still

7
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:29,427
needs to have these terms in it. A couple
of the equations don't, so I'm going to

8
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,817
cross them off our list. Neither of these
answers includes the money from the people

9
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:38,204
bought from Grant on the first day. The
other four answers that are left over All

10
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:43,326
have 36W and 22N as terms. So that's
great. However this first one only has 36W

11
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:48,788
plus 22N. It doesn't have any information
having to do with people who bought on the

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,056
second day. So that can't be right, since
we know that Grant will make some money

13
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:58,260
off of that second round of buyers. To
pick between these three remaining

14
00:00:58,272 --> 00:01:02,715
equations we need to go through similar
steps for people who buy wipers and people

15
00:01:02,727 --> 00:01:07,125
who buy nozzles as we did in some of the
earlier quizzes to figure out the terms in

16
00:01:07,137 --> 00:01:11,525
this equation for a old. We know that the
price per wiper is still w. And since 51

17
00:01:11,537 --> 00:01:15,970
more people are going to buy wipers we're
going to need to add 51w in. In our

18
00:01:15,982 --> 00:01:21,743
equation. This choice doesn't have 51 w.
It has 50 w. So it can't be right. Then

19
00:01:21,755 --> 00:01:27,366
for the money he'll earn from these 25
extra people buying two nozzles each is

20
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:32,943
going to be = 25 * 2 n. Since n is the
price per nozzle and they each buy two. If

21
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:38,091
we simplify 25 * 2 n we actually get 50n.
So we also need to have 50n, in our

22
00:01:38,103 --> 00:01:43,277
answer. Both of these last 2 choices have
36w, and 22n in them, and they also have

23
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:48,530
51w and 50n, so that means they are both
correct. The only difference between them,

24
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:53,549
is the order that the terms are arranged
in. This is just another case, of the

25
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:58,167
communative property of addition. Awesome
job! I know this was a really tough quiz

26
00:01:58,179 --> 00:01:59,734
so great job for getting through it.
