00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,450
This is True.

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,440
Always be sure to update
a recommendation using the same ID

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,790
as the previous one.

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,670
If instead you create
a new recommendation,

5
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,220
this could cause the order of your
cards on the recommendations row

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,040
to shift around and might annoy users.
