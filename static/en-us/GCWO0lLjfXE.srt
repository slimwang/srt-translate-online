00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,662
Right off the bat we know we have to deal with the distance between x and 4, so

2
00:00:04,662 --> 00:00:09,258
I can write the absolute value of x minus 4. And if this is at least 5, then I

3
00:00:09,258 --> 00:00:13,965
can translate that as, that this is greater than or equal to 5. So that's our

4
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:14,488
answer.
