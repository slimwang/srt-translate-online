1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,790
What we're going to do is,

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,950
now we're going to look at some properties of the Harris detector.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,290
And actually of, of one or two other ways of detecting some interest points.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,180
Remember, the reason we're doing this is to find points that

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,890
are going to be our feature points.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,620
So, let's start with rotation, okay?

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,010
If I've got an image.

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,720
So we have here a little.

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,800
Notional corner.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,570
And I would rotate it, how would the Harris operator change?

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,470
Well, remember that whole thing about the ellipse rotating?

12
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,040
Well the ellipse would rotate, right?

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,090
But it would be the same ellipse, right?

14
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,760
Because the variations in the gradients would be the same over the window.

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,700
They just, the whole thing would have rotated.

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,560
So basically, the Harris corner detector is invariant to rotation.

17
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,010
That's cool. You don't have to take my word for it, you can take somebody elses

18
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,720
word for it, no, you can actually study these things empirically, alright.

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,530
So the idea is you take some picture, you find some corners, and

20
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,050
then you change the picture somehow, right.

21
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,170
So, maybe you rotate it a little bit, and then you find some corners again, and

22
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,550
you measure sort of this repeatability.

23
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,920
Right? So the number of correspondences that were found versus

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,570
the possible ones that you should have found.

25
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,340
That is, how repeatable was the ability to find the same corners?

26
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,360
And as you can see here, as they varied the rotation of the picture all the way

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,780
up to 180 degrees, you've got pretty good reviews.

28
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,460
By the way, ImpHarrises improved Harris.

29
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,420
But you can see that both Harris and the improved Harris are.

30
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,080
Pretty invariant with respect to rotation.

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,110
By the way, these plots come from this very nice paper from Cordelia Schmid and,

32
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:38,970
and folks there.

33
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,270
And in fact, here it is, showing you,

34
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,110
it's from the International Journal of Computer Vision.

35
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,260
I put this, these sort of basic res, sources in here just so

36
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,960
you can see where some of this stuff comes from.

37
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,910
And if you're interested in computer vision,

38
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,060
I encourage you to take a look at what these.

39
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,090
Papers actually do, to get a sense of how this stuff got derived.
