00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In this problem, we want to modify add<u>to</u>index

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
such that a particular URL appears only once for a given keyword.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
As the code stands here, if a keyword appears twice in a URL,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the URL will be in the index twice for that keyword,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
if you could follow along.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The solution to this is actually really simple and only a single line of code.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
First let's go over add<u>to</u>index really briefly.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If we want to add this URL to this keyword in the index,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
we're going to go through everything in the index,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and when we hit the right entry for that keyword,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
as it stands now, we simply append the URL to the URL list.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But we're going to add 1 line of code that says only append to the URL list

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
if the URL doesn't already appear in that list.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We also need to fix our tabbing--very important--and that's it.
