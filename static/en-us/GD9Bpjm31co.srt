00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,640
Suppose you want to classify which person wrote an email.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,270
On the other side are now 100 people in your organization.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,250
And they even have a,

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,940
I don't know, an id equals 1 to 100 depending on when they're drawn.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,630
So the first person has number 1.

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,059
And the last person is number 100.

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,600
Is this is continuous, or discrete?
