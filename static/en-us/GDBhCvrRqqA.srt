Welcome to the Core Sandbox a place
where you'll be testing out Swift code.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,400
Here you'll mainly be doing two things,
running example code

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,310
to see its output and writing your own
code to complete programming challenges.

4
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:17,800
Let's say I wanted to know what
a particular line of code does,

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,539
what about the print function?

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:23,048
Here I'll try out some math, I'll put
some math here in between parenthesis.

7
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:30,270
And then I come down here and press
test run and it prints out the results.

8
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,649
Let's try out a string.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,460
Again, I press test run and
here I can see my string is printed out.

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,880
Hello from the iOS team!

11
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,159
And I can see that this function prints
out whatever I put between parentheses.

12
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,158
So if you want to know what a line
of code does, you can always return

13
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:54,618
to this page, type in some code,
print the output, and press Test Run.

14
00:00:54,618 --> 00:00:56,338
