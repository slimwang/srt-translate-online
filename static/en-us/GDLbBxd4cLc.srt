1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,342
So, we started out lesson one using a

2
00:00:02,342 --> 00:00:04,910
lot of different functions, and we built two main

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,590
projects. In the first one, we helped our

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,260
friends take a break and in the second one

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,140
we sent a secret message to our loved

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,640
ones. Then we came across a scenario, while building

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,470
a movie website, where using functions didn't quite present

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,210
a very elegant solution. That solution requires something new.

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,720
And that new idea, in programming, is called classes,

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,920
and here in lesson two, we will spend a

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,780
lot of time, and build a lot of different

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,300
examples, showcasing the power of using classes. Now, we will

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,310
return to our movie database example in lesson three.

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,600
But here, in lesson two, we will start out with

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,570
ideas and examples that are the easiest for me

16
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,800
to explain the power of classes to you. Let's begin.
