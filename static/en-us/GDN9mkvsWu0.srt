1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,572
Now let's take a look at the S-Boxes.

2
00:00:02,572 --> 00:00:07,670
A S-Box substitutes a six bit
value with a four bit value,

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,540
using a predefined table.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,760
Therefore, we have
eight S-Boxes in this.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,960
That is we have eight predefined tables.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,920
Given a six bit value,

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,210
the outer two bits are used to
index into the rows of the table.

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,210
And the middle four bits index
into the columns of the table, and

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,680
the value in a table entry is
the output of the four bit value.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,700
Again, these tables are pre-defined, and
there are eight such tables in this.
