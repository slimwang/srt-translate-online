1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,530
To make things concrete, let's
consider two multi threaded processes

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,250
in which the threads need to
communicate via shared memory.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,390
First consider how many segments will
your processes need to communicate.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,780
Will they use one large segment?

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,110
In that case you will have to
implement some type of management of

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,160
this shared memory.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,550
You'll have to have some memory
manager that will allocate and

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,560
free this memory for the threads
from the different processes.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,740
Or you can use multiple segments,

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,240
smaller ones, one for
each pair-wise communication.

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,040
If you choose to do this, it's
probably a good idea to prealloacate,

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,170
ahead of time, a pool of segments.

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,590
So you don't have to slow down,

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,790
that way, every individual communication
with the segment creation overhead.

15
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,040
So, in that case, you will have to
create how will threads pick up

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,340
which of the available segments
they will end up using for

17
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,690
their inter process communication?

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,490
So, using some type of queue of
segment identifiers will be, probably,

19
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,190
a good idea for that.

20
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:08,160
The tricky part here, if you are using
a queue of segment identifiers,

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,580
that means that a thread doesn't know
up front which particular segment

22
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,140
it's going to use for a communication
with a peer thread in the other process.

23
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,060
If that's important for the type of
application that you're developing, you

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,240
can consider communicating the segment
identifier from one process to another

25
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,740
via some other type of communication
mechanism, like via message queue.
