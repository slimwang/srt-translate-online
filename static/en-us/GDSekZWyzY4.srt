1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,100
So what now?

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,130
Well, if you're
an IOS Developer Nanodegree student,

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,939
hopefully you've submitted your app for
grading.

4
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:10,800
And maybe you got feedback, or
maybe you're still waiting.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,675
Either way, you've almost graduated and
that's really exciting so

6
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:15,835
congratulations.

7
00:00:15,835 --> 00:00:19,045
There's just a couple more things
that you need to do before doing so.

8
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:22,145
If you've developed an app that
you'd like to make a business out of

9
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:23,705
I will bring your attention again to

10
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:26,622
the Udacity Entrepreneurship
Management Nanodegree.

11
00:00:26,622 --> 00:00:31,082
Which will take you through the process
of making your app profitable.

12
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:32,772
There's a link to it in
the instructor notes below.

13
00:00:33,842 --> 00:00:35,952
If you've posted your
app to the app store and

14
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:39,062
you're just interested in monitoring
feedback and making it better

15
00:00:39,062 --> 00:00:42,152
there's some instructions for doing so
in the reading notes that follow.

16
00:00:42,152 --> 00:00:45,300
Whatever your path,
this is where I leave you.

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,610
And I hope that you have had as much fun
taking this class as I had making it.

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,600
And I seriously cannot wait
to see what you guys build.

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,170
So, until next time.
