1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,700
All right.
Here's how we're going to define

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,540
our modification of the reward function.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,140
In this case of what we're going
to call potential base shaping.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,890
The potential is going to be
defined by this function, Si is it?

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:12,560
>> Let's go with Si.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,260
>> All right.

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,090
Here's the idea.

8
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,750
Once again, here's our Q function
defined in terms of a reward function.

9
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,600
And I did mess with this a little bit
because I now made rewards dependent on

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,860
the state that we end up in as well.

11
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,480
because that's going to be helpful for

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,300
keeping track of how
rewards are changing.

13
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,300
>> Wait, does that change anything?

14
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,510
That doesn't change anything, right?

15
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,440
Does it?

16
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,120
>> It doesn't change anything
in this Q function, no.

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,410
So it's the reward plus the discounted
value of the next state.

18
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,460
And we average that over
all possible next states

19
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,600
weighted by the transition probability
of ending up in that next state.

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,560
So that's all the same.

21
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,070
If we actually have a reward function
that's not defined in terms of S prime,

22
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:48,740
that's fine.

23
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,550
This is just helpful for the notation.

24
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,960
It doesn't actually change
anything if we ignore S prime,

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,181
the definition of R(s,a)
>> Oh, and in fact, if R(s,a) Ddoesn't

26
00:00:57,181 --> 00:01:00,630
depend of S' then you're just
doing a convex sum over R(s,a) so

27
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,950
you want to put the R(s,a) so you'll
get back to where you were before.

28
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:03,800
>> Exactly right.

29
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,040
So that's right the reward
function pops back out which is

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,830
sort of the opposite of what we
just did we shoved it in there.

31
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,130
>> Okay.
>> Good all right and so now.

32
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,740
Our new reward function, R prime,

33
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,950
that we're going to use is going
to be the old reward function,

34
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,500
first state-action pair, minus
the potential of the state that we're

35
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,080
leaving, plus the discounted potential
of the state that we're entering.

36
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,890
So this difference here between the
potential of the state that we end up in

37
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:36,040
and the potential of the state that
we left is the bonus that we get,

38
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,590
the amount that we're getting warmer,
we're getting closer to good.

39
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,290
>> Okay, so looking at it.

40
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,800
I see, I see, let me make sure
I have the intuition here.

41
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,510
Let's ignore the minus side of S and

42
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,850
just think about the plus
gamma syathus prime.

43
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,180
You're saying that every time we enter
into some state, s prime, we're going to

44
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,830
get that little bonus, which is what
we've been talking about before.

45
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,680
But, now I gotta account for
the minus side of this.

46
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,760
Well, the minus side of this is
just a way of saying yeah, but

47
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,910
whenever I leave a state I
have to lose that bonus, and

48
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,350
that's your way of avoiding those
kind of sub-optimal positive loops.

49
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,310
>> Yeah, exactly right.

50
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,280
It's sort of like, I don't know,
good bookkeeping or accounting.

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,130
We have to make sure that, sure we made
a transition from state s to s prime.

52
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,250
We get this advantage of being in
s prime but we have to have lost

53
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,980
the advantage of having been in
s cause we're not there anymore.

54
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,120
>> Okay, so this makes sense.

55
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,960
>> Great, okay.
So what we need to do now is figure out

56
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,290
what does the new Q function
look like when we've made

57
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,710
these revisions to the rewards as
a function of the old Q function?

58
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,610
>> Okay.
Oh, I think I know the answer.

59
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,590
>> All right, so
do you think you're ready for a quiz or

60
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,870
do you need any additional
explanation of what I'm asking?

61
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,390
>> No, I think I know.

62
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,250
We know either Q of SA is we're going
to change the way the reward function

63
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,610
works to have these potentials, and so
that's going to change what Q of SA is.

64
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,490
It's going to be now called Q prime of
SA, and you want to know if there's some

65
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:14,970
nice way to describe Q prime of SA I
guess in terms of the old q of s of a.

66
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,450
>> That's right, that's right and

67
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,010
in fact there is a nice
way of explaining it.

68
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,970
Or it's not of explaining it but
of defining Q prime in terms of Q.

69
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,030
>> Okay I think I know the answer,
we'll see.
