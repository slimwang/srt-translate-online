Hi, I'm Kathleen. I'm going to be the instructor in this course, this summer.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,552
I'm really enthusiastic about this udacity class. I've been teaching for about

3
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:13,322
fifteen years, and most of that time I've been teaching online and I think it's

4
00:00:13,322 --> 00:00:18,607
really an outstanding way to learn things. In a few moments, you'll meet Kai

5
00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:22,100
and Sarah. They developed this course, and you'll being seeing more of them

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,492
throughout the semester. First, let's look at some of the things you need to

7
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:30,466
know in order to be successful. We've worked hard to give you lots of practice,

8
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:34,800
so you can learn to program. There are lots of in-lesson exercises. See these

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,802
blue and gray rectangles? The circles indicate practice questions. They will

10
00:00:38,802 --> 00:00:42,642
turn blue as you progress through the content. Completing these exercises will

11
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:46,670
prepare you for the problem set. And you need to complete 80% to pass the

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,394
class. These exercises take the place of labs that are required in on-campus

13
00:00:51,394 --> 00:00:56,238
classes. You can try exercises as many times as you want. All that matters is

14
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,119
that you learn to do them. No one counts the number of attempts.
