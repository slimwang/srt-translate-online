00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
There are lots and lots of other interesting applications of asymmetric cryptography.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We'll see some of those later in unit 5,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but for now I want to focus on how to actually build an asymmetric cryptosystem.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What we want to build is what's known as a "trap door" one-way function.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
A one-way function would be a function that is easy to compute in one direction

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and hard to compute in another direction.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
With asymmetric crypto we need to reveal this function.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We want the reverse to still be hard, but we want some way to be able to do the reverse easily

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
if we know some secret. That's our trap door.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We want to be able to--if you have some secret key, you can do the inverse.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If you don't, you can't. That's what makes an asymmetric cryptosystem.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's hard to do in the reverse direction unless you have this extra key.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But revealing the easy way to do the forward direction

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
does not reveal the easy way to do the reverse direction.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Diffe and Hellman envisioned such a cryptosystem

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
in the 1976 paper that we talked about last unit,

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
but they didn't devise a function that had this property.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The first cryptosystem to successfully have this property, is the RSA cryptosystem.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That'll be the focus for the rest of this unit.
