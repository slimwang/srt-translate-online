00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here I've written two partial HTML utterances,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
but I've left some blanks.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This makes it entirely reasonable for you to come in and put things right

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
by adding a small number of characters--the smallest you can--

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
to fill in each blank and make it valid HTML according to previous grammar.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Remember that mostly means the tags have to match up correctly.
