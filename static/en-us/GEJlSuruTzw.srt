00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,680
Now let's look at a couple of other important things about light itself.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,470
One thing about light is it diffracts.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:13,310
Basically because it's the, you know, it's light is best represented as

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,460
waveforms, and the wave nature of light basically suggests that when it hits,

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,710
and it's coming up this way, and it hits.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,540
Hits a surface like this, and if there's a point, once it

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,410
hits this point it basically is going to start creating diffraction patterns.

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,180
So smaller the aperture,

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,320
would actually result in more diffraction from this point on.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,500
So in essence what this shows is that once the light hits this point it actually

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,320
starts creating these diffraction patterns rather than going through straight.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,500
If this was no surface here, it would of course continue going straight.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,250
But once you put an obstruction and a small hole, depending on the size of hole,

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,170
you'd actually get diffraction patterns.

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,830
This is best also shown here,

16
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:58,110
through the light frames of This is also best shown here.

17
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,890
Light is coming in, once it hits this.

18
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:06,000
Because of the opening, a diffraction pattern is created and

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,340
you can see these diffraction patterns as rotations.

20
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,610
And, again, there's a little bit more intensity here that dissipates

21
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,130
as you go there.
