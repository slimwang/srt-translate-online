00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,220
Now that we have to find P,

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:05,560
I want to illustrate how easy it can
be to recognize that a problem is in P.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,550
Recognizing that a problem is
not in P is a little harder.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,130
So for this exercise, assume that if the
group force algorithm is exponential, so

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:15,990
is the best algorithm.

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,310
Consider a finite set of
integers written in binary.

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,400
And I want you to check the problems
here that you would think are in P.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,090
Again, if there isn't an obvious
polynomial-time algorithm,

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:28,770
assume there isn't one.
