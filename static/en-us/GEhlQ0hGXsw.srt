1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,040
Okay, we exit the loop and, well, I'll take into account, I guess,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,420
if there is a point or if there's not a period at the end we

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,050
might have an exception, we'll take that into account.

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,890
Then the, the code brings a new line, and then-

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,410
>> But for, for, for the 31, 31, the commenter,

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,546
are we assuming that we were going to search something here with the,

7
00:00:21,546 --> 00:00:24,137
the use of the word assert or is that just, is that a,-

8
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:28,409
Well I know it was more like a note for myself that the count is

9
00:00:28,409 --> 00:00:33,537
a a blanks because that is the conditions that should be verified here,

10
00:00:33,537 --> 00:00:37,400
I mean I might, may make that into an assert later on.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,780
>> Weren't you for my own edification an amazing, these one,

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,740
two, three, four, Four print lines in a row,

13
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,100
tell me what you're expecting to see coming out of each of those.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,000
>> I'm just expecting to see well, some white space.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,840
>> That's about it.

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,940
So the first one will be a blank plane.

17
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,900
>> Yeah. Just, you know, to kind of put some distance between the list of.

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,349
>> Okay, then the second one will.

19
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:02,392
>> Let's just say the number of blank.

20
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:03,222
>> Is.

21
00:01:03,222 --> 00:01:08,839
>> Is, blanks is and then print the number of blanks.

22
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:09,781
>> Should be printing to a count.

23
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:11,747
>> Yeah, no, you're right, it should.

24
00:01:11,747 --> 00:01:13,128
As I said, I mean, I was kind of kind of writing this in a hurry, and

25
00:01:13,128 --> 00:01:14,040
yeah, this should be, this should be count.

26
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,661
>> And, it would be on the next line.

27
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,079
>> Mm-hm. >> And, it would be on the next-

28
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,968
>> It won't be width contiguous with the text.

29
00:01:20,968 --> 00:01:21,473
>> Yeah.

30
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:23,040
>> Well hold up that, that's [CROSSTALK].

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,476
>> No, actually no.

32
00:01:24,476 --> 00:01:25,855
[INAUDIBLE] >> Oh, I'm sorry, print.

33
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:27,510
>> [CROSSTALK] Couldn't we just combine all these into one.

34
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,605
[CROSSTALK].

35
00:01:29,605 --> 00:01:30,704
>> Yeah, I should probably, yeah.

36
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:32,113
[CROSSTALK].

37
00:01:32,113 --> 00:01:33,910
>> Couldn't we just combine all four of these into one?

38
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,247
[INAUDIBLE].

39
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:41,425
>> Sure, we could use, you know, slash n and then, is slash n is >> Slash n.

40
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:42,085
>> [CROSSTALK].

41
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:44,460
>> Sure, yeah, we could use slash n.

42
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,090
Is that allowed in the kind of code standard that we use?

43
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,390
>> You just told me there weren't any standards and so, yeah.

44
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,898
>> This is just a little amusing.

45
00:01:51,898 --> 00:01:53,167
>> [CROSSTALK] much of, yeah.

46
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:53,990
Mm-hm.

47
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,825
>> Okay, so this can be connected, concatenated in one line,

48
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:00,051
maybe, I thought that this was going to improve readability, but

49
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:01,400
that's >> We don't have to use that.

50
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,082
>> Maybe that's not, that's not the case.

51
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:03,836
>> The other side of this, this paper.

52
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:04,891
>> We have an extra log sheet.

53
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:05,733
>> You going to run out of room?

54
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:07,119
>> I got it. >> Okay, because,-

55
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,193
>> I anticipated ahead that we would have many defects.

56
00:02:09,193 --> 00:02:11,209
>> Well, obviously, that's been the case.

57
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:13,206
>> Maybe you're being too picky, but fine.

58
00:02:13,206 --> 00:02:17,120
>> It looks like dogs barks, repetition precedes it.

59
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,190
[LAUGH]. >> Well let's continue for now.
