1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,740
In this lesson you got some hands-on
experience working with real APIs.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,640
I encourage you to keep
exploring other APIs, and

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,500
get used to going through documentation
so you can use them for future projects.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,870
I listed some of my favorite
APIs in the instructor notes.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,070
In this next lesson, you're going
to learn to create your own APIs,

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,680
that you and
other developers can implement.
