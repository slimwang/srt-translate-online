1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,450
So far the message already says
"Total: and the price, and

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,710
we just need to update it so
it also says thank you.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,080
I'm going to update the string variable
because I want to practice that.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,010
So I'm going to create a new line of
code that updates the price message.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,530
And I'm going to just add on to
whatever's in the price message string.

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,660
And I'm going to add Thank you!

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,120
Let's run this on the device.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,959
Okay, if I change the quantity and I hit
order, then it says, Total $15Thank you!

9
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:35,460
And it all runs together
without any spaces.

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,190
But the thing is,
I don't really just want a single space.

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,700
I really need it to go on the next line.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,584
If you remember earlier in the lesson,
I mentioned escape characters in Java.

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,187
Escape sequences are a character
preceded by a backslash, and

14
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:55,110
they mean something special
to the Java compiler.

15
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,340
Before we used it to insert
a double quote in a string.

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,450
Now we can use it to insert
a new line in a text.

17
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,170
In the code, I'm going to add \n so

18
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,170
that it creates a new line
right before it says Thank you!

19
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,480
When I run the app and
change the quality and I hit Order,

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,580
then it says Total $15, and then it adds
a new line and then it says Thank you!

21
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,940
Yay!

22
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,000
And thank you for doing all
the coding tasks in lesson two.
