00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,593
You may have figured out we first need to convert 240 to the z score. In other

2
00:00:05,593 --> 00:00:11,313
words we want to find out how many standard deviations away from the mean, 190,

3
00:00:11,313 --> 00:00:16,778
240 is. So it's going to be one point something. So first we take the distance

4
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:22,410
between 190 and 240, and then we divide by the standard deviation, to find out

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,254
how many standard deviations fit into that distance. So we get about 1.39. We

6
00:00:28,254 --> 00:00:34,398
have to round to the hundredths place, because the z table we have doesn't get

7
00:00:34,398 --> 00:00:40,523
more precise than that. So our z score is 1.39, so let's bring up the table.

8
00:00:40,523 --> 00:00:46,919
First, we find 1.3. And we find 0.09, which is the last column. And we find that

9
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:53,718
the area, less than a standard deviation of 1.39 is 0.9177. So this means that

10
00:00:53,718 --> 00:01:00,668
approximately 91.77% of people will have less than 240 Facebook friends. And

11
00:01:00,668 --> 00:01:07,730
remember, this is all assuming that this is a normal distribution with mean 190

12
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,192
and standard deviation 36.
