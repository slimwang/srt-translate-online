1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,100
My next question was, well, okay, so people aren't

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,180
very good at guessing their audience sizes. But maybe,

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,220
maybe people who are older, maybe they have a

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,670
better sense, than teenagers, for example. So the next

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,390
plot that we did was another scatter plot, but

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,380
this time we added a third level, where we

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,910
added color to represent the age of the survey

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,380
respondent. And you can see again we have this horizontal

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,090
stripes for people who are guessing that there are 50

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,720
or 100 people in their audience. But I don't see

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,720
any pattern in the color. I think this is actually

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,660
kind of a dead end. This is one example of

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,480
kind of a failure. I can tell if younger people

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,750
were more accurate then older people, there is too much

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,160
over plotting. In this plot there are too many dots

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,490
on top of each other and color really doesn't add much.
