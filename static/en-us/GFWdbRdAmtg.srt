1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,780
So far we have been talking
about technical controls,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,584
whether it has to do
with authentication.

3
00:00:06,584 --> 00:00:10,389
Or in the context of network security,
we talked about firewalls and

4
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:12,168
[INAUDIBLE] detection and so on.

5
00:00:12,168 --> 00:00:18,451
And these are used to secure systems
that we have in an organization.

6
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:22,690
What are the assets that
need to be secured?

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,300
Who do they need to be secured from?

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,410
So let's talk a little bit more
about this organizational context.

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,420
We said, there's something of
value that is under threat, so

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,450
we need to worry about securing it.

11
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,501
But what other reasons may be there for
us to worry about this problem?

12
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:44,235
While there may be legal and compliance
reasons, financial data and health data,

13
00:00:44,235 --> 00:00:48,090
for example, HIPAA mandates how you
can share online health data or

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,130
distill health data and
things like that.

15
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,740
One solution that we've been talking
about is that of course there

16
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,000
are various kind of technical controls.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,686
For me to use these technical controls,

18
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:03,560
I have to understand what
kind of risk that I'm facing.

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,550
What is the threat source?

20
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,770
What is that threat landscape for me?

21
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,980
Of course the technical solution or

22
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,580
control that I have is going to
have an associated cost.

23
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,370
I have to worry about what that cost is,
and, what is the benefit of actually

24
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,080
deploying this particular solution
that we're talking about?
