Before we get back to Marla,

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,770
there's one thing you should
know about chronic disease.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,770
Medical problems like the flu and
most other infections or

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,270
fractures are called
acute medical problems.

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,137
Because they either go away or can be
cured in a relatively short time frame.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,640
Chronic problems are,
by definition, not curable.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,095
The best we can do is help the patient
manage them so they don't get worse and

8
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:33,330
the often terrible complications
of these diseases,

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,220
including death either don't occur or
are delayed.
