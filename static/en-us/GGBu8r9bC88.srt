00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,420
Android wear devices have
a variety of screen technologies,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,870
each with their own advantages and
considerations.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,800
When designing ambient mode for
your Watch Face, you should consider

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,248
how it affects battery life and
screen burn in on different screens.

5
00:00:12,248 --> 00:00:15,705
You can configure your Watch Face to
display different ambient designs,

6
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:18,435
depending on the kind of screen
available on your device.

7
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,825
Consider the best design for
your watch faces on all screens.

8
00:00:21,825 --> 00:00:25,900
Some displays use a reduced color
spacing ambient mode to save power.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,544
One reduced color space parse saving
method is to use a low-bit mode.

10
00:00:29,544 --> 00:00:34,380
In low-bit mode the available colors
are limited to black, white, blue,

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,080
red, magenta, green, cyan and yellow,
as shown in this diagram here.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,990
So this means you cannot use anti-
aliasing, which is commonly used to blur

13
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,870
the edges of lines in text,
to make it look smooth.

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:52,110
You can see how the top ABC123,
looks much smoother than the bottom one.

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,330
You can't do this
smoothing in low-bit mode.

16
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,780
On displays like OLEDs,
eliminating pixels consumes power.

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,910
So the more pixels you can leave
as black, will be more efficient.

18
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,040
You should aim for
5% of pixels illuminated.

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,200
Other displays support
grayscale in ambient mode, so

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,360
you can support showing a background
image like you can see here.

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,470
Generally, you probably
want to keep things simple and

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,780
not show a background on any type of
device, but you can in this scenario.

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,040
As we said before, OLED displays
are capable of being always on and

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,630
have good power efficiency.

25
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,870
But it comes with the problem
of screen burning.

26
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,763
If pixels are illuminated constantly,

27
00:01:25,763 --> 00:01:28,722
they'll eventually be burned
into the display permanently.

28
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:31,730
So you should always
disable the background, and

29
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:36,190
keep 95% of the pixels truly black and
also avoid solid regions.

30
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,100
To avoid solid regions, you could
replace solid shapes, like these hands,

31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,395
with an outline and

32
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:45,240
hole out the center where the hands
meet, like in this image here.

33
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,310
The system actually giggles your
image by a few pixels every so

34
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,460
often to ensure that no pixels
are ever stuck being permanently on.

35
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,770
You might notice this as the watch
goes from interactive to ambient mode.

36
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,710
Here is a sped up view of a watch and

37
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,770
you can see the movement
of the screen over time.

38
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,970
Okay, let's due a quick quiz.

39
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,390
Let's match the appropriate watch face
with the watch hardware that we have.
