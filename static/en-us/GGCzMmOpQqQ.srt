1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,768
To add a smoother to this plot, we need to

2
00:00:02,768 --> 00:00:05,880
change geom line to geom smooth. We also need to

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,540
get rid of this fun.y parameter and the stat parameter.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,780
We'll still keep yearjoined.bucket assigned a color, so that way

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,219
we see this segment in our graph. And here I'm

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,620
using the defaults for geom smooth. So R will automatically

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,340
choose the appropriate statistical methods based on our data. All

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,610
of that additional information can be found in the output

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,020
down here. So here again, in this smooth version of the

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,750
graph, we still see that the friendships initiated declines as tenure increases.
