1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,170
So just reviewing in homogeneous coordinates, given two points, p1 and p2,

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,740
if I ask you to find the line, no problem.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,320
Just take their cross product, l is p1 p2.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,560
No algebra required while doing cross-product.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,490
No thinking about lines, equations or something Mrs.

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,690
Murphy taught you in eighth grade about how to go from.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,700
No, you just take the cross product.

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:26,982
Likewise, if I have two lines a1x, b1y, c1 equals zero.

9
00:00:26,982 --> 00:00:29,880
A2x plus b2y plus c2 equals zero, and

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,650
I want to know the intersection of those two lines.

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,240
That actually took a little bit of work in Mrs. Murphy's class, right?

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,160
If I gave you the equation of two lines and

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,270
I told you to find their intersection, you had to think about, well,

14
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,930
I have to sort of make them equal and solve these two sum.

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,140
No, you just cross them.

16
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,420
You know why Mrs. Murphy didn't teach you that?

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,150
She didn't know.

18
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,130
It's a long story about algebra teachers.

19
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,350
Anyway, cool.
