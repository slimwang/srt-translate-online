00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,294
Okay, let's have a quick quiz. So, which of these statements has a coalesced access pattern?

2
00:00:05,324 --> 00:00:09,155
Here's a simple kernel foo--it takes a pointer to global memory g.

3
00:00:09,155 --> 00:00:15,128
And as a shortcut, I'm going to define a as 3.14 and i as thread index dot x.

4
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:19,941
So now, each of these statements either reads or writes g or both.

5
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:22,622
And I'd like you to tell me, in each case,

6
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:27,245
whether the accesses to g follow a coalesced access pattern.
