00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,342
Now we have a formal f statistic. That is the ratio of between group

2
00:00:04,342 --> 00:00:09,290
variability to within group variability. If we could take all possible f

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,956
statistics, what would this distribution look like. Well let's start with what

4
00:00:13,956 --> 00:00:18,304
we know. The f statistic is always negative, sometimes negative or never

5
00:00:18,304 --> 00:00:19,690
negative.
