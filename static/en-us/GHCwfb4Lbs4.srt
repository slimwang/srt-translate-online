00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,385
Here's the answer. 3 has type int. 3, once, we have the dot. Now, it's not an

2
00:00:05,385 --> 00:00:09,922
integer, it's a float. And we've seen things behave differently, like division

3
00:00:09,922 --> 00:00:13,520
when our values have the dot after them. The reason for that was division

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,640
defined on floats means something different than division defined on integers.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,097
True it has type bool, it's a Boolean. None, the name of the type of None is

6
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:26,715
NoneType. So, None is actually a value. When a function doesn't return anything,

7
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:30,621
the value that we get back is actually a value of None, which is an object and

8
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:36,730
has the type NoneType. The string udacious is a string, its actual type is an

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,404
str. You can see that by doing type of udacious or any other string. We call it

10
00:00:41,404 --> 00:00:45,499
a string and it makes sense, that's easier to pronounce, but the actual name of

11
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:49,430
the type is str. This squiggles here, well, this creates an empty dictionary.

12
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,850
And dictionary has type dict. And finally the brackets, create an empty list,

13
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,193
which has typed list.
