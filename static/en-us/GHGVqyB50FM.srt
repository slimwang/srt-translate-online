00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,332
Now that you've got the software
installed and have logged in,

2
00:00:03,332 --> 00:00:04,971
here's some commands to try out.

3
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:08,054
Don't worry about what they mean yet,
just give a few of them a try.

4
00:00:08,054 --> 00:00:10,110
You'll see them all again later.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,340
If there are a few things here
that look familiar to you, cool.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,780
If not, don't worry.

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,250
By the end of the course,
these will all be old friends.
