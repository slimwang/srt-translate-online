00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,132
Let's start by considering the left side. To make this no longer a fraction, we

2
00:00:04,132 --> 00:00:08,330
need to multiply both sides to the equation by its denominator. However, doing

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,414
that alone doesn't help us with the right side. To deal with this fraction, we

4
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:16,474
need to multiply both sides by the quantity 4x plus 2. Now let's see what that

5
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:20,347
leaves us with. On the left side, multiplying by 7 minus 3x gets rid of the

6
00:00:20,347 --> 00:00:24,531
denominator, but then we still are multiplying by this other factor. I made a

7
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:28,499
mistake and forgot to write our parentheses around this entire factor we're

8
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:32,512
multiply by. That's super important, and clearly, it's very easy mistake to

9
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:36,782
make. On the right-hand side, since we're multiplying by 4x plus 2, that deals

10
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:41,571
with the denominator. But we still have a factor of 7 minus 3x. Wonderful. This

11
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:43,130
is our final answer.
