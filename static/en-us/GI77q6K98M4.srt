00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,976
Okay, so after all of that, that leads us into a new quiz. Which is, why

2
00:00:03,976 --> 00:00:05,780
do we separate our services? Check all that

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,700
apply. Is it so that they can be scaled

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,150
independently? Is it to increase the fault tolerance?

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,780
Is it so that two very different processes

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,710
aren't competing for resources on the same machine?

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,280
Or is it so they can be updated independently?
