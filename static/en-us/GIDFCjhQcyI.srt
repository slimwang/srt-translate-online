1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,850
So now that I can computer
rectangles very quickly,

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,050
I might want to look at
a lot of rectangles.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,104
And, in fact, for
training their boosted classifier,

4
00:00:10,104 --> 00:00:14,920
these guys looked at over
180,000 possible rectangles that

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,240
could be applied at,
sort of, a 24 by 24 window.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:19,960
Okay?
And here's

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,971
basically what they're going to do.

8
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:24,839
They're going to look for
face in 24 by 24 windows only.

9
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:27,577
And they're going to
take your new image, and

10
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:30,537
scale it to a couple different sizes,
and say,

11
00:00:30,537 --> 00:00:34,940
okay can I find it in anywhere
in that 24 by 24 window?

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,000
Okay, so we said the first main
idea was to use these patterns.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,840
Well, remember we just talked about
boosting where use, you look for

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,060
weak learners?

15
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:43,890
All right?

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,820
Well, basically they're going to choose
whichever features they can find that

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,188
tend to be the best weak learners.

18
00:00:51,188 --> 00:00:51,840
So they're going to use,

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,778
in fact they use a thing called
AdaBoost in order to do that.

20
00:00:54,778 --> 00:00:58,680
So you want to see which weak learners
reduced the weighted training error

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,220
the best?

22
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:00,960
Don't you?

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,110
>> Yeah.
>> Don't you, don't you?

24
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,942
Okay, well turned out these
are the first two features selected.

25
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:09,034
All right?
That is for a 24 by 24 window,

26
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:11,973
if you have a face in here somewhere.

27
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:15,230
Those are the features
that they're going to use.

28
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,720
And you might wonder why has
it become those features?

29
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,920
Well take a look at it this way, right?

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,730
It's basically looking for eyes,

31
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:29,210
sort of darkish patterns in there
compared to what's down here.

32
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,220
Okay?

33
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,370
And then, there's this patch here
that says the middle of the,

34
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,560
it tends to be brighter in
the middle than around the edges.

35
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,360
Just these two features,
these were your first two weak learners.
