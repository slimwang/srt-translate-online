1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,570
Okay, here's one possible assignment.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,200
And notice what I've done.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,270
After one completes, any one of these
three phases can begin executing.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,250
So I've assigned them all to phase 2.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,640
Now that's fine,
it's a valid assignment.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,240
But my PRAM only has two processors, so

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,670
I'm going to have to break
that phase up into two steps.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,150
That's essentially the slack
that the ceiling creates.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,350
Okay, so hopefully you now
have some intuition for

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,670
what Brent's Theorem means and
why it's an upper bound.

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,750
The other point I want to make is
that choosing this assignment of

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,520
work to processes and essentially
breaking down the execution into

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,700
phases is exactly what makes
scheduling such a tricky subject.
