1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now it's time to have some automatic control of the brake.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We want to set the wheel slip to 0.2, but actually the only thing that we can control is the brake.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We can't directly control the wheel slip.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So the job is to provide the right input to the brake so that the measured wheel slip is about 0.2.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's lot of things going on in between.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Think about the dynamics of the car, the surface of the road, and so on.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Situations such as these are studied in control theory.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
How to provide the right input to get the output that you want

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and this is the approach one would typically be using.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We found the difference of the optimum value and the actual current value to get the current error.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This is fed into a code controller, which as the name says controls the brake.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So what we are doing right now is more than just a simulation.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We're simulating the brake, the dynamics of the car, the sensors but in addition to that

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
we're also be going to design a controller.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's a piece of software or maybe hardware that's going to actually be part of that real car.
