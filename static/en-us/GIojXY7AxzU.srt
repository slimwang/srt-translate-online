1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,290
The idea is very simple.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,550
If your data has some structure and
your network doesn't have to

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,690
learn that structure from scratch,
it's going to perform better.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,850
Imagine for example, that you're
trying to classify those letters, and

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,980
you know that color is really not
a factor in what makes an A an A.

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,270
What do you think would be easier for
your classifier to learn?

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,830
A model that uses the color image or a
model that only looks at the grayscale.
