1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,040
All right. Let's here it.

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,980
>> Okay. So here's the process that I went through.

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,620
I'm just going to talk this out. I haven't actually worked it

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,039
out in my head yet. So what's the probability that there

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,920
isn't a storm? Well the way you have this drawn it

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,960
actually makes it pretty easy to see. I can just look

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,470
at the cases where storm is false, and it turns out

8
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,680
there's two of them. And I can just add those probabilities

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,310
over there, and I get .05 plus .30, and that gives

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:25,653
me .35.

11
00:00:25,653 --> 00:00:29,220
>> That's great. Yes, so that's exactly what

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,300
you did. So you went through, and now all

13
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,960
that matters in the universe are the cases where

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,040
they're not a storm and that ended up being

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,600
these two numbers. And you said, well Those are

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,110
two different cases that can happen. We'll just add

17
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,425
their probabilities because they're not overlapping and you've got

18
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:45,535
.35. Great. All right what about the second question?

19
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:47,560
>> Okay, so that's probability that there's

20
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,000
lightning in a world where there's a storm

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,580
so I'm going to do a very similar trick. I'm going

22
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,760
to look at the cases where storm happens to be true.

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,730
And conveniently they're the first two rows and I have

24
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,500
two cases, so we know the probability of there being a

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,250
storm is 0.65 which is good, because 0.65 and 0.35

26
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,380
add up to one. But that's not the probability of there

27
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,860
being lightening, given there is a storm. So, of those two

28
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,190
cases, there's only one where lightening is happening, windstorm is happening,

29
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:23,902
and that's 0.25. But 0.25 isn't enough because it's only 0.25 out of 0.65.

30
00:01:23,902 --> 00:01:24,390
>> Hm.

31
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,756
>> So the correct answer would be 0.25

32
00:01:26,756 --> 00:01:32,440
divided by 0.65. Which is, some number. 5 13th's?

33
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,620
>> Yeah. It's 5 13th's. And, though I'd

34
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,170
rather that people fill it in as a fraction.

35
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,180
>> As a, wait. That is a 5 13ths is a fraction.

36
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,220
>> Good point. As a point something something. A decimel.

37
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,030
>> So, 5 13ths is obviously 0.4615. And there you go. Is that right?

38
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,430
>> Yes. That was perfect. Yeah so its usually when there's a

39
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,870
storm, its not lightningy. It's less than half the time. That makes sense.

40
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,930
>> It does because otherwise lightning would be happening all the time.

41
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,430
>> Well when its storming. It could

42
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,970
be that its very likely when its storming.

43
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,230
>> It is likely when it's storming, but it wouldn't be happening

44
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,260
every time its storming because otherwise it would be lightning all the time

45
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:06,770
when its storming.

46
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,070
>> RIght.

47
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,729
>> And often there's breaks between lighting. In fact, most of the time

48
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,980
there's not lightning, at least outside my window. At 2pm. In the summer.
