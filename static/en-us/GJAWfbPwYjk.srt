1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,240
The next thing to do in our app is
to change the price of the coffee

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,880
in case someone orders a topping,
like whipped cream or chocolate.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,160
That's a good idea.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,170
If they order whipped cream,
then we'll just charge them $1.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,000
If they order chocolate,
then we'll charge them $2.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,620
>> Right.

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,070
Let's figure out how
to do this in the app.

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,970
Here are a couple of examples
in other Google apps,

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,390
where the behavior can change
based on certain conditions.

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,630
In the Inbox app from Gmail, here's
a screen shot of the list of emails.

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,590
For a single email,
if there is a reminder attached to it,

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,260
then the app knows to show this icon,
this label and the reminder text.

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,310
If an email has image attachments,

14
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,110
then the app knows to show
those images in line here.

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,040
If an email mentions a trip,

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,510
then a travel card shows up
with the flight information.

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,910
In the Google Now Launcher app,
we have more examples of how the app

18
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,610
behavior changes based
on certain conditions.

19
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,130
For example, if the stock price
is increasing, then the delta or

20
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,160
the increase in the price will be
shown here in green font color.

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,120
If the stock price is decreasing,

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,250
then the difference will be
shown here in a red font color.

23
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,140
For this weather card,
if the temperature is good and

24
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,260
the weather is sunny,
then we show a sun icon.

25
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,120
If the weather is windy or cloudy,
then we show different icons.

26
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,850
We'll be modifying our app shortly so

27
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,180
that the price changes based
on the toppings ordered but

28
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,100
first, I want you to become
familiar with control flow.

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,620
Normally, the code in our methods
gets executed from top to bottom,

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,820
line after line but
with control flow statements,

31
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,030
you can change that
instructions are executed in.

32
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,690
For example,

33
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:38,130
you can skip certain instructions
if certain conditions are met.

34
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,444
We're going to do this by
learning about if/else logic.

35
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,400
You haven't seen code for
if/else statements before but

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,470
I'm going to throw you in
the deep end and see how you do.

37
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,080
In the next couple of challenges, you're
going to read some code snippets on your

38
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,000
own, and these are linked
in the instructor notes.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,640
Then you're going to try to
guess what this code does and

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,550
try to determine the output.

41
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,200
You'll have several
options to choose from so

42
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,120
you can choose the best one
that matches this code.

43
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,390
When I say output,

44
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,008
I'm referring to the log statements
that get printed to the log cat.

45
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,510
Remember that you can access log cat
from this Android tab right here,

46
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,070
and it shows all the messages from
the system, and from our apps.

47
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,380
The code snippets that we're providing
to you are going to be writing messages

48
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,510
to the log here.

49
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,830
Let's do a sample question together.

50
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,310
You can find this link
in the instructor notes.

51
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,270
Assume that this is a code snippet
from a WeatherActivity.java file

52
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,830
within a weather app.

53
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,850
The first line of code creates
a boolean variable called isRaining and

54
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,910
the initial value is true.

55
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,500
Then we have this if/else statement.

56
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,150
If is raining is true,
then we write this to the logs.

57
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,330
It says, It's raining,
better bring an umbrella.

58
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,910
If is raining is false, then we go
into this else case and we write,

59
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,230
this message, It's unlikely to rain.

60
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,730
Since is raining is true,
then we fall into this case and

61
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,210
we write, It's raining,
better bring an umbrella.

62
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,780
Because we fall into this case, we can
skip the else block, this line of code

63
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,620
lives outside the if else statement so
it always gets executed.

64
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,670
It says, Thank you for
using the Whetherweather App.

65
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,520
Let's look for an option in
the quiz that shows, It's raining,

66
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,690
better bring an umbrella.,
immediately followed by, Thank you for

67
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,660
using the WhetherWeather App.

68
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,550
That's exactly option B.

69
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,870
Now here's a different problem for
you to try.

70
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,510
Check the notes for the code snippet and
then make your selection.
