00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,600
So let's talk about how to make truly scalable

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,410
pages. Now, HTML, by default, is supposed to reflow

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,390
text anyway. And text sizes are supposed to be

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,920
consistent. But the worst side effect of this viewport stuff,

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,400
by default, is that, even with nothing set, the

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,260
mobile browser is going to reflow text and render

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,540
as if the window were 980 pixels wide. And

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,000
then scale it to fit it on to the screen.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,360
This may mean that the text looks really small on

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,945
my mobile browser by default. So, the second way to use

11
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:33,990
viewport is if your page knows how to adapt to

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,100
width. For example, if it knows how to wrap the contents

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,030
based on the screen width. You can simply the width

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,680
to device width which tells the browser, my website knows how

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,420
to adapt to your width. This is really the best approach.

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,140
To build applications that scale their own layout and make intelligent

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,670
decisions about how to do so, rather than just

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,030
trying to scale a fixed layout to fit the screen.
