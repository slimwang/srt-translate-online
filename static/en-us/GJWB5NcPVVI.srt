1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,474
So matrix multiplication is one of the classic examples of bulk parallelism.

2
00:00:04,474 --> 00:00:07,317
Different threads can take different elements of the matrices,

3
00:00:07,317 --> 00:00:09,710
multiply them all together and combine them.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,216
Finding faces in photographs is task parallelism

5
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:19,062
because I am performing a similar operation on a large number of different input data sets.

6
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:24,509
Each photograph effectively amounts to a task, and I'm doing all of these tasks in parallel.

7
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:27,197
Binary search is a recursive algorithm.

8
00:00:27,197 --> 00:00:33,311
I repeatedly look through increasingly small subsets of my data to find the value that I'm looking for,

9
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:37,014
and parallel library calls from inside of a kernel amount

10
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:40,944
to creating new parallel work inside my existing kernel parallel work,

11
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:42,643
so that is nested parallelism.
