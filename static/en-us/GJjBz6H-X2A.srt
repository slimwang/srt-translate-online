00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,643
Here's a new curve that we might use to estimate population at different dates.

2
00:00:04,643 --> 00:00:08,423
You can see from the graph that it actually looks like it fits a fair number of

3
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:13,547
our points really closely. Remember, these green points are the coordinates of

4
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:17,138
what appeared on our chart before, showing the actual population for these

5
00:00:17,138 --> 00:00:22,840
years. Once again, using the link to Desmos in the instructor comments, what

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,815
does this blue curve predict the population will be in 2013? Thinking about

7
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:32,225
that, and comparing that to the last number that we saw from our red curve in

8
00:00:32,225 --> 00:00:36,770
the last question, does this curve give us a better prediction?
