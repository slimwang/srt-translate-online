As a quick reminder, UML classes are depicted as having up to

00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,210
three compartments, separated by horizontal lines.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,150
The top compartment, typically, has the name of the class in it.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,980
The middle compartment has the attributes of that class; the instance variables.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,510
And the bottom compartment has the methods or operations that class provides.
