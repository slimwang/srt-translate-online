00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,350
In flow monitoring, a monitor which might actually be running on the router

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,580
itself, records statistics per-flow. A flow

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,770
consists of packets that share a common

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,500
source and destination IP address, source

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,140
and destination port, protocol type, TOS byte

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,600
and interface, on which the packets arrive.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,580
A flow monitor can then record statistics

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,950
for a flow, that's defined by the group

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,820
of packets that share these features. The flow

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,790
records may also contain additional information, such as

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,140
the next hop IP address, and other information related

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,400
to routing. Such as the source and destination

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,790
AS on which those packets appear to be coming

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,910
from and going to, based on the routing

15
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,740
tables, as well as the prefix that those packets

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,970
matched in the routing table. Flow monitoring is

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,630
much less overhead than packet monitoring, but it's

18
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,090
also much more coarse than packet monitoring because

19
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,650
the monitor does not see individual packets or payloads.

20
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,450
Therefore, it's impossible to get certain information from

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,220
flow monitoring. Such as packet timing information. In

22
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,650
addition to grouping packets into flows based on

23
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,820
the fact that they share common elements in their

24
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,930
headers, typically packets are grouped into flows if they occur close

25
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,290
together in time. So for example, if packets that share

26
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,150
common sets of header fields do not appear for a particular

27
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,010
time interval, such as 15 or 30 seconds,

28
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,030
the router simply declares the flow to be

29
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,210
over, and sends a flow record to the

30
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,820
monitor based on the group of packets that it's

31
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,840
seen up to that point. Sometimes, to reduce monitoring

32
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,650
overhead, flow level monitoring may also be accompanied with

33
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:57,080
samples. Sampling builds flow statistics based only on samples

34
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,022
of the packets. So, for examples, flows may be created based on

35
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:07,000
one out of every ten or 100 packets. Or a packet

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,020
might be sampled with a particular probability

37
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,120
and flow statistics might only be tabulated based

38
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,000
on the packets that end up being sampled randomly from the total set of packets.
