00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,100
This is great. We've got our data frame, with our conditional

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,500
means measured in months. Now it's just time to plot them.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,380
Your final programming task here is to make the plot of

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,830
mean friend count versus age measured in months. Be sure that

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,370
you use a line to connect all the points. Just like

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,250
we did in this plot. Now I'm going to make this a

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,200
little bit harder. I want you to subset the data frame

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,560
as well. I want you to only investigate users, with ages less

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,390
than 71. The plot that you create won't be automatically graded so

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,840
I encourage you to check out what we did in the solution video.
