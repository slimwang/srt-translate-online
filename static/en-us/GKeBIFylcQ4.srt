00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,670
Today, we'd like to revisit the TextBrowser example that we started

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,830
the class with earlier. And this time we want to come at it from the point of

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:15,060
view of it's architecture. In particular, we want to suggest a process that

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,730
might be useful in actually performing an architectural design. Note that

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,560
this lesson uses UML diagrams and constraints to describe system architecture.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,319
And there are, there is a paper on the class resources page by Stirewatt and

7
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:33,810
Rugaber. That that comments on several of the points we're going to be making.
