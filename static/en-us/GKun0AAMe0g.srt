00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Alright. We noticed that all of these strings start with a lowercase a and S starts with capital A.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Why don't we have capital A goes to lowercase a just to get rid of this lowercase a at the beginning.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So, we don't have to worry as much about it.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now, I noticed that there can be some number of b's: bb, bb, one b, so one or more b's here,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and then sometimes, we've got c, and sometimes, we've got c d at the end.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, I'm going to make B C D be a list of one or more b's, and one way to do that is like this:

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
B C D goes to b, B C D. So here in the middle, after the a, we could either have no b's

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
or we could loop as many times as we want and pick up more b's,

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and now after that, it looks like we either need c, c d, or nothing.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, we have c. We got nothing, so we could also have c d.
