1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,460
We essentially ran through the red
green refractor process in our heads.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,500
I had some tests that were red.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,390
I turned those tests green by fixing my
code and I'm confident I could continue

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,280
refactoring my function
without breaking anything.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,360
But having these tests in our
head doesn't do us a lot of good.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,410
Let's get these down into code.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,770
I went ahead and
wrote the first two tests.

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,470
Now I would like you to try and
figure out the final one.

9
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,670
Don't focus much on these functions,
or what they do.

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,760
Just try and

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,492
take your best educated guess,
at how you would write, the final test.

12
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:36,752
Expect add 0.1, 0.2 to equal 0.3.

13
00:00:36,752 --> 00:00:40,110
Use my examples as references
to get yourself started.
