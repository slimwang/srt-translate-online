00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[Thrun] Wow! You learned a lot about hidden Markov models and particle filters.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Particle filters is the most used algorithm in robotics today

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
when it comes to interpreting sensor data,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but these algorithms are applicable in a wide array of applications

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
such as finance, medicine, behavioral studies, time series analysis, speech,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
language technologies, anything involving time and sensors or uncertainty.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And now you know how to use them.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You can apply them to all these problems if you listened carefully.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's been a pleasure teaching you with this class.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
As I told you in the beginning, this is a topic very close to my heart,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and I hope it's going to empower you to do better stuff

12
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in any domain involving time series and uncertainty.
