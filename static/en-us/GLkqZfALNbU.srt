1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:03,080
It's in UML, it's an association.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,080
We can't, as I said,

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,370
we can't express this entirely within the graphical notation.

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,090
We'll use UCL to do this, OCL to do this.

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,450
And later in the course we'll look more carefully at OCL.

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,780
For now, here's what the relationship looks like.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,950
It says that as far as this particular association, the LinesVisible

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:26,170
association, is concerned, there's, a fact or there's an invariant

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:32,189
that must hold that the size of the viewports must be equal to the minimum

10
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,281
of the size of the file manager and the size of the, of the viewport.
