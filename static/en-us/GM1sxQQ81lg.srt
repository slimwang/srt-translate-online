00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
[Norvig] There's a convention in situation calculus that predicates like At--

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we said plane P was at airport X in situation S--

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
these types of predicates that can vary from 1 situation to another are called fluents,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
from the word fluent, having to do with fluidity or change over time.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And the convention is that they refer to a specific situation,

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and we always put that situation argument as the last in the predicate.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now, the trickiest part about situation calculus is describing what changes

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and what doesn't change as a result of an action.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Remember in classical planning we had action schemas

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
where we described 1 action at a time and said what changed.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
For situation calculus it turns out to be easier to do it the other way around.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Instead of writing 1 action or 1 schema or 1 axiom for each action,

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
we do 1 for each fluent, for each predicate that can change.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We use the convention called successor state axioms.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
These are used to describe what happens in the state

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
that's a successor of executing an action.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And in general, a successor state axiom will have the form of saying

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
for all actions and states, if it's possible to execute action A in state S,

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
then--and I'll show in general what they look like here--

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:54,000
the fluent is true if and only if action A made it true

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,000
or action A didn't undo it.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So that is, either it wasn't true before and A made it be true,

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
or it was true before and A didn't do something to stop it being true.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
For example, I'll show you the successor state axiom for the In predicate.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And just to make it a little bit simpler, I'll leave out all the For All quantifiers.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So wherever you see a variable without a quantifier, assume that there's a For All.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What we'll say is it's possible to execute A in situation S.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If that's true, then the In predicate holds between some cargo C

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and some plane in the state, which is the result of executing action A in state S.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So that In predicate will hold if and only if either A was a load action--

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
so if we load the cargo into the plane, then the result of executing that action A

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
is that the cargo is in the plane--

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
or it might be that it was already true that the cargo was in the plane in situation S

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and A is not equal to an unload action.

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So for all A and S for which it's possible to execute A in situation S,

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
the In predicate holds if and only if the action was a load

37
00:03:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or the In predicate used to hold in the previous state and the action is not an unload.
