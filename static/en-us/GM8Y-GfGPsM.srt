00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,968
We see that the mean difference in caffeine consumed between freshmen and

2
00:00:04,968 --> 00:00:10,704
sophomores is 1.018. Therefore, since we're going the opposite way here,

3
00:00:10,704 --> 00:00:16,630
instead we're doing sophomores minus freshmen, this will be negative 1.018.

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,656
It's kind of hard to see the asterisks, but they mean that the difference is

5
00:00:20,656 --> 00:00:26,199
significant. This does not have an asterisk. So the amount of caffeine consumed

6
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,362
is not significantly different between freshmen and sophomores. For freshmen

7
00:00:31,362 --> 00:00:35,898
and juniors, you see that the mean difference is negative 2.909 when you're

8
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:42,428
going in this direction. Therefore, it's positive 2.909 when you go in the

9
00:00:42,428 --> 00:00:49,457
opposite direction. This also is not statistically significant. For juniors and

10
00:00:49,457 --> 00:00:54,917
sophomores, it'll be the opposite of negative 3.927. This also is not

11
00:00:54,917 --> 00:00:59,092
significant. Here are the rest of the differences, and those that are

12
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:02,998
significant are the difference between freshmen and seniors, and between

13
00:01:02,998 --> 00:01:05,731
sophomores and seniors.
