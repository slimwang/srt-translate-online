00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is no.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's look at our browser.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
When I click submit here, the URL updates just like it did before,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
with--this time the q parameter equals computer in our URL.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now, what's happening here when we hit enter and press submit

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
is that we're actually submitting the form.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And by default, the form submits to itself,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
which--while is neat for playing around in our browser--

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and--you know--editing the URL--isn't so handy.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So--let's talk about how we can make this form submit to someplace else.
