1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,050
Distributed query is securely
obtaining useful data

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,100
from diverse EHR systems and
other sources.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,840
We'll look at three current open
source distributed query technologies.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,980
They're different in their
technical approach and goals, and

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,060
understanding those differences and
the reasons for them is a key objective.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,600
This overall effort is now under the ONC
supported Query Health Initiative.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,200
I recommend you view an ONC video
referenced in the instructor's notes for

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,920
more details on the overall effort and

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,910
the individual systems
that comprised it.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,054
As we learned in the interview
with Wellcentive,

11
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:42,230
there are also commercial
solutions to this problem, but

12
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,770
those are proprietary and less
available for this kind of discussion.
