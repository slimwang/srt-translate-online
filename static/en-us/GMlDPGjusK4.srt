1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,900
So, why do you think these
commands have such short names?

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,870
>> There's a couple of
reasons I can think of.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,090
Short names are a bit cryptic,
but once you've learned them,

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,350
they're quick to type.

5
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,680
The second reason isn't
really relevant today, but

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,310
shorter commands
are also more efficient.

7
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,190
Back when modem speeds were measured
in the hundreds of bits per second,

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,020
every character counted.

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,890
>> From a historical standpoint,
making command names as short

10
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,360
as they could be was very common
when the UNIX system was created,

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,580
even though later on it looks kind
of silly and harder to learn.

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:33,390
For instance, the system function for
creating files is called creat,

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,960
not create, but creat without the e.

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,930
When Ken Thompson, one of the designers
of UNIX, was asked later what he would

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,400
have done differently in the design, he
said he would've put the e on the end.
