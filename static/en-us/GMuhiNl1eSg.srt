1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,019
When you think about ways to describe yourself, Lauren, what do you think about?

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,500
>> Well, there's physical traits, like, you know, height or body shape, and

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,630
then, well, there's personality traits like extroversion

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,560
or introversion, and then there's my interests,

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,580
so like music or art. So there are many features we could use

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,240
to describe an individual, and we call

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,000
these traits. Traits are any distinguishing feature

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,080
of an individual. For example, Lauren, if you had

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,500
to describe yourself in three traits, what would you say?

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,520
>> well, I have light hair. I'm outgoing. And I'm really into psychology.

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,110
>> Yeah, absolutely. I think I would say that I'm tall, I'm pretty friendly,

12
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:51,070
outgoing as well, and I'm a huge lover of the Zelda series of video

13
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,030
games from Nintendo.

14
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,990
>> So, are you saying that all of our traits

15
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,760
come from our genome? Well to a certain extent we're

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,050
saying that all of these attributes are traits, but the

17
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,510
extent to which they're influenced by our genome is variable.

18
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,310
>> Okay, because I was going to say, things like

19
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,720
my personal interests I don't think come from the genome.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,950
>> Sure. I mean things like height are, are

21
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,939
things that we suspect would have a major genetic component.

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,840
whereas my general love of video games, probably

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,750
has less to do with my genetics, and a

24
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,170
lot more to do with my environment. For our

25
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,210
purposes in this course, we'll use three main categorizations

26
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,450
for traits. We'll have physical vs. behavioral traits,

27
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,620
visible vs. hidden traits. An innate versus learned traits.

28
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,400
So let's see if you can classify height for

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,010
each of this categories. Is it physical or behavioral?

30
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,860
Is it visible or is it hidden? Or is it

31
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,100
innate or is it learned? Check out the boxes that apply.
