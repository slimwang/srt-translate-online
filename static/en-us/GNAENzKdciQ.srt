Hi, I'm Ilya Grigorik, developer advocate, and web performance engineer at

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,070
Google. Which is to say, I like to make things fast.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,570
>> And I'm Cameron Pittman. I'm a course

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,300
developer here at Udacity. Pretty new to web development,

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,820
which means I've made a few pages in the

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,970
past, but never optimized any of them for speed.

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,110
>> Developing a great website requires that you

8
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,680
understand your users and what they want to

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,680
achieve, but also how the browser works, so

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,140
you can build a fast and great experience.

11
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,630
>> Right. You know, I recently

12
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,900
ran my page through PageSpeed Insights. And I, well,

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,140
my score was pretty low, and I got some suggestions

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,230
I didn't quite understand. Like, for instance, how do

15
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,060
I remove render blocking JavaScript, and what are asynchronous scripts?

16
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,920
>> You know what, those are great

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,800
questions. And you're definitely not the only one.

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,530
Both of the optimizations that you've asked about

19
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,080
have to do with critical rendering path, which

20
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,030
is the sequence of steps the browser goes through to render the page. And I

21
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,240
think a lot of us take it for granted that the browser does all the work,

22
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,870
but once you understand how the browser

23
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,120
constructs dom, the cssom subject model layout

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,020
and paint, you can reliably build pages that rendered in less than one second.

25
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,940
>> Wow. One second. That is awesome. I would love to have all my

26
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,260
pages rendered in less than a second. What do I need to get started?

27
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,160
>> Well, to start how about an hour of your

28
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,370
time. We're going to take a ground up view of how the

29
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,480
browser constructs the page and once you know that I

30
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,470
think you'll be in great shape to answer your own questions

31
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,930
about how to optimize your own page.

32
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,390
>> Awesome. Let's do it.

33
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,780
>> Actually, one more thing before we get

34
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,430
started. I want you to write down some thoughts

35
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,600
about what you want to get out of this course and what you would like to learn.

36
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:26,800
>> Okay.
