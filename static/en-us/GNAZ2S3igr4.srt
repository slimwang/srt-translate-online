1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,667
If we look at just the US Chess Federation.

2
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:06,266
This is the rating distribution as of 2004.

3
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:10,467
Bear in mind that the first bin is about 200,

4
00:00:10,467 --> 00:00:13,000
Whereas all the other bins are size 100.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,834
If my rating is 1800,

6
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:19,700
then I am about 8110th place in the US,

7
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:23,100
But this is better than approximately 88%.

8
00:00:23,242 --> 00:00:27,838
Therefore, another really important thing about the shape of distributions. And

9
00:00:27,838 --> 00:00:32,394
what we're interested in throughout the rest of this course is the proportion of

10
00:00:32,394 --> 00:00:36,772
data values, less than or greater than a certain value in the data set. So if I

11
00:00:36,772 --> 00:00:41,056
tell you that my rating is 1800, you really don't know what that means until I

12
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:45,022
tell you the shape of the distribution of ratings. And you can see the

13
00:00:45,022 --> 00:00:46,050
proportion less.
