1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,508
Congratulations.

2
00:00:02,508 --> 00:00:06,195
>> Congratulations on completing this
introductory course on JavaScript.

3
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:09,149
>From defining your first variables,
to writing functions,

4
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:12,054
to creating your very own objects,
you've come a long way.

5
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:13,368
>> In just a short amount of time,

6
00:00:13,368 --> 00:00:17,012
you've built up a basic understanding of
the JavaScript programming language, and

7
00:00:17,012 --> 00:00:19,750
how it works
>> If this is your first time learning

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,269
a programming language, you should
be incredibly proud of yourself.

9
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:24,117
>> But the fun doesn't stop here.

10
00:00:24,117 --> 00:00:26,359
Now, it's time for
you to venture forth, and

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,190
use your new JavaScript powers
to see what you can create.

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,826
We also hope you'll consider taking our
follow-up course if you're interested in

13
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:36,222
learning how to use JavaScript to create
interactive experiences on the web.

14
00:00:36,222 --> 00:00:37,350
>> See you in the next course.

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:47,350
