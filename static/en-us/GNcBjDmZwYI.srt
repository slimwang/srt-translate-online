00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,540
Let's look at the solution
to our False Sharing Quiz.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,930
We have two blocks, a block that has A,
B, C, and D in it, and

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,870
a block that has X, Y, Z, and W in it.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,910
We're looking for which of these,
if any, have false sharing misses.

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,100
So let's first look at this one.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,870
There is a read X and a write X.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,650
The first will be a miss.

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,950
The second will also be a miss.

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,870
Both of these are compulsory misses.

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,520
X wasn't in C0's cache.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,240
X wasn't in C1's cache, so
they have to be compulsory misses.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,910
Read A here is also a compulsory miss.

13
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,780
This block wasn't in C2's cache.

14
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,030
Finally, C3 is writing to B.

15
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:54,650
This block wasn't in C3's cache so
this also a compulsory miss.

16
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,220
So in fact, this sequence has
no coherence misses whatsoever.

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,462
All of them are compulsory misses.

18
00:01:00,462 --> 00:01:02,290
Now let's look here.

19
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,849
This is a compulsory miss for C0.

20
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:08,060
This is a compulsory miss for C1.

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,270
This is a compulsory miss for C2.

22
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,670
And this is a compulsory miss to C3.

23
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,810
So regardless,
whether we had coherence or

24
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,510
not, these four accesses
would be misses because

25
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,730
each of these caches needs to fetch
the block for the first time.

26
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,490
So there are no coherence
misses in this sequence either.

27
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,960
Now, let's look here.

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,032
C0 reads X.

29
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:36,429
C1 writes to X.

30
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,965
This invalidates X in C0.

31
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:46,283
This invalidation needs to happen
in order for X to be written in C1.

32
00:01:46,283 --> 00:01:49,330
C2 now writes to W.

33
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,280
That invalidates the data in C1's cache.

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,460
The data in C0's cache was already
invalidated at that point.

35
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:04,000
When C0 tries to read X, the reason
it doesn't have the data in its cache

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,639
is because C1 invalidated it, and
C1 was accessing the same word.

37
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,580
So this is an example of true sharing.

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,360
We got invalidated because somebody
was trying to write the same word

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,090
that we were accessing.

40
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,340
So this is actually a sequence
of three compulsory misses,

41
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,750
followed by a true
sharing coherence miss.

42
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,900
So in this sequence there is
also no false sharing, so

43
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,060
none of these should have been selected.
