00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,050
Incremental concept learning
is intimately connected with

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,560
human cognition.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,710
We can adopt two views of learning.

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,150
In one view of learning,

5
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,470
the intelligent agent is given
with a large number of examples.

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,570
The agent's task, then, is to detect
patterns of regularity in those examples

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,050
and learn those patterns of regularity.

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,540
In the alternative view, the agent
is given one example at a time.

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,800
And the agent has to gradually,

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,820
incrementally learn concepts
out of those examples.

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,729
Now you and I as agents,
as cognitive agents in our daily lives,

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,800
deal with one example at a time.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,790
Rarely is it that we
encounter millions or

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,610
hundreds of thousands of
examples given at once.

15
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:45,950
Incremental concept learning is
a lot closer than kind of learning

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,490
that you and I as cognitive agents do.
