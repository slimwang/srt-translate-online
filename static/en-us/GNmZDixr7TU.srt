00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,816
These are the boxes that should have been checked off. We can find curves of

00:00:03,816 --> 00:00:09,130
the graph in three different areas, over here, down here, and up here again.

00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,997
Let me show you the full version of the graph so you can get a real picture of

4
00:00:11,997 --> 00:00:17,230
what it looks like. These black curves represent the graph of this function.

00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,090
It's pretty incredible to think about how different this looks from any other

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,228
rational function we've look at so far. This is just testament to the

7
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:27,648
incredible wide variety of graphs and functions we have in the ratinoal

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,602
function family.
