1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So now we're ready for a quiz to see if you understand nested lists.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
For this quiz, you're given a variable named "countries,"

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and it's defined with a list of information about some of my favorite countries.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And for each country, there's a list containing 3 things:

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the name of the country, the capital, and its population in millions.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I should point out, of course, for those of you in Romania or in smaller countries,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that when it comes to countries, bigger is not always better.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
First, try to write code that will print out the capital of India.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We can find India as the second country in our countries list.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And the capital is the second element of that list.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You obviously could solve this by just printing out "Delhi."

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't want you to solve it that way.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I want you to solve it by finding an expression that uses the countries variable

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
to find the right value.
