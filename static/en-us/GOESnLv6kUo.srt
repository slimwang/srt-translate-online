00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,950
To solve this equation, we substitute the source color into here and the

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,686
background color into here. And we multiply by the alpha in both cases. We get

3
00:00:09,686 --> 00:00:17,170
these intermediate results. And when we add them together, we get 0.90, 0.41,

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,896
0.19. The demo that follows, shows the result of this particular exercise. Try

5
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:25,793
varying the alpha and the colors to see the effect.
