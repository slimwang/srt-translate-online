00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,610
The general message that I want you to take away from this discussion is that

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,570
features and information are two different things.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,670
What you really want out of your data is information.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,070
You want to be able to draw conclusions and have insights.

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:15,710
And that's not,

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,080
strictly speaking, the same thing as having lots of features in the data.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,900
So the feature is the actual number or characteristic of

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,580
a particular data point that's attempting to access information.

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,240
But it's not exactly the same as information itself.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,730
So for example, it's a little bit like the difference between the quantity of

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,430
something and the quality.

12
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,920
If you have lots of feature you might have a lot of quantity of data.

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,020
The quality of those features is the information content.

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,220
So, in general, what you want is the bare minimum number of

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,140
features that it takes to give you as much information as possible.

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,080
If there's a feature present that isn't giving you information,

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,840
you want to get rid of it, because it can cause all of those problems that we

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,710
were talking about in the last video.
