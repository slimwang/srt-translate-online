00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,666
>> These equations are not in slope-intercept form so it would be pretty tough

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:07,547
to use graphing. We'd have to do a lot of rearranging and then plot points. If

3
00:00:07,547 --> 00:00:11,264
we were graphing, we could have also made tables, but that could take a lot of

4
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:14,955
work, too. So, I'm going to take out graphing. If we want to use substitution,

5
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:19,081
we need one of the equations solved for one variable. This one is almost solved

6
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:23,223
for x. All I would need to do would be to subtract 3 from both sides. Then, I

7
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:27,428
could perform substitution. So, x could equal 2y minus 3 and now, I'd be ready

8
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:31,910
to substitute this in to my first equation for x. That's a pretty great choice.

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,271
If you were leaning towards elimination, you might have thought to multiply the

10
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:41,099
second equation by negative 5. If we distribute the negative 5, we would get

11
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:46,131
negative 15 minus 5x minus 10y. Now, we could add these equations together. I

12
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:51,029
would want to switch the places of these two terms so that way I could add my x

13
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:55,723
terms together more easily. Now, I'm actually ready to do elimination. And I

14
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:59,889
would get negative 4y minus 15 equals negative 10y plus 9. Notice I can't

15
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:04,515
combine these, because their not like terms. This has a y and this doesn't. This

16
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:09,045
also has a y and this doesn't. This isn't so great with elimination. I'm having

17
00:01:09,045 --> 00:01:13,885
to do a lot of steps, and I'm having to reorder a lot of terms. So, that's why I

18
00:01:13,885 --> 00:01:16,730
think substitution is the best here.
