realistic. Change the following materials to use the Mesh Phong Material. The

Hat, Body, Leg, and Foot should all use this material. Assign the shininess, and

00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:15,762
also assign the specular color to be this. Note that the specular color is

00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:19,532
different than the material color. You should check the online documentation to

00:00:19,532 --> 00:00:23,411
make sure you're setting the right color. When you're done, the results should

definitely look shinier like this.
