00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,982
So I think one of the really unique things about computer programming is that,

2
00:00:04,982 --> 00:00:09,310
the first time you run your program, it's not going to work. And you shouldn't

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,790
expect it to work. And people get really frustrated, because that's not

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,640
something that they've seen in other places. And so my advice for anyone

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,050
learning to computer program, whatever point you're at, would be to fail

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:28,570
forward. It's about writing code, and running a program, and having it not

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,090
compile. And not run. And while that can be really, really frustrating, you'll

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,710
see that bug ten times later and you'll understand why that bug is there. And

9
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,475
you'll be faster at it. And in the end, you don't when your program just runs,

10
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:46,660
because you don't fundamentally understand why that happened. And so. Just fell

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,660
forward and learn from your mistakes and be okay with this kind of incremental

12
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,230
process.
