1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,150
Here's what you should've marked.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,290
This set of vertices and

3
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,040
edges in the original graph is
called the projected separator.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,620
Let me first point something
out about this separator, and

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,730
then I'll walk you through how I got it.

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,580
See this triangle here?

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,450
It includes two unnecessary edges.

8
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,064
You really only need this sub-path.

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,230
So the main point is that if you
use the coarsening technique,

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,030
you will probably need to refine
the partitions that you get.

11
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,000
The readings discuss this
point in more detail.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,880
Now, in case you didn't
get the same separator,

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,110
let me walk you through the process.

14
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,650
I did the first separator edge for
you, so let's move on to the second.

15
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,450
This edge comes from the original graph.

16
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,210
This edge comes from the super vertex.

17
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,610
Okay, what about the next edge?

18
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,560
It's basically the same thing.

19
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,200
This next edge is the interesting one.

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,600
The separator edge maps ambiguously to
these two edges of the original graph.

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,502
The last two separator edges
are similar to the first few.
