00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,930
When we press this button, we want to
let the location services know about

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,790
the list of Geofences
that we're working with.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,120
And this is called adding
the list of Geofences.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,232
To do this,
in LocationServices.GeofencingApi,

5
00:00:12,232 --> 00:00:17,460
there's a method called addGeofences and
addGeofences requires these parameters.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,750
First is the GoogleApiClient,
which you'll have already.

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,270
Then it's the Geofencing Request,
which you're going to create shortly and

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,950
then it's the Geofencing Pending Intent
which you created earlier on.

9
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,210
It also requires you to set
a callback called onResult,

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,740
and we'll see how to
create that shortly.

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,460
You've already implemented
your GoogleApiClient, so

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,490
let's take a look at the others
starting with this Geofencing request.

13
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,080
Check this box when
you're ready to continue.
