1
00:00:00,395 --> 00:00:04,700
Now we need to add the buttons for
the slow and fast playback of the audio.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,550
For this we're going to
use two UI buttons.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,710
With the main story board open and
the play sounds view control selected,

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,560
let's search for button in the object
library in the bottom right.

5
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:18,560
Drag that UI button to the document
outline directly under

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,690
the horizontal Stack View.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,620
In the attributes inspector remove
the word button underneath the title.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,940
In the image drop down
select the SnailButton.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,455
In the document outline single
click to select this button and

10
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:33,135
let's rename it to the SnailButton.

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,900
Now let's set the RabbitButton
with the same steps.

12
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:42,065
Drag a UI button under the horizontal
Stack View underneath the SnailButton.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,430
In the attributes inspector for this
button, let's erase the title and for

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,120
the image, let's select the Rabbit.

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,190
Finally, single click on
this button to select it and

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,820
let's change the name to RabbitButton.

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,118
That's all it takes to add
buttons into a Stack View.

18
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:01,360
Next, we'll add the buttons for
Darth Vader and

19
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,640
squirrel sound effects, as well
as another horizontal Stack View.
