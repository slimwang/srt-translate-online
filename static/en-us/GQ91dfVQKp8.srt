1
00:00:00,022 --> 00:00:05,020
[SOUND] That was beautiful.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,745
>> That was tiring.

3
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:06,557
>> It was tiring.

4
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:09,323
That was a very long,
long, long flashback.

5
00:00:09,323 --> 00:00:11,009
>> It was like two whole
lessons of flashback.

6
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:13,367
>> Two whole lessons of flashback,
hence Game Theory III.

7
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:14,850
>> All right, well now that we're back.

8
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,881
[LAUGH] Is there anything left to say or
do we basically cover everything?

9
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:20,223
>> Well, I think we covered
almost everything, but

10
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:22,509
if you recall from
the flashback there were two or

11
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:25,431
three things we said were probably
best left for another day.

12
00:00:25,431 --> 00:00:25,966
>> Yeah.
>> And

13
00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:27,677
it turns out that today is another day.

14
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:29,529
>> Not according to that video, right.

15
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,460
If they watch that video now,
then today is that day.

16
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,330
>> Every single person who
watch those videos had to take

17
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,020
several days to do it.

18
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,840
>> All right, that's fair.

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,078
>> At least emotionally, so
I'm going to claim it's another day.

20
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:41,589
And so we're going to talk about three
things that we said that we wanted to

21
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:42,593
talk about before.

22
00:00:42,593 --> 00:00:46,183
In particular, we're going to
talk about solution concepts.

23
00:00:46,183 --> 00:00:49,140
And we're going to spend a little bit
of time talking about mechanism design.

24
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,460
>> Neat.
>> So, let's start with some

25
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,210
solution concepts.
