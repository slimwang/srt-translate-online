00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,839
And welcome back to computer vision.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,770
With today's lesson and the next we're going to close a circle that

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,000
we started it seems like forever ago.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,207
I remember we were talking about trying to compute transformations between

5
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:15,011
images, and we talked about doing panoramas and mosaics, and o,

6
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:16,961
and other ways of doing this, and we said, and

7
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:20,260
also when we're talking about fundamental matrices.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,450
Key to all of these things was if we knew the correspondences,

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,665
you could compute the various transforms whether it's or something else.

10
00:00:27,665 --> 00:00:30,191
Then we talked about competing features, and

11
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:33,220
feature points detections, and descriptions.

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,200
So today we'll finish the story,

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,590
where we're going to actually do the approach for doing feature-based alignment.

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,880
We'll describe it as a form of model fitting,

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,740
since, really that's what you're doing, we'll show you more about that.

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,170
And then, we'll talk about a really cool method that let's you effectively find

17
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,250
the best global solution, or probabilistically the best global solution,

18
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,290
without being too exhaustive, too combinatorically challenging.
