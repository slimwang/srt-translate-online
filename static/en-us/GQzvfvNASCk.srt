1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,230
Okay so we have seen that we have to worry about the read after write

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,530
dependencies because we actually have to feed the value that the instruction

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,650
needs, from a previous instruction. We also have to worry about write after

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,700
write dependencies possibly because we don't want, we want the last instruction

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,900
in the program order to be the last one to actually. Write the result. And

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,561
also anti dependencies we need to worry about them too because, we don't want to

7
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:26,760
overwrite results before the instructions that need them have had a chance to

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,330
use them. So, now we're going to talk about removing false dependencies.

9
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:36,580
What are false dependencies? Well, we have read after write.

10
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:43,940
We have write after read. And we can also have a write after a write. These,

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,150
are called true dependencies. Because, you actually have to obey them,

12
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,850
that's how the program computes. Some instructions produce values that are then

13
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,325
used by other instructions and so on. So the instructions that use values really

14
00:00:56,325 --> 00:01:03,480
depend on instructions that previously wrote the results. In contrast, these.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,540
Are called, false or name, dependencies. Why?

16
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,900
Well, because there is nothing fundamental about them.

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,280
They are dependencies just because you're using the same register for

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,155
two different results. So, for example, in a write after write dependency we

19
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:23,490
have seen that two different instructions would write to the same register and

20
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,610
that creates the write after write dependence. If the second of those two

21
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,810
instructions, were using another register to write this value,

22
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,120
then there would not, be no dependents. We will see an example of this a little

23
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,680
bit later. But the idea is that while true dependencies,

24
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,220
you actually. Have to delay instructions in order to satisfy them,

25
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,820
with the name dependencies you could actually execute instructions earlier.

26
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,330
If only you could take care of, you know kind of multiple values for

27
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,560
the same register as we will see just in case, just in a couple of seconds.
