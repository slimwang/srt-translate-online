1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,760
So now we're ready to talk in general about the problem of shape from shading.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,495
So the basic problem is this, given say, one, maybe more, but for

3
00:00:10,495 --> 00:00:15,647
now one image, that looks like either this top image or the bottom image,

4
00:00:15,647 --> 00:00:20,154
can you, you the computer, recover for me a function Z of x,y.

5
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:23,360
So this, that's why it's going to map under this gradient space nicely.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,093
So we're imagining that we've just got a single viewpoint,

7
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,674
you can think of Z as coming towards me, and

8
00:00:29,674 --> 00:00:33,435
I want to know the height of the function as I go over the image.

9
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:36,201
By the way, this is just one representation of depth,

10
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:39,660
it's a very viewpoint-specific representation of depth.

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,720
If I had multiple cameras and

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,115
I had different viewpoints, then the notion of Z as a function of

13
00:00:45,115 --> 00:00:48,960
x,y would not be a great representation of the geometry that's out there.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,110
And in fact, much later in the class, we'll talk about other depth sensors and

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,630
things like point clouds, which is a different way of representing geometry.

16
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,120
But for here, we're just talking about Z as a function of x,y.

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,180
So, the fundamental question is, given this single image,

18
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,700
can we recover the 3D shape.

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,950
Well, as we talked about when we did lightness, fundamentally, this is an ill

20
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,530
posed problem, right, because I don't know what the underlying albedo is, and

21
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,010
I don't, may, not know what the illumination is.

22
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,046
So there could be lots of different shapes and

23
00:01:21,046 --> 00:01:24,540
combinations of illumination, albedo, that would give the same image.

24
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,410
So, as I said, this is ill-posed.

25
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,260
In order to solve this, we have to make some form of assumptions.

26
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,170
And those assumptions can be, the lighting is known, so

27
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,010
I know the direction of the light, maybe I'm assuming that it's Lambertian.

28
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,460
And that it's the same albedo everywhere.

29
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,960
That would be an example.

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,870
Or maybe I say that I know what the boundary conditions are.

31
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,450
What we're going to have to do is, we're going to have to bring in some,

32
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,700
some other kinds of assumptions to make this work.
