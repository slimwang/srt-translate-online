00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,350
We've come up with, as solutions to the equation, log base 10 of 5x plus log

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:11,750
base 10 of x minus 1 equals 2. Are x equals 5 and x equals negative 4.

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,500
Something doesn't seem quite right here, though. What do you think would happen

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,439
if we substituted in either these values of , in the spots of x in our

5
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,480
equation. Would both of these inputs give values of our function that are

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,920
allowed? Think carefully about the domain of the log function. So which

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,833
solutions are correct?
