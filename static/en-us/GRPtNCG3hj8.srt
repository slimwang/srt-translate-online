00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,282
So, how do we know if there are no long words? Well, if there are no long words

2
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:09,080
then long word will be an empty string. So, if long word dot equals the empty

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,565
string. And remember, we use dot equals because strings are objects then we

4
00:00:13,565 --> 00:00:18,860
want to print out the message there are no long words. Otherwise, there is a

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,690
long word and we print that out. Now, if I run this looking for words with

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,806
length greater than 30, well, that's interesting. It looks like there is a word

7
00:00:26,806 --> 00:00:32,310
with more than 30 characters. It's just joined up with a whole bunch of dashes.

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,488
I bet there aren't any words longer than 60 characters though. That would just

9
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:39,469
be crazy, right? Alright, looks like this time we got, there are no long words.
