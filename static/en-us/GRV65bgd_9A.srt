00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,520
We already know how many glasses wiper sets were made in the first 4 days, which

2
00:00:04,532 --> 00:00:08,914
is this quantity down here, and we can also see in our given information, how

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:13,535
much making these glasses wipers cost, which is this quantity over here. Now the

4
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:18,075
only quantity of these 3 that we don't already have a number for, from our given

5
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:22,185
information, is the cost per wiper set. So this is the thing that we need to

6
00:00:22,197 --> 00:00:26,400
represent with a variable, since we don't have any other number to replace it

7
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:26,870
with yet.
