00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,070
The goal of the Arden Syntax

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,559
is to provide a standard approach to
describing medical logic so that it can

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:12,360
be shared across EMRs to support
Clinical Decision Support or CDS.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,880
CDS is the idea that computers
can suggest optimal therapy

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,570
based on a patient's electronic record.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,020
Or spot potential mistakes
before they happen.

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,590
To do either, they not only
need the electronic record,

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,000
they need to understand at least
a limited domain of medicine.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,400
That's where Arden comes in.

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,070
Arden consists of medical logic modules,

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:41,150
or MLMs,
each supports one clinical decision.

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:46,920
Here's a group of five MLMs used to
provide clinical decision support for

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,950
the use of Warfarin, a common but
potentially dangerous blood thinner

14
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,920
often given to patients with strokes or
other potential blood clotting problems.

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,750
Too little of the drug
may mean another stroke.

16
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,140
Too much can cause excessive,
or even fatal, bleeding.

17
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,840
Warfarin levels can be effected by many
other drugs and even the patient's diet.

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,060
So it's a very tricky drug to manage.

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,139
A clinical test called PT/INR is used
to assess the degree of blood thinning.

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,180
You can see here that the modules,

21
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,450
once they are fed clinical data about
the patient, such as their PT/INR,

22
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,010
can make Warfarin dosage
recommendations to the physician.

23
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:35,920
I refer you to the text for
the internal details of the Ardent MLMs.
