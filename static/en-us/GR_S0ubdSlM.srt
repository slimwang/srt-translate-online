00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,566
When starting the problem, we want to recall that the negative 3 has an exponent

2
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:08,699
of 1. Now, we can raise each of these bases to this power of 3. We multiply

3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:13,119
every exponent on the inside of the parentheses by the exponent on the outside

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,411
of the parentheses. And we get negative 3 to the 3rd, b to the 12th, c to the

5
00:00:17,411 --> 00:00:22,477
6th. The negative of 3 to the 3rd is negative 27. I regroup my numbers together

6
00:00:22,477 --> 00:00:27,748
and my variables with the same basis together. Finally, I multiply the numbers

7
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:32,810
and I add the exponents. Our final answer is negative 54 times B to the 15th

8
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,146
times c to the 11th. Fantastic work if you got it.
