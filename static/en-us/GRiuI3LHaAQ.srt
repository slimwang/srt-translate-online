1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
To evaluate the game tree, we work from the bottom up.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's start over here. This is a min node.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Min chooses the minimum, which will be 1.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In this position, Min would choose 2, the minimum of 2 and 4.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Over here Min would choose 0, the minimum of 0 and 10.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now we have some chance nodes, so we have to choose the expected value.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Chance, the flip of the coin, doesn't get the choice of one direction or the other.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Rather both of them are possibilities.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So we just average the results, since the probability of heads and tails are equal.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So 7 and 1 is 8, divided by 2 is 4, and 8 and 2 is 10 over 2 is 5 is the expected value there.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The expected value of 0 and 6 is 3, and the expected value of 0 and 4 is 2.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now we have a maximizing node. The max of 5 and 4 would be 5.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The max of 3 and 2 would be 3, and finally, we have another chance node.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The average of 5 and 3 would be 4, and that's the value of the final state.
