1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,344
Today we will talk about Meta-Reasoning.

2
00:00:02,344 --> 00:00:06,110
Meta-Reasoning is thinking about
thinking, knowledge about knowledge.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,090
In this case,

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,460
the agent does not reasoning about
something outside in the world.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,530
Instead, the agent is
reasoning about itself, but

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,620
its own knowledge,
its own reasoning, its own learning.

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,800
As an example, I can ask you what is
President Obama's telephone number?

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,623
I'm sure that all of you can
immediately tell me, you don't know.

9
00:00:24,623 --> 00:00:27,577
But how do you know,
that you don't know?

10
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:30,657
We test a little bit about
meta-reasoning when we were talking

11
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:33,330
about learning by correcting mistakes.

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,180
There, we were interested in
errors in the knowledge base.

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,050
In journal, errors can also be
in reasoning or in learning.

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,070
We'll start today by talking
about mistakes in reasoning and

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,320
learning, in addition to
mistakes in knowledge.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,670
Then we'll talk about knowledge gaps,
not just errors in the knowledge, but

17
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,170
when some knowledge is actually missing.

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,690
Then we'll talk about a very
journal meta-cognitive skill,

19
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,610
which leads to strategy selection and
integration.

20
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,860
And this class, we have talked about
a large number of methods, but

21
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,360
we haven't yet talked about how
an intelligent agents can put

22
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,030
multiple methods together to
address a complex problem.

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,390
Then we'll discuss meta-meta-reasoning.

24
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,500
Or meta-meta-meta-reasoning,
how far can we go?

25
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,800
Finally, we'll discuss an example
of meta-reasoning election

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,880
that is sometimes called
goal-based autonomy.
