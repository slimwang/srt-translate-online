1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
There's another way to look at this types of value propositions, kind of as a Venn diagram.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,310
What comes from technical insights are making things more efficient

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,200
or smaller or faster and sometimes lower cost and simpler.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,430
What comes from market insights are better distribution and bundling and branding.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,510
But sometimes what you have is this sweet spot in the middle

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,050
that actually is a combination of technical and market insights

7
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:26,754
that makes for a killer value proposition.

8
00:00:26,754 --> 00:00:29,608
So let's take a look at some examples of technical insights.

9
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:31,411
This is a company called Ayasdi.

10
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:36,271
That was an outgrowth of Stanford math department where Phd students said

11
00:00:36,277 --> 00:00:41,728
"Listen we can do a topological analysis of highly dimensional data to be analysed

12
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,995
without predetermining the number of feature sets."

13
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:49,807
That's a mouthful but it turns out that this is the world's best way to go through

14
00:00:49,807 --> 00:00:56,280
big data sets, huge data sets in a way that was just computationally not possible before.

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,060
And in fact once they had their technical insight

16
00:00:59,063 --> 00:01:03,120
they started to talk to customers about pains and gains.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,367
And it was an enormously effective product to solve problems that were so painful

18
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:10,640
that they just could't be approached before.

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,958
Another example was a startup called Inscopix that mass produced components

20
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:17,906
to create a miniaturized florescence microscope.

21
00:01:17,906 --> 00:01:21,687
It turns out that this technical insight allowed them to

22
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:24,760
reduce the size of the device that took up the table top

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,654
to that can fit now in your hand.

24
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:29,020
And in fact they created an entirely new market

25
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,131
that solved problems that customers didn't even imagine

26
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:34,706
until they actually saw this new device.

27
00:01:34,706 --> 00:01:37,481
On the other hand there are some examples from market insight.

28
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:42,959
Zynga was one of the first companies to realize that people wanted to play games

29
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,100
online that were more involved than what is currently offered.

30
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,214
They not only wanted to play solitaire but they actually wanted to play games

31
00:01:51,214 --> 00:01:53,558
that involved interaction with other people.

32
00:01:53,558 --> 00:01:58,987
And their big insight was Facebook as the distribution channel for those games.

33
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:01,986
Twitter, another example of market insight.

34
00:02:01,986 --> 00:02:06,258
Masses of people are more likely to write a 140 characters

35
00:02:06,258 --> 00:02:08,901
than a 1000 words. Everybody was skeptical.

36
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:11,320
But it turns out that it plugged into something

37
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,324
that was both a market and a human nature insight.

38
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:15,474
It solved a need.

39
00:02:15,474 --> 00:02:18,144
Zipcar's insight was actually kind of interesting.

40
00:02:18,149 --> 00:02:21,200
Instead of just renting cars on business trips

41
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,476
it might be that people in urban areas or in college campuses no longer wanted to own cars

42
00:02:26,476 --> 00:02:29,733
but wanted to be able to get them with incredible flexibility

43
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,666
a lot more than traditional rental car companies offered.

44
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:38,216
And Zipcar actually had a market insight that made it a successful public company.
