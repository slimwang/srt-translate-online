1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,680
So, opening is a compound operation.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,080
So erosion and dilation are primitives.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,710
And it's a erosion followed
by a dilation, okay?

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,640
So that's what a opening is.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,219
And it says here, you can show
that an opening of something

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:21,310
of A by B is the union of all the
translations that fit entirely within A.

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,000
That's kind of complicated and wordy.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,250
It's much easier to see in a picture.

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,333
So here's our binary thing A, and
this is our structuring element B.

10
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,391
And the opening is all the places,

11
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:37,940
all the translations within A,
that you can fit B.

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,110
And when you do that,
you would get out this thing here.

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,080
And you'll notice that
it has broken the,

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,530
the connection between
those two triangles.

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,420
And it's also rounded the edges.

16
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,490
So, it's not surprising that it's
broken them, because it's too small and

17
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,760
the whole thing doesn't fit there.

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,650
And the rounding is because
of the shape with B.

19
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,430
It says here, and, and
you know, this is a, a slide.

20
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,319
The opening is the area that we
can paint when the brush has

21
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,270
a footprint of B,

22
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,940
and we're not allowed to let the brush
get outside of the original image A.

23
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,040
One of the other cool things is,
if you take a look at this,

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,667
if I now have this shape,
I would open with B again.

25
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:23,710
Well, it fits everywhere inside of
there, so it wouldn't change, right?

26
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,520
That is if I kept going,
it would stay the same.

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,300
And that's referred to as idempotent,
or idempotent.

28
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,820
I don't know how you pronounce it.

29
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,270
I know how to spell it.

30
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,190
It's an operation that when you
repeat it, it makes no change.

31
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:41,458
So, if you erode and
then dilate, you get something.

32
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:45,100
Well if you then erode and dilate again,
you're not going to make any changes.

33
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,020
Which is not the same as saying if you
had erode, erode, erode, and dilate,

34
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,840
dilate, dilate, that, that would
be the same as erode and dilate.

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,790
So you get that?

36
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,660
So repeated openings,
which are erode, dilate, erode,

37
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,910
dilate, that doesn't
buy you anything more.

38
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,580
But sometimes, you want to
erode either multiple times or

39
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,330
with bigger shaped things,
and then, and dilate again.

40
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,780
So let me show you an example
of using opening for

41
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,430
like that cell colony thing
we were talking about.

42
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,639
It's a different picture,
but it's the same idea.

43
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,400
So, here we have this Thomas Moeslund,
thank you very much, it, in Aalborg.

44
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,302
So here's an original image, okay,
of some cells that are growing.

45
00:02:19,302 --> 00:02:22,650
Here is a binary image, okay?

46
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:29,708
And this is the opening using
a 11 pixel disc, all right?

47
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:34,920
And you see that it pulls out,
you know, these cells pretty well.

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,980
And when you come over here,
you say okay, so it's got that one,

49
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,850
it's got that one, it's got that one,
it's got that one.

50
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,760
It's got that one, it's got that one,
it's got that one, it's got that one.

51
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,170
And you know, clearly,
maybe it misses this one, all right?

52
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,660
Maybe it misses this one.

53
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,870
So this tends to be common in
sort of these kinds of things.

54
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,610
You can find some operation which
tend to pull out what you want, but

55
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,280
it's not going to be perfect.

56
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,780
All right.
