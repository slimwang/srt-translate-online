1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,830
All right so we're still working
on the fourth task here,

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,600
which is to make sure that
the word adapter has the correct

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,130
instructions to create
each list item view.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,010
So that means first we need to modify
the word class so that the word adapter

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,140
can tell if there is a valid image
associated with the word or not.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,013
We've also provided a hint bellow
the the quiz if you need some help.

7
00:00:18,013 --> 00:00:20,830
And then we need to modify
our WordAdapter class.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,480
So it can create list items that both
contain images and ones that don't.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,160
And this way the same WordAdapter
class can be used across our

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,140
different categories.

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,670
I want to introduce you to a new concept
that I hinted at in the last quiz.

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,060
So there's a method that you can call
to change whether a view is visible or

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,240
not, while the app is running.

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,170
So for a given view object,
as shown here in the view class,

15
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:49,400
you can call the set visibility method
on it and pass in one integer input.

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,315
So the possible inputs that we have
are visible, invisible, and and gone and

17
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:57,665
these may look like string values but
let's click in and see more.

18
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:02,825
So clicking into visible we
see this actually integer

19
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:07,860
defined in the view class and
it has an integer value of zero.

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,280
Now this is how you would
use the method in your code.

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,160
Assume that we have a view stored
in the variable named text view.

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,000
We can call the set visibility
method on this text you object and

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,450
into this method we pass in one input

24
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,770
which is the integer defined in
the view class called visible.

25
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,790
Now these are the different
inputs the set visibility method.

26
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,060
Now I won't tell you the exact behavior
of these three states just yet.

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,660
I'd like you to experiment or

28
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,690
read the documentation to figure
out what they mean on your own.

29
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,270
These three visibility states are
represented by three predefined integer

30
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,830
values that the view
class knows to expect and

31
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,670
will know how to behave
if ever sees any of them.

32
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,820
So if we were to pass in a random
integer value something like 2001.

33
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,960
Then the view class wouldn't
know to do with the view.

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,330
So to summarize, the view class only
recognizes these three numbers.

35
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,410
So for example if the method
receives zero as its input,

36
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,760
the view knows that it
should become visible.

37
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,770
I want you to notice something about
the variable in the documentation.

38
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,680
So it says here public
static final int VISIBLE and

39
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,060
we haven't seen static or final before
and both of these are Java keywords that

40
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,510
have special meaning and
they're called modifiers.

41
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,030
So last time we heard about modifiers
was we talked about how words such as

42
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,940
public and private were access modifiers

43
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,620
used to control who can use
a class variable or method.

44
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,830
So because the visible variable is
declared using the final keyword

45
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,820
the field can never change values.

46
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,370
So think of zero as being
the absolute final, final value.

47
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,410
So once a variable is initialized if you
try to assign a different value there's

48
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,080
going to be a Java error
saying it's not allowed.

49
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,260
In Java when a variable doesn't
change values it's called a constant.

50
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,580
So you can think of it as
constantly being the same value.

51
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,430
When we have a constant value,

52
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,468
the convention in Java is to give the
variable a name in all capital letters.

53
00:02:59,468 --> 00:03:01,880
So, the capitalization
doesn't imply that were

54
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,965
yelling these variable names
like visible, invisible or gone.

55
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:08,755
They're just capitalized as
an easy way to help us indicate

56
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,555
that their constant values, all right.

57
00:03:10,555 --> 00:03:13,875
So the final key word, explains why
this variables are constant value and

58
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,785
has its name in all capital letters.

59
00:03:15,785 --> 00:03:17,545
Now what about the static key word?

60
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:21,110
Well, this means that this variable
is associated with the class and

61
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,110
not associated with an object
instance of the class.

62
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,530
So this is a very non-trivial concept,
but we won't go into that detail now.

63
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,120
All you need to know is that
since the variable is public and

64
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,890
static you can go ahead infer
to this variable directly.

65
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,170
Using the cost name
view followed by dot.

66
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,120
So in this case view dot visible.

67
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,280
So this dot notation
means that this variable

68
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,850
is part of the class that
comes before the dot.

69
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,030
So, other examples are view dot
invisible or view dot gone for

70
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,280
these other states.

71
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,090
After you finish modifying
the word adapter code,

72
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,380
allocating answers to
these two questions.

73
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,650
So, for this list item layout
that we're using just for

74
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,090
phrases should the visibility of
the image view be set to visible?

75
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,970
Invisible or gone and then for

76
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,240
this list item layout, which we're going
to use for all our other categories

77
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,080
should its image you be set to visible,
invisible, or gone?

78
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,269
And this is what the app should
look like when you're done.

79
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,250
So tapping into phrases
there are no images.

80
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,467
But when we tap into the other
categories, they all do have images.

81
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:30,779
