Suppose we have an analog audio signal that we'd like to digitize, or send

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:12,970
as a stream of bits. What we can do is sample the audio signal at fixed

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,280
intervals, and then represent the amplitude of

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,090
each sample with a fixed number of bits.

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,490
For example, if our dynamic range was from

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,030
0 to 15, we could quantize the amplitude

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,610
of this signal such that each sample could be represented with four bits.
