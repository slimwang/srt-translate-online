00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] So here features that you might consider when you write

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
in an advance spam filter.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For example,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
does the email come from

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
a known spamming IP or computer?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Have you emailed this person before?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In which case it is less likely to be spam.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Here's a powerful one:

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
have 1000 other people

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
recently received the same message?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Is the email header consistent?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So example if the from field says your bank

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
is the IP address really your bank?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Surprisingly is the email all caps?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Strangely many spammers believe if you write

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
things in all caps you'll pay more attention to it.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Do the inline URLs point to those pages

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
where they say they're pointing to?

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Are you addressed by your correct name?

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Now these are some features,

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sure you can think of more.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You can toss them easily into the

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
naive base model and get better classification.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
In fact model spam filters keep learning

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
as people flag emails as spam, and

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
of course spammers keep learning as well

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and trying to fool modern spam filters.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Who's going to win?

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well so far the spam filters are clearly winning.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Most of my spam I never see, but who knows

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
what's going to happen with the future?

32
00:01:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It's a really fascinating machine learning problem.
