00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,850
Let's say we have a simple page fragment with this

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,427
HTML and two CSS rules on the left that we

3
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:09,990
need to match. I've also drawn the CSS object model

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,070
on the right that corresponds to these two rules. Do you

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,800
think there's any difference in how much work the browser

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,300
would have to do to match these two rules against the

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,830
DOM? Also, while you think about that, write a sentence

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,530
or two in the box about why you picked your answer.
