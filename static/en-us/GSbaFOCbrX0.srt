1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,290
Android Wear devices operate in two
main modes, interactive, and ambient.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,310
Your watch face design should
take these modes in account.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,110
When the user moves their wrist
to glance at their watch, or

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,550
if the user touches it,
the screen goes into interactive mode.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,030
Your design can use full color,
with fluid animation,

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,140
along with a background image or
gradient in this mode.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,230
And you can press the side button
to go back into ambient mode, or

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,930
it will time out by itself.

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,420
Ambient mode helps
the device conserve power.

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,090
Your watch face design needs to include
a separate design for ambient mode.

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,040
How similar or
different it is, is up to you.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,290
Your watch face can use some color,
such as that red there,

13
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,770
on screens that support it.

14
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,840
As long as it's still obvious that
the device is in ambient mode.

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,770
In this mode, the screen is
only updated once every minute.

16
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,110
So you should not show the second hands
that we saw moving around earlier.

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,800
Your watch face will spend most
of its time in ambient mode, so

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,150
you should thoughtfully design for it.
