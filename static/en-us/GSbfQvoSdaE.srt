1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,230
And how does this tie into your work?

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,280
>> So one of the things that my colleague and I have been working on, is a whole

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,330
entire book that actually attends to the role of technology in couple and

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:14,125
family relationships. Because even though there's been a ton of research in the

5
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:18,675
field of communication in the field of of technology and cyber technologies and

6
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:24,137
digital stuff. There has been very little research in the field that looks at

7
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:29,475
relationships in the context of technology. And technology in the context of

8
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:33,606
relationships. So what we did was write a book called The Couple and Family

9
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:38,202
Technology Framework Intimate Relationships in a Digital Age. And what we did

10
00:00:38,202 --> 00:00:41,898
was we synthesized what little research there is in the field of relationships

11
00:00:41,898 --> 00:00:47,640
and technology. And then all of those other disciplines. Put it into one book.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,552
And we really try to get people to think about things like the role of

13
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:56,370
technology in your sexual relationships with each other. is being friends, on a

14
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,473
social networking site, for example, with an ex, is that okay? Is it not okay?

15
00:01:02,473 --> 00:01:08,354
is just chatting with people infidelitous? Is watching pornography a form of

16
00:01:08,354 --> 00:01:13,990
infidelity? When is the appropriate age for children to get cell phones. when

17
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,698
should they be on social networking sites? Should they be playing games? How

18
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:21,860
will that influence them? How do we make sure that our kids have access to

19
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:27,160
comprehensive sex education. That we can monitor while blocking sites that we

20
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,699
don't want them to have access to because its not age appropriate yet. So, all

21
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:36,047
of these things are things that are really emerging. Couples, families,

22
00:01:36,047 --> 00:01:39,464
individuals are experiencing them, but there's been very little written about

23
00:01:39,464 --> 00:01:44,244
it and not really a comprehensive way for people to look at it. And so our hope

24
00:01:44,244 --> 00:01:47,862
is that our book is going to be really a big step in in a beginning of of

25
00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:53,924
really this revolution of this field of couple and family technology.

26
00:01:53,924 --> 00:01:57,326
>> Now if you're interested in learning more about any of these topics, which I

27
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,674
highly suggest you do, check out Dr Markie Blumer's website or the book she

28
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:06,920
co-authored. Check out the instructor's notes section, where you'll find links

29
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,219
to information about Dr Blumer.
