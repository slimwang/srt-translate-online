1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,770
Let's look at another example.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,410
In this case, let's look at rotation.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,270
So in essence, the image moves and
is also rotated.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,610
And let's call the rotation be,
the rotation amount to be theta.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,470
Okay.

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,233
So just simplicity's sake,

7
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:20,836
let's say that we can claim c
theta is equal to cosine theta.

8
00:00:20,836 --> 00:00:26,535
And s theta is sine theta, okay?

9
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:30,930
How many degrees of freedom do we
need which would be the answer here.

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,000
How many points or correspondences do
we need between both these images and

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,510
what would this matrix
approximately look like.

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,632
I'm just giving you this coach so
you can now basically use c theta,

13
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:45,770
with sines here, here, here, here,
here, wherever they need to show up.

14
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,910
And, of course, also remember,
this would be 1.

15
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,790
And the question comes up,
how many degrees of freedom?

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:56,820
And, also more appropriately, how many
points of correspondence do we need?
