00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,390
Congratulations, you've come a long
way to make it to this point.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,470
By understanding structs and

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,570
protocols you were able to quickly
enhance the functionality and

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,260
organization of both the robot maze and
Pirate Fleet apps.

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,840
See you in the next session.
