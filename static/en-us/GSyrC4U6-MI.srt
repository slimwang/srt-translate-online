Here's the flashlight effect. It's pretty simple to code. We'll look at that in

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,190
a second. However, the effect is not very convincing, as the flashlight cannot

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,454
currently move around. This is the only addition I made to the fragment shader.

4
00:00:11,454 --> 00:00:15,870
The vViewPosition is the location of surface in view space. Actually, this is

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,440
the position negated, but for our purposes, it doesn't matter too much. Since

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,270
view space is looking down the negative z axis, and x and y are zero at the

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,500
center of the screen, the flashlight always shines at the middle. We can return

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,450
early if the surface is outside the given flashlight radius, so that only the

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,910
ambient contribution lights the object. I've added the uniform uFlashOffset, a

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,645
two element vector that gives the center point for the flashlight. There are

11
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:42,280
sliders hooked up to it, but the vector is not used in the fragment shader

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,020
itself. That's your task. If the X, Y view position in this location are close

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,030
enough together, the flashlight should illuminate the surface. Your job is to

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,690
change this code. When you're done, your slider should move the flashlight

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,800
around. Look in the original course materials for GLSL documentation links. You

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,484
can solve this problem with a one line change by using the proper GLSL built-in

17
00:01:03,484 --> 00:01:04,044
function.
