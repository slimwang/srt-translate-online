1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,860
Let's take a closer look at these two plots. Now, it

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,420
might be hard to determine which gender has more friends on

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,410
average. Remember, that's the question

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,490
we're investigating. Who has more friends,

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,110
males or females? So, instead of looking at these histograms, we

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,090
can use the table command to see if there are more

7
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,770
men versus women. When I run that command, I get this

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,450
output. So, it looks like there's slightly more males than females

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,540
in our sample. To look at the average friend count by gender,

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,390
we'll need another new command. This command is the 'by'

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,830
command. The 'by' command takes three inputs: a variable, a categorical

12
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,740
variable, or a list of indices to subset over, and

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,380
a function. In our case, we want to use the Summary

14
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,730
as the function to get basic statistics on our friend

15
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,140
count. So, friend count's the variable, gender is our categorical variable,

16
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,890
or the variable that contains our segments of users. And,

17
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,400
we want a summary of the friend count by gender. Now,

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,070
I'm not going to run this code, but I want you

19
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,800
to run it in R Studio and then answer these next questions.
