00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,760
If you walk up to typical computer today, you're

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,370
likely to find several applications open. One for listening

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,470
to music. One for playing your video game. A

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,320
web browser displaying information on some ancient culture from some

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,420
remote corner of the world. And a messaging application

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,400
for connecting with friends, and so on. How is it

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,190
possible for a single device to do all these

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,480
things, and moreover, do them all at the same time?

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,080
How can all these diverse applications, written by

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,550
different programmers who don't even know each other,

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,930
coordinate? Who's in charge here? The answer of

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,210
course is the operating system. Hello and welcome to

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,400
CS6210 Advanced Operating Systems. My name is Kishore

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,310
Ramachandran and I'll be taking you on a

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,730
journey to understand the role played by the

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,950
operating system in providing the rich user experience afforded

17
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,680
to modern applications, the modern computers. And

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,580
along the way, I'll highlight the symbiotic relationship

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,270
between hardware and software that makes it

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,379
possible for the computer and the operating system

21
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,740
to provide the rich user experience to

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,430
please you. Operating systems have evolved over time.

23
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,990
In this course we will see all the advances that have been made in the

24
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,930
operating system that has led to the

25
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,550
state of the art in operating systems today.

26
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,380
Covering a variety of platforms, from cell

27
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,460
phones to multi-core, to parallel systems, to distributive

28
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,130
computing and cloud computing. In part one

29
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,240
of this introductory lesson, my goal is to

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,990
primarily talk about the power of abstraction.

31
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,080
That will lay the foundation for the rest

32
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,240
of the introductory lesson, which will

33
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,170
include an overview of the hardware resources

34
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,260
managed by the operating system. The operating

35
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,960
system functionality that is expected, and the

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,510
abstractions in an operating system for

37
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,810
managing the hardware resources. By the end

38
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,590
of the lesson, we will be ready to discuss the structure of operating systems.
