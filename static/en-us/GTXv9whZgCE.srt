Athena is now helping out with her final project at the firm, designing a

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:09,008
concert hall. She loves music so she's very excited. But first things first,

3
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:12,604
she needs to learn a bit about how sound travels, so she can help think about

4
00:00:12,604 --> 00:00:17,576
the acoustics of the space. As a starting point, if you're listening to an

5
00:00:17,576 --> 00:00:21,224
orchestra or choir in this concert hall, would the music sound louder, sound

6
00:00:21,224 --> 00:00:24,815
softer, or sound the same, if we walked further away from the stage where the

7
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:27,900
musicians are.
