1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We need to hide that pattern, and the way to do that

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
is going to require encrypting the outputs in some way.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We have to encrypt them with different keys, though.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If we encrypted them all with the same key, then either the evaluator would be able to

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
determine all the outputs because the evaluator knows that key

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
or she couldn't determine any of them because she does not know that key.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We need to encrypt each output with different keys such that

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
when someone evaluates the truth table they can only decrypt the output

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that corresponds to the row for the actual values they have.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The question is which of these values could be used for this entry in the truth table

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to ensure that a circuit evaluator who knows a1 and b0 would be able to decrypt this output

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and none of the other outputs.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Here are the choices. Be careful that more than one of these could be correct.
