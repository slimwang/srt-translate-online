1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,249
However, the standard error changes because it's based on two sample sizes and

2
00:00:04,249 --> 00:00:09,974
two standard deviations. What is this new standard error? In problem set 10

3
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:13,817
number 10, we saw that if you subtract normally distributed data from other

4
00:00:13,817 --> 00:00:19,588
normally distributed data, we get a new data set. So, here I'm symbolizing

5
00:00:19,588 --> 00:00:24,426
normally distributed data with a mean of mhu sub one. And a standard deviation

6
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:29,751
of sigma sub one. And we're subtracting normally distributed data with mhu mu

7
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:34,076
sub two, sigma sub two. We get a new data set that has mean of just the

8
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:39,259
difference between these two means. But then the standard deviation, is the sum

9
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:45,250
of the variances, and then the square root. For samples it's roughly the same.

10
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,026
The standard deviation of this new data set, is even bigger than that for each

11
00:00:49,026 --> 00:00:55,044
individual data set. So, we know that this standard deviation of the combined

12
00:00:55,044 --> 00:01:01,238
data sets is greater than the standard deviation of just one of the samples.

13
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:05,654
because if we square both sides, we get this. And we know that this is true,

14
00:01:05,654 --> 00:01:10,479
because these are the same. And so, therefore if we add the variants of the

15
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,430
second sample on this side, then this side will be bigger than just this.

16
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,383
Similarly, the standard deviation of the combined data sets is bigger than that

17
00:01:20,383 --> 00:01:25,090
for the second sample. You can think about it intuitively, because if we have

18
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:30,670
two different distributions and then we subtract this data from the other.

19
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,033
There's going to be even more error than what exists in each individual

20
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:39,416
distribution. Like we might subtract this data value out here, from this one

21
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:46,070
here. Or we could subtract a data value down here, from a data value here. And

22
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,790
then when we combine them we have a much wider distribution, and this is the

23
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:55,134
standard deviation. Now again with independent samples, for analyzing the

24
00:01:55,134 --> 00:01:59,550
difference between those means, remember how before with the one standard T

25
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:05,584
test, our standard error was S divided by root N? Well now we're using this for

26
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:10,008
S, because it's based on two samples instead of one. So, we can replace this S

27
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:14,932
with our new one. Then we can re-write this, since both the numerator and

28
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:19,809
denominator are under the radical sign. We can say it's the same as this, and

29
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:24,933
finally we can re-write it like this. Now what happens if our tow sample sizes

30
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:30,182
are different? Then we simply have sample size one for the first treatment, and

31
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:35,698
the sample size two for the second sample. This is our new standard error for

32
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:41,139
independence samples. Before, with paired data or dependent samples, we could

33
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:47,276
simply calculate the difference between each value for each subject. And then

34
00:02:47,276 --> 00:02:52,940
we could calculate the standard deviation. Therefore, before we just had that

35
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,210
one S, but now we have two different samples and they can each be different

36
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:04,196
sizes. This also changes our degrees of freedom, but it's easy to understand

37
00:03:04,196 --> 00:03:08,876
before we just subtracted 1 from the sample size, well now we subtract one from

38
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:15,766
each sample size and then add them. Subtract 1 from n1 subtract 1 from n2 and

39
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:21,673
them, and that's the same as adding the sample sizes. And then subtracting n2

40
00:03:21,673 --> 00:03:26,209
and here's the degrees of freedom we'll use for the rest of this lesson A more

41
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:30,961
conservative approach when we're not using software is to use the smaller of n1

42
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:37,120
minus 1 and n2 minus 1. In other words, the smaller of the two degrees of

43
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,454
freedom from the two samples. But for now we'll just use n1 plus n2 minus 2,

44
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,580
because that's what you'll use later.
