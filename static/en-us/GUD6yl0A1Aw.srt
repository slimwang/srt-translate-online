1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,080
So here's the same
query you saw earlier.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,939
Now let's break it down a little bit.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,410
Like we saw before, whenever we want
to fetch data out of the database,

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,930
we'll begin our query
with the keyword select.

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,310
Then we say, which columns we
want to see in the result?

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,380
And then what tables
they're going to come from?

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,070
Then we have this where
thing at the end.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,640
That's the restriction, and it says
what kind of rows we want to see.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,410
Here, we only want to see rows
where the species is gorilla, but

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,190
what if we want to restrict
on more than one thing?

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,430
We can do that.

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,910
SQL supports the boolean and.

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,570
Just like python does.

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,620
If we want to find out the birth date of
Max the gorilla, we can do it like this.

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,390
SQL also supports the or and
not operators, also like in python.

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,490
So given what we've just seen,
how might we find the names of

17
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,930
all of the animals that are not
gorillas, and are not named Max?

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,010
Try that on the next page.
