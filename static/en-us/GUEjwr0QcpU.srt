00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,691
Now, let's go answer the same question we asked about the thread per row approach.

2
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:08,993
Let's say we have 32 adjacent threads in a warp that are each processing a separate element in the matrix.

3
00:00:08,993 --> 00:00:11,890
The rows in this matrix may be of different lengths.

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,966
Will the overall run time of these threads be proportional

5
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:18,853
to the longest row of any of any of those elements, proportional to the shortest

6
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:23,575
row of any of those elements, or completely insensitive to

7
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:26,605
the distribution of rows and elements in the matrix?
