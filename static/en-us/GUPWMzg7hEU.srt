00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,760
The specific lesson objectives for this lesson are, to introduce to

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,880
you the concept of computational photography through a specific example.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,750
The example I'm going to introduce today is that of dual photography.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,270
It's actually based on a recent work by some people up at Stanford and

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,560
are the collaborators, who basically kind of suggest that you can now swap

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,560
a camera and a light source to actually now generate a newer form of imagery.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,290
And the whole pipeline of how to do this basically impacts all the elements of

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,910
photography that we have covered so far.

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,860
And the reason for doing this introduction of this concept right now is to

10
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,900
kind of have you think about these concepts as we go

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,070
further into analysis of different methods and different technologies that

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,120
are underlying both a camera and the digital processing pipeline of images
