00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,490
In this coding task,

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,980
I want you to use an intent to send
an order summary to an email app.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,960
But first, take some time to
experiment with writing code for

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,450
different intents listed in
the Common Intents guide.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,180
See the Instructor Notes for the link.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,830
You can also do a web search for
common intents, and

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,250
it's the first link that pops up.

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,050
There's a really useful article
that you can use to find out

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,800
what's possible on Android.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,900
For practice purposes,
let's try creating a maps intent.

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,100
The documentation had some useful
information on the action and

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,740
the data URI scheme that you
should use for a maps intent.

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,440
Again, it shows geo:Latitude,Longitude.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,530
If you scroll down,
you see some example code.

15
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,680
I'm going to select this and copy it.

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,250
Now to run this code, let's just
paste it inside the Just Java app.

17
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,336
We could create a brand new application
to paste the codes so we can run it

18
00:00:47,336 --> 00:00:50,750
there, but since Just Java's already
up and running, let's just use that.

19
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,508
I'm going to highlight all this
code within this method and

20
00:00:53,508 --> 00:00:55,530
just comment it out temporarily.

21
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:02,050
I did that by hitting Cmd+/ on a Mac,
and on a windows it would be Ctrl+/.

22
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,379
Now none of this code is
going to be executed.

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,980
When the order button is clicked
I want to send a maps intent.

24
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,100
In this line of code,

25
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,850
we're creating a new Intent object
using the new keyword in Java.

26
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,543
We're calling the Intent constructor,
and passing it a ACTION_VIEW.

27
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:21,140
Note that when you see something in all
caps in Java, it means it's a constant.

28
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,680
A constant is a variable whose contents,
once set, never changes.

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,115
In this case, when composing our Intent,
we use official intent actions,

30
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:32,538
such ACTION_VIEW or

31
00:01:32,538 --> 00:01:36,950
ACTION_SEND, which are defined as
constants within the Intent class.

32
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,043
So to recap, this line of code creates
a new object instance called Intent.

33
00:01:42,043 --> 00:01:47,043
And then on the Intent object we can
call different methods like setData.

34
00:01:47,043 --> 00:01:50,191
We want to set the data URI to
be a certain set of latitude and

35
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:51,940
longitude coordinates.

36
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,570
Currently this variable is unrecognized
in our app, so I'm going to replace it.

37
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,720
This part of the code creates
a URI from this string here.

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,140
And then this URI is set as the data
field within this Intent object.

39
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,430
Now we have our maps intent created.

40
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,620
Down here, we have some code that
looks a little bit confusing.

41
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,490
There's a lot going on, but essentially
we're just preventing the app from

42
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,140
crashing by checking to see
if the Intent can be handled.

43
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,817
In terms of our ball analogy, it means
that if no one is available to catch

44
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:24,213
the ball, then the ball drops and
there's an explosion, [SOUND].

45
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:26,553
Because the system doesn't
know what to do next, and

46
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:29,340
that's why we need
this line of code here.

47
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,300
We're checking to see if there's at
least one component on the device that

48
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,840
can handle this Intent.

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,650
If so, then this condition for
the if statement is true,

50
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,960
and then we execute the line of
code here within these braces.

51
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,860
We go ahead and
start the activity with this Intent.

52
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,925
If there's no app component on
the device that can handle this Intent,

53
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:50,310
then this test condition is false.

54
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,840
And we skip this block of code and
we do not send the Intent.

55
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,000
After you've finished experimenting
with i ntents go ahead and

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,590
extend your app to have
this functionality.

57
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,043
We're going to use an intent to send
the order summary to an email app.

58
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:06,388
And then we're going to populate
the email message with this text and

59
00:03:06,388 --> 00:03:07,880
this subject line.

60
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,050
Be sure to also remove code that
displays the order summary within

61
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,260
the Just Java app.

62
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,810
Once it shows up in the email app,
we don't need to anymore in our app.

63
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,150
As a reminder,
this is what the app should look like.

64
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,520
There's no more order
summary field anymore.

65
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,830
And when I hit the Order button we
go straight into the email app.

66
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,520
Now all the user needs to do
is populate the To field and

67
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,660
then they can send the message.
