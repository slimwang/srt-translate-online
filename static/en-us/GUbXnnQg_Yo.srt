Hi everyone. This week we continued our work with functions, learning how to

2
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:08,188
find solutions of higher order polynomials. We also worked on dividing

3
00:00:08,188 --> 00:00:12,199
polynomials, specifically using long division. You can now find all the

4
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:16,373
possible real and complex zeros of a function. Let's try a few problems to

5
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:18,694
practice what we've learned.
