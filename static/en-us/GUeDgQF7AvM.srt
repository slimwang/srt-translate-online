1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,590
You've seen some
different CSS properties.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,260
And perhaps, you've even noticed
some commonalities between them.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,400
For example,
properties like width, height and

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,100
padding all expect values
that express length.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,070
And much like measurements in real life,

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,410
these properties use
units to describe length.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,810
In real life, we use units like meters,
miles, feet, and

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,050
centimeters to describe length.

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,480
But in CSS, we use units like pixels and
percentages.

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,100
CSS units, like pixels and percentages,

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,959
can be categorized into two distinct
groups, absolute and relative units.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,500
Absolute units refer to
fixed units of measurement.

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,250
Relative units refer to units that are a
comparison to another linked property.

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,500
Consider this example of a road.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,200
If i'm describing how wide
it is an absolute units,

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,520
I would say something like
the road is 7.2 meters wide.

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,670
But if I'm describing how
wide it is in relative units,

18
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,330
I might say something like
the road is two car lengths wide.

19
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,720
A car length is relative to
the average length of a car, and

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,120
can change over time.

21
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,310
So how does this look in CSS?

22
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,750
If we look at this example,

23
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,490
we have a property width being
passed the value of 400 pixels.

24
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,410
400 is our number value, and
pixels is our unit of measurement.

25
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,720
Pixels are an absolute form of
measurement that corresponds to one

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,280
physical device pixel on your display.

27
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,940
Any modern screen be it a screen
on a mobile device, tablet,

28
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,790
laptop, desktop monitor, or television
is made up of millions of pixels.

29
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,650
We can use these pixels to define
exact links that we want to

30
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,130
pass to properties.

31
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,730
But pixels aren't the only unit
of measurement used in CSS.

32
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,740
There are actually a lot more.

33
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,570
For absolute units pixels
are the most common.

34
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:51,200
However there are others like
millimeters, inches and centimeters, but

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,370
these are rarely if ever used.

36
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,362
For relative units we already
know about percentages but

37
00:01:56,362 --> 00:02:00,660
there are others like ems,
viewport width and viewport height.

38
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,120
Percentages are the most
common relative unit.

39
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,430
But you won't be using them for
a few lessons.

40
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,400
You'll use relative units more, when you
start learning about responsive design.

41
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,160
We'll stick with pixels for now.

42
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,100
