00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,110
Sometimes we only want our code to
execute if it satisfies certain

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,380
conditions.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,990
For instance, I might want to go for
a run but only if it's sunny outside.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,270
If it's raining I'd like
to go to the gym instead.

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,830
This can be done in Ruby
with someone's control flow.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,440
We can use special keywords like if,
unless, and

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,320
else to guide the logic in our programs.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,490
Let's break apart our previous example.

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,110
It's sunny outside,
can be singled out as an expression.

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,270
This expression is either true or false.

11
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:28,890
If and

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,890
only if that expression is true we want
to move forward with certain actions.

13
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,620
Let's take a deeper dive into how
we can evaluate expressions and

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,830
use control flow to make
our programs more dynamic.
