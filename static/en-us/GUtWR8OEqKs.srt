1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is 1/3, 0, 0.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I guess you can write this as 0.33.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The analogy is exactly as before.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Clearly he won't show me door number 2, because that's the one I placed by bet on.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Three he won't show me because it actually contains the car.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So he shows me 1. With absolutely certainty, he'll show me 1.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yet, this case is only 1/3 likely,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
because it's only 1/3 likely that the car is behind door number 3. Gives us 1/3.
