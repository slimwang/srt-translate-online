1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,860
So, why did our activity get
destroyed and recreated?

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,070
It's possible to create
different layouts and

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,449
resources for
different device configurations.

4
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:12,539
Everything from screen size,
to pixel density and device orientation.

5
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,179
Now keep in mind, that some of these
values, such as device orientation and

6
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:18,280
screen width, can change at runtime.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,210
So the default behavior
is to destroy and

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,519
recreate Android activities whenever
a device configuration changes.

9
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,699
Let's talk about something
else you may have noticed.

10
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:27,969
When you rotate the device or

11
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:32,518
emulator you only see onCreate, onStart
and onResume show up in the text view.

12
00:00:32,518 --> 00:00:34,710
What about onPause?

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,429
The reason is that the content of text
views that are populated dynamically,

14
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:39,020
like our log view,

15
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,440
are not automatically preserved when
the activity is destroyed and recreated.

16
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,159
To do that, we can take advantage of
the facility [INAUDIBLE] has to save and

17
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,600
restore this information.
