1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer of this specific example over here is 3,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
although you could argue it could be something else,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
but 3 is a convenient and common answer,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which is this robot's state is determined by its xy location and by its heading direction,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which is often called theta.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now, you could argue heading doesn't matter because it can turn itself on the spot,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and in some examples that is actually correct.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You might be able to get away with it with a two-dimensional state,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but if you're going to predict what's happened next when you, for example, drive forward,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the heading matters greatly.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In that sense, it's actually a three-dimensional state, so 3 is the best answer.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me ask you a few more questions about dimensionality of state spaces.
