1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,330
Now let me show you how we use
these very same algorithms

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,160
in a real application.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,530
This is a cloud-based
application called QuantDesk.

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,900
It was developed by a company I
cofounded called Lucena Research.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,090
Now, the way it works is
over on the left here,

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,840
there are various lists of
stocks that you can choose from.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,890
I've chosen Dow Jones, and
when you click on that,

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:28,068
you can see the list of stocks
that make up that group of stocks.

9
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:31,110
There are any number of ways that you
can list particular stocks you're

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,900
interested in looking at.

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,410
Now, over here are our
forecasting options, and

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,160
this is how we tell the machine
learning algorithm which

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,750
factors we want to use, how far in the
future do we want to predict, and so on.

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,060
We're using right now the default model,
and what that is is that's the list of

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:57,080
factors that we think are important for
making a future price prediction.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,310
So we can click here and
see what those factors are.

17
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,620
This is the list of factors
that we're using now.

18
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,900
So it turns out that these
factors are determined

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,220
using another machine
learning algorithm.

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,090
We use a genetic algorithm for
discovering these.

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,610
That's a subject for
a different lecture.

22
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,310
But anyhow, these are the list of
factors considered at present.

23
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,620
Now, let's do a one week forecast.

24
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,580
Let's make it a one month forecast.

25
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,270
And let's use three months of data.

26
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,800
So we're going to be looking back
three months at all these factors.

27
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,810
When we roll back time, we're able to
see the future price of these stocks.

28
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:40,930
So we can see how those factors
presumably affected the future price.

29
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,900
So let's do a forecast and
see what the result looks like.

30
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,740
So, this area here is the forecast for
Apple.

31
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,310
This is the historical price,
looking back the last three months, and

32
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,140
this is the forecast future price.

33
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,330
So that line is indicating that
we think it's going to go up,

34
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:04,860
and this arc line above and
below Is our confidence interval.

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,949
We also report that data in
a tabular format up here.

36
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:14,180
So this is the current price, this
is the forecast change in price, and

37
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,150
the forecast percentage change.

38
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:23,249
So, our system thinks that from today
Apple is going to go up about 2.5%.

39
00:02:23,249 --> 00:02:26,000
Now, we also report some
other information over here.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,490
We report what we call confidence and
back tests score.

41
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,640
Confidence refers to when we
find those k nearest neighbors,

42
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,810
how diverse are the ys that comes back?

43
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,710
So, k is the number of neighbors, and
when we look at all those neighbors,

44
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:50,540
are the closest to the values of the
quantities that Apple has today, we find

45
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,880
the 30 closest ones, and we look at the
standard deviation among all those 30.

46
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,620
If they're very close,
we're confident in our prediction.

47
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,360
If they're spread apart,
we're less confident.

48
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,210
So you can see here, American Express
is a more confident prediction, and,

49
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,820
we rate this by a number of stars, by
the way, where five stars represent our

50
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,710
most confident estimates and one star,
of course, our least confident.

51
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:20,606
So our system thinks that
American Express is going to go down by

52
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:23,530
0.9% over the next month.

53
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,800
It's got a high confidence, and
it's also got a high back test score.

54
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,650
So what's this back test score?

55
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,660
What we do is we roll back time, and

56
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:38,440
we look over all this last three
months and look forward one month.

57
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,160
And we see how accurate
all those predictions were

58
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,920
over the last three months.

59
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,030
The more accurate those were,
the higher ranking we get there.

60
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,500
So this is just an example of
how we can use these same tools

61
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,820
to make predictions in
a live real system.

62
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,960
And this is using, behind the scenes,

63
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,800
the same software that you're
learning in this class.
