1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,460
In the ADT solution, we're going to have components for lines for characters,

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,820
we're even going to treat the circular shifter, instead of being a verb,

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,960
it's going to be the circular shifts data structure and there's an operation for

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,990
computing the circular shifts.

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,600
And similarly for the alphabetized versions of things.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,580
So we try to make everything into a data structure,

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,320
the components into data structure, and

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,710
then have operations for computing the values in that data structure.

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,310
We have input components, like before, output components like before, and

10
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,600
a master controller that invokes the other components.
