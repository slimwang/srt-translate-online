1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,974
Let's start by defining 
a database contract

2
00:00:02,974 --> 00:00:05,039
between our data and our model.

3
00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:09,057
A contract is an agreement 
between our data model and our view

4
00:00:09,057 --> 00:00:11,673
describing how information is stored.

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,374
It will contain all the fields 
that our user interface will display.

6
00:00:15,374 --> 00:00:18,784
Let's go into Android Studio 
to begin coding.

7
00:00:18,843 --> 00:00:22,751
We'll add a new package 
to our project named <i>data</i>

8
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:25,353
to encapsulate the data model.

9
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:30,700
Next, we'll create a contract class 
to store our column information.

10
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:36,831
The inner classes within 
our contract class

11
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:38,415
will be used to define tables.

12
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:42,818
Each table will implement base columns
because the columns represented

13
00:00:42,818 --> 00:00:44,678
by base columns are useful.

14
00:00:44,741 --> 00:00:49,131
The ID column, in particular, 
must be part of our table in order

15
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:52,745
for our content provider integration
to work later on in this lesson.
