00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, now what if we rolled five dice and then plotted the average of the rolls?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,065
And then repeated this at least 100 times. So here, let's change it to five

3
00:00:11,065 --> 00:00:18,375
dice, and you can pick 100, or 1000, or 10,000 Anything greater than 100. Do you

4
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:24,381
think this distribution of new sample means with n equals 5 be skinnier or wider

5
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:29,770
than this distribution when n equals 2? You can take a guess or you can use the

6
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,543
applet to see what happens.
