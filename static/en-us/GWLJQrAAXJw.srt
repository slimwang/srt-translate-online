I'd like to challenge you to find an algebraic relationship between b and r.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Can you tell me what is b / r?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Is it 1 / Σ(y - y-bar)²?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Is it Σ(x - x-bar)² / Σ(y - y-bar)²?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Is it the square root of Σ(x - x-bar)² / Σ(y - y-bar)²

6
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Or perhaps is it--choose the right answer.
