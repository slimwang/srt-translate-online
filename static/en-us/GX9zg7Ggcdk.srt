00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,350
Redwoods live for millennia.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,590
The record is like 2,200 years.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,010
But it's not uncommon for
trees like that one.

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,030
Or this one that I'm sitting on, to
live for upwards of hundreds of years.

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,885
So enjoy a brief introduction to trees.

6
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:16,420
In the next part of the lesson, you'll
be doing a problem set where you'll be

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,640
applying everything that you've learned
about building websites so far.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,620
If you run into any problems,

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,110
just think back to your plan
from the first project.

10
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,934
You have all the tools, techniques and

11
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:28,208
support that you need to
push through anything.

12
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,068
In the meantime, congratulations.

13
00:00:30,068 --> 00:00:34,030
You've taken a huge first step in
your career as a web developer.

14
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,870
Okay, well maybe it's not
as big as these giants.

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,730
But still, you should be proud.

16
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,770
After you finish up the problem
set in the project after that,

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,000
you'll be learning about style and
how to add it to your website.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,500
Good luck.
