1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,370
So far, we've only considered the bivariant relationship between

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,750
price and carat weight. But there's much more to

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,140
this data set and I'd like to give it

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,840
a proper introduction. The diamonds data set ships with ggplot2

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,270
and contains the prices and the specs for more

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,090
than 50,000 diamonds collected in 2008 from diamondsc.info. Now,

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,550
analyzing this data is particularly useful. Because diamonds are

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,660
unique in a way that just isn't true of most

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,330
manufacture products that we're used to buying. You can't

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,910
just plug in the model number and just look up

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,380
the price. Though the diamonds data set is full

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,840
of prices and fairly esoteric certification ratings. Hidden in the

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,220
data are reflections of how a legendary marketing campaign

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,570
permeated and was subsumed by our culture. Hints about how

15
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,870
different social strata responded and how the diamond market

16
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,290
functions today as a result. The story starts in 1870.

17
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,800
When many tons of diamonds were discovered in South

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,960
Africa near the Orange River. Until then the diamond

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,360
market had been small, only a few pounds of

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,090
diamonds were mined each year from India and Brazil. At

21
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,280
the time, there was no use for diamonds outside

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,610
of jewelry, so price depended only on scarce supply. Hence,

23
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,460
the project's investors formed the De Beers Cartel in

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,700
1888, to try to control the global price of diamonds.

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,590
By most accounts, this has been the most

26
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,590
successful cartel in history. But World War I and

27
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,830
the Great Depression saw diamond sales plummet. In 1938,

28
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:31,600
the De Beers Cartel contacted Philadelphia ad agency N.W.

29
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,240
Ayer and Son to inquire whether, quote, The use

30
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,620
of propaganda in various forms Might help jump start

31
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,940
diamond sales in the U.S.. Which looked like the

32
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,440
only potentially viable market for diamonds at the time.

33
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,770
Surveys showed, however, that among couples contemplating marriage, diamonds

34
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,490
were low on the list of priorities. A luxury

35
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,214
for the rich, money down the drain. Frances Gerety

36
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,418
took on the DeBeers account at N.W. Ayer and

37
00:01:56,418 --> 00:01:59,600
Son. And work towards the company's goal to quote,

38
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,320
create a situation in which every couple contemplating marriage

39
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,700
feels the need to acquire a diamond engagement rings.

40
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,830
A few years later, she would coin a famous slogan.
