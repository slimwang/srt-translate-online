00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,706
When working through this problem, here's some important points to note. One,

2
00:00:02,706 --> 00:00:06,807
write down all of your work as you do it. Two, write down and label all the

3
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:10,098
values, every intermediate step. You're going to need the values throughout the

4
00:00:10,098 --> 00:00:16,166
example. And throughout, round every answer to two decimal places. Even when

5
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:19,468
you're working through a problem, if we're doing these problems for real. In

6
00:00:19,468 --> 00:00:22,775
other words, these are actual data from an actual research study. We wouldn't

7
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:26,646
round to two decimal places throughout, because that adds a rounding error. But

8
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:29,748
just for the sake of you understanding how to work these problems and interpret

9
00:00:29,748 --> 00:00:34,256
them, two decimal places is fine. Here's the start of our problem. According to

10
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:39,272
the Gallup organization, US families reported spending an average of $151 per

11
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:44,363
week on food in 2012. Now, although, this data came from a sample, we're going

12
00:00:44,363 --> 00:00:48,608
to pretend that this perfectly represents the whole population. So we're just

13
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:54,270
going to assume that this is mu. Make sure you write that down, mu equals 151.

14
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,620
Now, imagine that there's a food cooperative. We'll call them Food Now, and

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,469
they want to reduce their cost of food for their members. To do so, they

16
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,108
implement some cost-saving programs. This could include things like, buying

17
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,170
from local growers, and so on.
