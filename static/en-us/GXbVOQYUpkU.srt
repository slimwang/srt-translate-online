00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,994
Here our solutions set is negative 2 and positive 6. That's amazing work if

2
00:00:04,994 --> 00:00:09,597
you've found those two answers. First we want to square both sides of our

3
00:00:09,597 --> 00:00:14,696
equation. 2 squared equals 4, times the quantity 2x plus 4, since the square of

4
00:00:14,696 --> 00:00:20,524
this square root is simply what's inside here. On the right side, we'll square

5
00:00:20,524 --> 00:00:26,040
the binomial x plus 2 to get this expression. Next we'll distribute the 4 to

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:32,073
get 8x plus 16 on the left, and our same expression on the right. We want to

7
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:36,178
set our quadratic equal to 0, so we subtract 8x from both sides, and we

8
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:43,002
subtract 16 from both sides. This leaves us with 0 equals x squared minus 4x

9
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:48,535
minus 12. Now, we're ready to try and factor. We find factors of negative 12

10
00:00:48,535 --> 00:00:54,165
that sum to negative 4. Those factors are negative 6, and positive 2. We set

11
00:00:54,165 --> 00:00:57,850
each factor equal to 0 to get x equals 6, or x equals negative 2 as our

12
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:04,671
potential solutions to the original radical equation. Finally, we check each of

13
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:09,699
the solutions in the original equation and discover they both check. This means

14
00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:13,542
we can include both of these numbers in our answer to have our final solution

15
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:14,839
set.
