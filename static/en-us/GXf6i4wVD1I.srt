00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,692
Now, that we can receive the position of our physics object in the world, we

2
00:00:02,692 --> 00:00:05,316
have to figure out how to set the position of a physics body, which in contrast

3
00:00:05,316 --> 00:00:09,700
is a little bit trickier. Scrolling through the documentation, you'll most

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,400
likely see a nice API called set position, which will do exactly what you

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,100
think, and set the position physics body in the world, regardless of how

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,897
physics are acting upon it. Note that this type of teleportation will ignore

7
00:00:19,897 --> 00:00:23,705
any types of collision that may occur before the position is set. In other

8
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:26,495
words, set position teleports you to the desired position first, and then

9
00:00:26,495 --> 00:00:30,884
calculates the physics response. As such, you should only use set position when

10
00:00:30,884 --> 00:00:34,710
you're intentionally trying to teleport, and, when you know where you're going.

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,393
Imagine how Nightcrawler feels. So, in order to get moving with this, the first

12
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:41,016
thing we need to do, is once the physBody has been created, we can actually

13
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:45,319
call the SetLinearVelocity function, on the physBody. Setting its initial

14
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:49,354
velocity vector, so this body can be simulated and updated properly. And if you

15
00:00:49,354 --> 00:00:52,426
recall, we remove the velocity from objects each frame, in order to keep them

16
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:56,965
from sliding around our world like hockey pucks. As such, any objects that want

17
00:00:56,965 --> 00:01:00,516
continuous movement, say for instance a rocket moving at a constant speed, need

18
00:01:00,516 --> 00:01:05,740
to set the linear velocity of the physBody, each frame, to insure it's moving.

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,535
We see a perfect example of this in the simple projectile class, which will set

20
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,560
the linear velocity, before sampling from the physBody.
