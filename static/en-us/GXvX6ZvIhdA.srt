1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,260
Now that we've got the background image of our new location let's go ahead and

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,730
get some more information about the new city.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,990
For that let's start by pulling up some New York Times articles about it.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,810
The New York Times provides an article search API

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,970
that pulls articles from 1851 to today.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,420
This request will be a bit more complicated than simply creating a URL string

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,790
for an image tag.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,500
To start, we'll need an API key.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,530
Many APIs want you to use a special name called an API key

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,730
to identify yourself when you access their data.

11
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,330
There are a lot of reasons for this.

12
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,010
For instance, they might want to limit the rate of your request so

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,390
they don't get overwhelmed.

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,030
As long as you aren't issuing thousands of GET requests per day to this app,

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,390
you probably won't need to worry about a rate limit.

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,970
But all of your requests still need to have your key attached to them.

17
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,440
The New York Times uses their own API key, so you'll need to sign up for

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,610
a free account in order to complete the project.

19
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,080
Another thing you'll sometimes run into is authentication.

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,200
Services like Facebook and Twitter use OAuth to authenticate users.

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,970
They only people with accounts to be able to get data since that data is

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,260
often not publicly accessible.

23
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,200
You won't have to worry about authentication for

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,150
this course, but if you want to build more involved applications with

25
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,830
services like Facebook that's something you'll have to figure out.

26
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,740
Luckily, most services that require authentication also provide getting

27
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,970
started guides with example code and detailed explanations.

28
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,600
For now, head over to the link in the instructor notes for

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,050
requesting a New York Times API key and follow the instructions here.

30
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,490
After you got your key,

31
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,130
check this box right here to let us know you're ready to keep going.
