1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,590
If an app updates in the background, 
but no one opens it to find out,

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,560
did it really happen? 
Notification started off

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,940
as a convenient way to notify users 
of background updates.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,980
But they've grown to become 
a powerful standardized shortcut

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,540
to interact directly with apps 
in a lightweight way.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,080
Starting in Jelly Bean 
it was possible to expand notifications,

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,590
making them larger 
and containing more information.

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,500
That also introduced the concept 
of the rich notification,

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,880
which is able to include actions
like these, to be performed on the data

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,390
included within the notification. 
This speeds up interaction

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,060
and helps users streamline 
their notification triage experience.

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,890
As a standardized UI designed specifically
for conveying timely information

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,252
in limited screen space. 
Notifications were the obvious mechanism

14
00:00:42,252 --> 00:00:45,580
to use, when Android expanded 
into wearables with Android Wear.

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,150
Suddenly those rich notifications 
that you designed for phones and tablets

16
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,880
make your app wearable 
compatible, for free.

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,630
Don't overdo it though, 
there's a fine line between

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,650
useful and spammy. 
And it's only a couple of clicks

19
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,590
for a user to disable 
your app's notifications permanently.

20
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,160

in creating good notifications.
