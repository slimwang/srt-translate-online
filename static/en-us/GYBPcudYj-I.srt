1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,770
In the course, we're going to build 
a weather app called Sunshine.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,856
The main screen is a list 
of this week's forecast,

3
00:00:07,856 --> 00:00:11,502
with an emphasized presentation 
for today's weather.

4
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:14,870
With just a quick glance, I can decide if,

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:21,840
today is a stay inside and code day. 
Or if I should code from the park instead.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,256
We have icons 
to indicate conditions, like snow,

7
00:00:26,256 --> 00:00:30,790
rain, fog or sunshine. 
We can scroll through the list,

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,730
to see a long range forecast. 
With a click on one of the forecasts,

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,900
we bring up a detailed view containing 
the rest of the weathery goodness,

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,390
which also gives us the ability 
to share the weather with our friends.

11
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,760
We can go to Settings 
and change the unit of measure,

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,090
as well as the location.

13
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,360
The app can even post 
system wide notifications,

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,780
to let us know about weather conditions 
without even entering the app.

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,546
So, you might ask, 
why are we building a weather app?

16
00:01:00,546 --> 00:01:03,252
We chose the weather app 
because it's a simple concept,

17
00:01:03,252 --> 00:01:07,070
which touches most of the core APIs 
we want to teach and everyone

18
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,200
can relate to weather, 
unless you're in a bunker.

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,270
By the end of the course, 
you'll be able to use those APIs

20
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,620
and concepts to build your own app 
for your final project.
