00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,935
To understand what this metric means,

2
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:04,960
inter-selection time, let's examine some plots.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,020
Let's create a plot of the airhead inter-selection time.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,750
Each point represents the event of an airhead being selected.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,309
For example, this point represents the tenth time an airhead was chosen.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,740
The y axis value is the number of turns since the last time

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,780
someone selected an airhead.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,720
Thus higher values represents lower demand.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,460
This metric seems promising as a way to capture popularity.
