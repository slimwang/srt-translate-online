1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In likelihood weighting, we're going to be collecting samples just like before,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
but we're going to add a probabilistic weight to each sample.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now, let's say we want to compute the probability of rain

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
given that the sprinklers are on, and the grass is wet.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We start as before.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We make a choice for Cloudy, and let's say that, again,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
we choose Cloudy being positive.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now we want to make a choice for Sprinkler,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
but we're constrained to always choose Sprinkler being positive,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
so we'll make that choice.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And we know we were dealing with Cloudy being positive,

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
so we're in this row, and we're forced to make the choice of Sprinkler being positive,

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and that has a probability of only 0.1, so we'll put that 0.1 into the weight.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Next, we'll look at the Rain variable,

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and here we're not constrained in any way, so we make a choice

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
according to the probability tables with Cloudy being positive.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And let's say that we choose the more popular choice, and Rain gets the positive value.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now, we look at Wet Grass.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We're constrained to choose positive, and we know that the parents

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
are also positive, so we're dealing with this row here.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Since it's a constrained choice, we're going to add in or multiply in an additional weight,

22
00:01:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and I want you to tell me what that weight should be.
