1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,155
For this first equation, x plus 5 equals x plus 7, the right side of the

2
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:08,610
equation is always going to be 2 greater than the left side, since 7 is 2

3
00:00:08,622 --> 00:00:12,870
greater than 5. Since no value of x can make these two sides equal to each

4
00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:17,520
other, this is not an equation. There is some number that we can substitute for

5
00:00:17,532 --> 00:00:22,660
x though, in the second equation, that gives us 27 when we multiply it by 3. So,

6
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:27,871
what times 3 equals 27? 9. So, this is an equation. However, other numbers that

7
00:00:27,883 --> 00:00:32,268
we can put into x like zero would not make this true, so this has to be a

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,280
conditional equation. Our third equation is the same type as the second one.

9
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:42,244
Since some values of x make this true. And our last equation is an identity. If

10
00:00:42,256 --> 00:00:46,802
we simplify the expression that we have on the left-hand side, we can combine

11
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:51,171
like terms, since we know that x and 2x are like terms. And we can make the

12
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:55,424
left-hand side equal to 3x plus 3, which is exactly the same as the right-hand

13
00:00:55,725 --> 00:01:00,198
side. No matter what we plug in for x, these two will be equal. So this is an

14
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:00,751
identity.
