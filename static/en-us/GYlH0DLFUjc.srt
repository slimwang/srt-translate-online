Here's an example component diagram.

00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,320
The rectangles with the two sub-rectangles on their side indicate components.

This is one of Bouche's contributions to UML. He had

00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,950
The stick figures represent in this case people or actors of the system, and

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,250
the dashed line indicates where components plug into other components.
