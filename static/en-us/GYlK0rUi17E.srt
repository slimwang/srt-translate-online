1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
How can we model the spreading of a contagious disease?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The straight forward approach may be to model individual persons as either infectious or susceptible

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If one infectious and one susceptible person meet, there is a certain chance

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
that the susceptible person becomes infectious too and then the first infectious person

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
as well as the newly infected person further spread the disease.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This seems to cry out loud for a spatial model in which

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
we take care of the location of these persons that would be complex.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Luckily, there is another way. This is a much simpler way of thinking about such diseases.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The SIR Model. We do not look at the spatial distribution at all.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We simply say that our population is made up of susceptible, infectious, and recovered persons

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and we only look at the total number of these persons.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Susceptible persons can get infected and then become infectious.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The rate of that process is controlled by the number of infectious people.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The more infectious people there are, the larger the probability is

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
that a susceptible person meets an infectious person.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hopefully, people are going to recover from the disease,

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
so that is the process that takes us from infectious to recovered.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And then the standard version of that model, we assume

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
that the recovered persons are immune and cannot be infected again.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So they form a third compartment.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is a much simpler way of dealing with our problem.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We forget about the spatial distribution altogether and simply construct a mechanical model if you will

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
in which the population consists of three compartments,

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
susceptible persons, infectious persons, recovered persons

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
depending on the number of infectious persons, susceptible persons become infected

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and hence infectious and after a while, infectious persons recover and we assume that

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
recovered persons are immune against the disease and cannot be infected again.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the SIR Model. Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered.
