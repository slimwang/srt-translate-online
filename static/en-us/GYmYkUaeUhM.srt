00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,600
We just did something artistic with that
flower, so let's do something a little

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,720
bit more mathy and draw the Cantor
Gasket, also known as the Cantor Carpet.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,520
To make the Cantor Gasket,
we take a square and

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,320
then consider it as a three by
three grid of smaller squares.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,580
So there's nine squares total.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,940
Then we remove the center square,
like so.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,370
Now for the eight remaining squares,
we repeat this process,

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,600
punching out the center
of each of these squares.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,380
Well, I'm freehanding this but
you get the idea.

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,050
Starting to look pretty cool right?

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,010
Let's do it one more time.

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,760
Now we're getting some
serious fractal action.

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,244
All right, I can't draw this any further
by hand, but you should be able to write

14
00:00:41,244 --> 00:00:44,450
a program that can draw this
to a arbitrary level of depth.

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,690
This is going to be quite the challenge,
but give it a try.

16
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,540
Drawing with a recursion?

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,690
Super cool right?
