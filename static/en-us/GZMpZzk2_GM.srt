1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,090
So far we've been focusing
on defending ourselves, but

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,910
we know that the attacks
come from malicious actors.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,840
Are there ways that allow us to go
after these malicious actors and

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,290
have consequences for them?

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:20,800
Well, one way to do that is to have laws
that govern illegal online activity.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,090
In this lesson, we're going to talk
about cyber laws that address these and

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,720
some of the issues that are related
to intellectual property and

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,850
its protection.

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,960
And then we're going to talk about,

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,960
what is considered ethical behavior
when it comes to our online activities?

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,420
In the second half of the lesson,
we're going to focus on online privacy.

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,167
In particular, we're going to address,

13
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:49,834
how information about our online
activities can be captured by others?

14
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:51,950
How can they use it?

15
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,110
Who can they share it with?

16
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,960
And, what kind of options do we have
in controlling each one of these?
