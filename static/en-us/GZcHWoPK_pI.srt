00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,311
We can find the volume of the concert hall by just multiplying these three

2
00:00:03,311 --> 00:00:08,276
different lengths together, since this is a rectangular prism. So we'll have 3

3
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:12,460
x times 2 x times x plus 10. And of course it doesn't matter what order you

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,358
multiply these together in. We could leave the answer like this, or we could

5
00:00:15,358 --> 00:00:20,088
simplify. I like this form a bit better, we have V equals 6 x squared times the

6
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:23,119
quantity x plus 10. Awesome.
