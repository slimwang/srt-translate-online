00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,280
Thank you for finishing your assignments. I will

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,460
be providing feedback on the discussion forums periodically.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,142
Okay, so I now want to talk about how

4
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:10,150
Python knows about this thing called the turtle.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,970
Well, inside the Python Standard Library, there is this file called

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,620
turtle. Turtle with a lowercase t, and inside that

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,870
file is something new. And that something new is called a class.

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,840
A class Turtle with an upper case T. Now,

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,330
this is a little different than what we have

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,700
seen thus far. What we have done thus far

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,010
is some sort of file, like web browser, dot some

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,620
sort of function, like open. But we haven't seen

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,390
this thing called a class. Which begs the question, what

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,450
is a class? For now you can think of

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,040
a class as a neatly packaged box, that puts things

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,500
together really well. And it allows us to

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,850
write code like turtle.Turtle, with these strange looking

18
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,920
brackets. As if we were calling a function. In fact, when we do it on this piece

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,060
of code, we are in fact calling a

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,670
function, a function called init which is defined inside

21
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,400
the class Turtle. Init stands for initialize, and

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,130
what it does is it creates space in memory

23
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,960
for a new instance or a new object of the class Turtle. This instance we called

24
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,180
brad. Brad can now access all of the rest of the methods that are inside

25
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:33,012
class Turtle. Like forward, and right. Forward makes

26
00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:35,824
brad turn forward, and right makes brad turn

27
00:01:35,824 --> 00:01:38,240
to the right. Don't take my word for

28
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,210
it, lets look for them in the documentation.
