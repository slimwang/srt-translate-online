00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,981
Most symmetric encryption schemes are
called block ciphers because they take

2
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:07,930
a fixed length plain
text block as input.

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,430
We will discuss later how these
schemes can be used to encrypt

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,200
input text arbitrary length.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,350
Here is a very high level
view of block ciphers.

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,900
A plain text block of fixed length,
say n, is encrypted using secret key,

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,450
k, to produce a cipher attacks
block of same length, n.

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,250
The same secret key, k,

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,460
is used to decrypt the cipher attack's
block into the plain text block.
