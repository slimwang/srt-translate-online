1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,320
Go ahead and update the save profile method

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,320
in conference API to save the profile entity in

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,189
the data store. You can look for the place

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,080
marked TODO 3 in the save profile method and

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,780
that's where you add the code to save the

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,540
entity. When you've added the code, go ahead and

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,260
run your app on localhost and then go to

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,510
the API's explorer and execute the save profile method.

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,210
Use the API's explorer to try out the updated

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,240
save profile function. You'll see the responses you did

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,300
before but you'll need to go to the admin

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,730
console to check that the profile entity was saved

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,320
in the data store. And just a reminder, to

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,850
get to the admin console on localhost, you go

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,320
to localhost colon port number like localhost colon ADAT

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,570
and then you type underscore Slash ADMIN. What properties

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,820
does your profile entity show in the admin console? Check each one that applies.
