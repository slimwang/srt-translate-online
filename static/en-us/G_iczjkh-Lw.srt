1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,600
So, we can informally talk about the correctness

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,890
of the distributed mutual exclusion lock algorithm. The correctness

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,010
is based partially on some assumptions and partially on

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,480
the construction. The construction is that the Q's totally

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,670
ordered by Lamport's logical clocks and the PID to

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,620
break the ties. But that's part of the construction

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,370
of the algorithm. But it also is based on

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,200
some assumptions that we make and the assumption is,

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,700
messages between any two processes arrive in order.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,720
So messages don't crisscross each other but if I

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,780
send a message and I send another message,

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,310
the first message is going to reach the destination first,

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,080
second message is going to reach the destination second.

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,250
And that's what is meant by saying that messages

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,070
arrive in order at every node in the

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,400
distributed system. And the second assumption is that there

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,550
is no loss of messages. So every message that is sent

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,810
is definitely received, in order. So these are two fundamental assumptions

19
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:03,620
that are responsible for this algorithm being correct. Now that you

20
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,210
have seen Lamport's mutual exclusion lock algorithm, time for another quiz.
