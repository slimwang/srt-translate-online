Hi Charles, welcome to the next lesson.

2
00:00:01,697 --> 00:00:04,070
>> Hi Michael thank you for
welcoming me to the next lesson.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:04,840
What is the next lesson?

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,410
>> So I don't know, can you read it?

5
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,316
>> I can read some of it I
can't quite see all of it.

6
00:00:09,316 --> 00:00:10,540
[LAUGH] I get it.

7
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,200
>> So the other topic is
partially observable MDPs but

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,545
I made MDPs partially observable.

9
00:00:15,545 --> 00:00:16,500
>> Brilliant.

10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,380
>> Kind of fell off
the bottom of the screen.

11
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,560
So yeah so this is the idea of talking
about Markov decision processes

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,590
like we've been talking about, but
ones where the agent has to make

13
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,750
decisions based on what it can see
of the Markov decision process,

14
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,720
not necessarily the true and
current state.

15
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,470
>> You know we talked a little
bit about this in the old

16
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,630
machine learning class, didn't we?

17
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,480
But just a little.

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,570
>> Okay, all right, well so

19
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,670
then we're going to get a little bit
more into it, maybe, I don't know.

20
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,920
What did we talk about last time?

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,540
>> I don't know.

22
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,310
I don't remember,

23
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,210
just that there was-- we mentioned I
think we mentioned that they exist.

24
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:46,780
>> Okay.
So

25
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,320
we're going to talk about how they work.
