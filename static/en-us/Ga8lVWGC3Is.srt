1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,880
The conference central application includes both a back-end

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,740
application that defines the end point function and front-end

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,210
application that has the web page users functions. So

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,740
I'm going to call the back-end application, basically I'm going to

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,320
refer to it as the back-end API and the

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,800
part of the application that has the web pages

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,240
I'm going to refer to as the web UI.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,620
In our case, they're all in one single application.

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,430
Got one app ID, we deploy the app, takes the back-end API and takes web the

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,300
web UI with it. However, the web UI and the back-end API don't have to be in

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,700
the same application. They could be in completely

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,180
separate applications, or you could even have multiple applications,

13
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,045
that provide different front-end interfaces to the conference

14
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:51,926
back-end API. So here we've got several different applications,

15
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:54,219
each with a different kind of Web UI and we

16
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:58,179
have our conference API running here on the back-end API. However

17
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:01,073
in our case the web UI and the back-end API

18
00:01:01,073 --> 00:01:04,997
are in the same application. But our opinion doesn't really care

19
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:07,980
that they're in the same application. You still have to

20
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,060
authorize a front-end UI to access the back-end API. So, those

21
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,450
are a few things that you need to do before

22
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,100
you can start using the web pages in the Conference Central

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,990
application and these are all around authorizing the web UI for

24
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,180
login and giving the web UI permission to use the back-end API
