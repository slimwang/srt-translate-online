One of my undergraduate students,
Juliette, has created a nice

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,549
simulation of simulated kneeling
using rapid prototyping.

3
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:07,759
>> What does it do?

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,484
>> We put in a ball that represents our
particle, we shake the box really hard.

5
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:17,951
>> As you slowly decrease the amount of
shaking the ball falls into the deepest

6
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:19,500
well and stays there.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,280
But I have to be careful to slowly
decrease the temperature or

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,630
else it will not work.

9
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:26,189
>> You all seem to work very hard for
a few seconds of demonstration.

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,000
>> It's definitely
a theme in my research.
