00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,550
This should print 13.86, and you might use this process when splitting up a

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,350
bill for dinner with friends. In case you're not sure how I got 13.86, let's

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,450
just go through this together. There are two items, and we initially set the

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:19,406
cost to zero. So initially, cost is zero. And now for the first item, which is

5
00:00:19,406 --> 00:00:32,258
$1, we're going to say that the tax is $1 times 0.08, so 0.08. And the tip is

6
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:42,120
$1 times 0.18. And now the cost is going to be updated to be zero. Plus the

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,269
item price, plus the tax, plus the tip, which would give us about 1.26. Now,

8
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:53,910
we're going to go through for the other item, which is $10. So this time, the

9
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:01,590
tax will be 0.80. The tip will be 1.80. And the cost will be what it was before

10
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,800
plus the item price, plus the tax, plus the tip. Which if you add it all up

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,920
should give us 13.86. And if I did my math wrong, maybe that's just proof that

12
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,891
I should be having a computer do this for me.
