1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,630
We've already walked through the first
two steps in the last video.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,670
Now I'm going to show you a couple of
things you could have experimented with.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,040
I would like to change
the initial quantity value so

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,690
that when the app launches it
shows up as zero instead of two.

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,030
The way I can do that is to modify
this global quantity variable

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,400
to be initialized at zero.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,930
Then the increment and
decrement method should work just fine.

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,390
When the increment method is called,

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,570
it will use the latest quantity
value and just add one.

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,140
When the decrement method is called, it
will just decrease the quantity by one.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,250
Let's go ahead and try this out now.

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,040
That looks weird.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,490
I wanted it to show up at zero.

14
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,700
If I click the plus button,
it's weird, it goes to one,

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,850
which seems to have decreased it,
but now it starts to increase.

16
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,110
So it seems like these
buttons are working, but for

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,120
some reason the initial value was wrong.

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,350
Oh, we forgot to change
the activity main layout file.

19
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,050
In this layout we have a text
view that says the initial text

20
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,860
quantity value is two.

21
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,290
That should fix our problem with the two
showing up when the app launches.

22
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,570
Cool.
Now it shows up

23
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,660
as initial quantity of zero.

24
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,310
Then if I hit increase,
it updates properly.

25
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,340
If I hit decrease,
it also updates properly.

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,630
You can see that it's a little tricky
that we have the initial quantity

27
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,900
value in two places.

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,660
Having two places in the code
that represent the same thing

29
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,080
can be a source of bugs in the future,
like we just saw now.

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,150
An advanced way to solve this problem
is to have the main activity actually

31
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,990
display the quantity of zero
immediately when the app launches,

32
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,040
instead of relying on the layout
to have an initial value.

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,890
That way the single source of truth
would be this global variable.

34
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,260
But don't worry about that now.

35
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,280
That's more of an advanced thing
that you can do after Lesson 3.

36
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,060
The other way we can experiment with
the code is to have the plus button

37
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,510
double the number of coffees
ordered each time and

38
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,450
have the minus button half
the number of coffees each time.

39
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,360
Let's start with an initial
quantity of two, so

40
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,110
that if we hit the minus button first,
we can at least cut this in half once.

41
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,730
When the increment method is called,

42
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,110
we want to double the number
of coffees ordered.

43
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,900
We should take the current quantity and
then multiply it by two.

44
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,288
That gets updated to be
the new quantity value and

45
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,550
then we display that to the screen.

46
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,900
On the other hand,
we have the decrement method.

47
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,090
For the decrement method, we want to cut
the number of coffees ordered in half.

48
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,720
So we can take the current quantity and
then divide it by two.

49
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,470
That will be the new quantity value.

50
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,360
And we display that to the screen.

51
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,910
Let's try it out.

52
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,660
You can see how it can be a source
of error every time you want

53
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,000
to change the initial quantity value.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,250
You have to change it in both places.

55
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,105
Let's run the app now.

56
00:02:35,105 --> 00:02:36,460
Okay.

57
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,650
It starts off at an initial
quantity of two.

58
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,660
If I hit plus,
it should double the quantity each time.

59
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,070
Cool.
And it does.

60
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,350
If I hit the minus button,

61
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,820
it should cut the number of
coffees ordered in half each time.

62
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,530
And it works.

63
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,260
If I run it in the debugger, you can see
how it updates the variables each time.

64
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,358
The quantity value starts off at two,
and then it updates to four.

65
00:02:57,358 --> 00:03:01,830
And then the quantity
starts off at four, and

66
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,050
then it updates to eight and so on.

67
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,960
I'm sure you came up with much more
creative ways to play around with this

68
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,300
quantity picker.

69
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,420
Hopefully that helped you better
understand the use of global variables.

70
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,020
But if I hit the order button,
it doesn't show me the price for

71
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,200
that number of coffees ordered.

72
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,430
Let's fix that in the next video.
