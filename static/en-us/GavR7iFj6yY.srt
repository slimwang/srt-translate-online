00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,930
Research on the structure of operating systems in the mid' 90s, as exemplified

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,160
by the three research papers we studied in this course module, led to

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,100
fascinating innovations in the operating system

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,850
structure. It is important to note that

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,050
all three systems, Spen, exokernel, and the

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:25,410
LT microkernel were done contemporaneously. In this

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,340
sense, they mutually informed each other

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,840
and laid the basis for several innovations

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,860
in operating system structuring. For example,

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,800
many modern operating systems have internally adopted

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,710
a microkernel based design. Similarly, technologies

12
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,220
such as dynamic loading of device drivers

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,520
into the kernel, have come out of the thoughts that went into extensibility

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,720
of operating system services. The next lesson we're going to look at is a

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,130
logical progression of the idea of extensibility, namely virtualization.
