00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,320
We've now seen a few
improvements to the naive

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,650
version of the Ford-Fulkerson method.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,568
But this isn't the end of the story.

4
00:00:06,568 --> 00:00:10,092
There are some even more sophisticated
approaches that improve the run time

5
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:13,820
even further, also based on
the idea of augmenting flows.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,650
There's also a family of
algorithms called push relabel,

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,410
that allow the internal
vertices to absorb flow

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,750
during the intermediate
phases of the algorithm.

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,590
In practice,
these seem to perform the best.

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,679
Beyond just seeing the algorithms in
this lesson, we examined the max-flow,

11
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:29,850
min-cut theorem.

12
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,347
This was more than just a trick for

13
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:33,499
proving the correctness
of forward focusing.

14
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:37,134
It's part of a larger pattern of duality
that provides important insight in

15
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:38,760
a variety of contexts.

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,310
We'll discuss this
more in a later lesson
