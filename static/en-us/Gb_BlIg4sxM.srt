00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,080
Here's how I write to my answer. The fact that we have a

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,500
512 byte page size implies that we have 9 bits used for the offset.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,820
This leaves us with 7 bits for the virtual page number, and that

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,869
gives us 128 possible pages since two to the seventh is equal to 128.
