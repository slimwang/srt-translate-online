1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,390
Here are the errors that I found.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,180
The direction of this edge here,
should be reversed.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,100
We've exhausted all
the capacity going up.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,490
The remaining capacity on
this edge is going down.

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,155
We can unsend the two units
of flow that we sent already.

6
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:19,825
For this edge here,
there are only two remaining units of

7
00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:22,015
flow that we could possibly
send in this direction.

8
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:26,275
And there should be five
that we can unsend.

9
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:27,845
So, those two are wrong.

10
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:33,625
For this pair of vertices here, we can
indeed unsend three units of flow.

11
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:37,300
But we actually can't send any
more forward in that direction.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,660
So this edge should be eliminated.

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,680
And in this case here,
between these two vertices,

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,580
we were sending two units of flow,
so we can indeed unsend them.

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,020
But we only have one more unit
of flow that we can send.

16
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,630
So this capacity should be one.
