1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So here's my solution. I modified the code in trivial ways.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I go through all the i's as opposed to leaving out the first and last node,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and because we are cyclic, I now have to add the model of division by the length of the path

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
in this smoothing parameter.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's it. So it's a very small modification.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I don't have a graphical interface, but what the points look like is very much like an oval,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
like this, after the smoothing. It actually put all endmarks a little bit,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which is a bit of a concern, which we address in a minute.
