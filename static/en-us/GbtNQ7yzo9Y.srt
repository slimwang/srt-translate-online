1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,280
The Diagonalization argument comes up in
many contexts, and is very useful for

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,990
generating paradoxes and
mathematical contradictions.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,020
To show how general the technique is,

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,440
let's examine it in the context
of English adjectives.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,330
Here, I've created a table with English
adjectives both as the rows and

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,920
as the columns.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,400
Consider the row to be the word itself,
and

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,130
the column to be the string
representation of the word.

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,250
For each entry,
I've written a 1 if the row adjective

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,560
applies to the column
representation of the word.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,700
For instance, long is not a long word,
so I've written a 0.

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,620
Polysyllabic is a long word,
so I've written a 1.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,670
French is not a French word,
it's an English word so

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,400
I've written a 0, and so forth.

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,870
So far we haven't run into any problems.

16
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,590
Now let's make the following definition,
a heterological word

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:59,270
is a word that expresses a property that
its representation does not possess.

18
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,520
We can add the representation of the
word to the table without any problems.

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,540
It is a long, polysyllabic,
non-French word.

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,200
But when we try to add the meaning
to the table, we run into problems.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,710
Remember, a heterological word
is one that expresses a property

22
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,470
that its representation
does not possess.

23
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,960
Long is not a long word,
so it is heterological.

24
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,100
Polysyllabic is a polysyllabic word,
so it is not heterological.

25
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,420
French is not a French word,
so it is heterological.

26
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,020
In effect, we've taken the values
along this diagonal and

27
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,620
flipped them to create this row.

28
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,970
What about heterological, however?

29
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,390
If we say that this heterological,
causing us to put a 1 here,

30
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,250
then it applies to itself, so
it can't be heterological.

31
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,590
On the other hand, if we say that it is
not heterological, causing us to put a 0

32
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,490
here, then it doesn't apply to
itself and it is heterological.

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,440
So there really is no
satisfactory answer here.

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,210
Heterological is not well
defined as an adjective.

35
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,770
For English adjectives, we tend
simply to ignore the paradox, and

36
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,620
politely say that we can't
answer that question.

37
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,940
Even in mathematics, the polite response
was simply to ignore such questions

38
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,160
until around the turn
of the 20th century.

39
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,700
When philosophers began to look for
more solid logical foundations for

40
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,550
reasoning, and for
mathematics in particular.

41
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,260
Naively, one might think that a set
could be an arbitrary collection.

42
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,020
But what about the set of all sets
that do not contain themselves?

43
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,980
Is this set a member of itself or not?

44
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,710
This paradox posed by Bertrand Russell,

45
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:43,910
wasn't satisfactorily resolved until
the 1920s with the formulation

46
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:48,990
of what we now call Zermelo-Fraenkel
set theory or from mathematical logic.

47
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,360
Consider the statement,
This statement is false.

48
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,040
If this statement is true,
then it says that it's false, and

49
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,640
if the statement is false,
then it says so and should be true.

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,970
It turns out that falsehood,
in this sense,

51
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,300
isn't well-defined mathematically.

52
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,582
At this point, you've probably guessed
where this is going for this course.

53
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:12,730
We're going to apply the diagnalization
trick to turning machines.
