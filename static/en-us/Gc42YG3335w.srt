00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now let's say in the same company now with a mean salary of 70,000

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and a standard deviation of 10,000, I decide to double everyone salary,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and please don't tell my people about that--I'm contemplating with.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Don't discuss this in the forums. That's kind of secret, but what does this mean?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What do you think is the new mean and what's the new standard deviation important?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm not asking about the variance but just the square of this just the standard deviation.
