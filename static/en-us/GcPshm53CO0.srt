1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,375
So like any other
theory of intelligence,

2
00:00:02,375 --> 00:00:04,810
case-based reasoning
has some assumptions.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,540
The first assumption is that there
are patterns to the problems that

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,690
agents encounter in the world.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,400
The same kinds of problem tend
to reoccur, again and again.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,330
A lot of science is about finding
patterns that are crowded in the world.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,090
Physics finds patterns that
are crowded in the world that

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,550
are expressed by various kinds of laws,
like Newton's second law of motion.

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,950
Presumably, if you're going to build
a theory of intelligence, that theory

10
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,479
too will give an account of what kind of
patterns exist in the world that mind,

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,300
that intelligence, must encounter.

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,060
And case-based reasoning says,
one of the common patterns is

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,660
that the same kinds of problems
occur again, and again, and again.

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,850
So that's the first assumption.

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,580
The second assumption is that similar
problems often have similar solutions.

16
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,700
Here is a grid of a part of Long Island.

17
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,520
Here is a grid of part of Dallas, Texas.

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,550
Now if you look at the one in
Long Island, you can see that

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,780
if there are two problems which
are very close to each other,

20
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,570
they're likely to have
very similar solutions.

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,480
And the same is true for
the grid in Dallas.

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,920
Similarly, the second
assumption is not always valid.

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,750
Here is an example of it.

24
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,940
I'm sure all of you know
how to tie your shoelaces.

25
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,000
But imagine that you buy
a new pair of shoes, and

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,650
this new pair of shoes
have velcro straps.

27
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,120
Now the problem's very similar,
how to tighten your shoes, but

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,290
the solution is radically different.

29
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,950
>> So Ashoke, another example of
this that comes to mind, for me,

30
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,220
is the example of touch screens.

31
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,260
Some of the early touch screens could
only handle one touch at a time.

32
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,410
If you touched it with two fingers at
a time, it either wouldn't register, or

33
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,590
it'd only register one of the touches.

34
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,360
Current touchscreens, on smartphones and

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,840
tablets that we use today, can handle
two or three or four fingers at a time.

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,470
The problem is very similar.

37
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,570
We're still touching the screen and
interacting with it with our fingers,

38
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,650
but the solution is actually very,
very different.

39
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,650
It uses a completely different kind
of technology, different material for

40
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,430
the screen, and

41
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,130
a different way of detecting where
the screen is being touched.

42
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,720
>> That's a good example, David.

43
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,490
So we have at least two examples
now where similar problems can have

44
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,510
quite different solutions.

45
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,510
Nevertheless, this assumption
is valid most of the time.

46
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,310
Most of the time,
two problems that are quite similar

47
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,930
will end up having two solutions
that are quite similar, as well.
