1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,719
The summer of 2001 essentially saw a

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:07,300
new era in internet security with three major

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,300
worm outbreaks. These three major worms were

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,560
Code Red One, version two, Code Red Two,

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,200
and Nimda. Let's take a quick look at each of these worms. Code Red 1

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,600
was released on July 13th, 2001, and was

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,170
the first modern worm. It exploited a buffer

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,770
overflow in Microsoft's IIS server. From the

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,040
1st through the 20th of each month, it

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,350
would spread By finding new targets using a random scan of IP address space, it

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,510
would spawn 99 new threads, which generated

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,960
IP addresses at random and then looked for

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,670
vulnerable instances of IIS. Now version 2

14
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,450
Of code red one, was actually released six

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,290
days later and fixed that random scanning bug.

16
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,640
So that each instance of the worm scanned

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,960
a different part of IP address space. After

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,620
the scanning bug was fixed, the worm was able

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,550
to compromise 350000 vulnerable hosts in a matter of only

20
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:11,590
14 hours. By most estimates, that was the complete set of hosts

21
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,650
running the vulnerable version of IAS. On the entire internet. The payload

22
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,630
of this worm was to mount a denial of

23
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,900
service attack on whitehouse.gov. But a bug in the

24
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,780
coding, caused the worm to die, on the 20th

25
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,500
of each month. If the victims clock was wrong however,

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,220
the worm would actually resurrect itself. On the 1st.

27
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,330
Fortunately in this case, the payload which launched the

28
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,170
denial of service attack on whitehouse.gov actually was launched

29
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,000
at a particular IP address, not at the domain name.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,400
So the operators of the website needed only

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,670
to move the web server to another IP address

32
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,040
to defend against the denial of service attack.

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,270
A better worm design would have been much more

34
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,320
catastrophic. Code Red 2 exploited the same vulnerability

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,420
but had a completely different payload, it was released

36
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,980
on August 4th, 2001, and was called Code

37
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,990
Red2 mainly because of a comment in the code.

38
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,870
The worm actually only spread on Windows

39
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,990
2000, it actually crashed on Windows NT.

40
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,810
The scan actually preferred nearby addresses It

41
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,520
would choose addresses from the same /8

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,085
with probability one half from the same

43
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:26,910
/16 with probability three eighths, and randomly

44
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,630
from the entire internet with the remaining

45
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,460
one eighth probability. The reason for preferring nearby

46
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:38,620
IP addresses is that if there was one vulnerable host on the network. There was

47
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,260
likely to be more, because the same

48
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,580
administrator that failed to patch the compromised machine

49
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,480
might have other machines on the same

50
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,050
network that were also vulnerable. This notion of

51
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,830
preferential scanning can speed up infections in some

52
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,880
cases by increasing the probability that scanning will

53
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,910
find another vulnerable host. The payload of this worm was an IIS

54
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:09,300
backdoor, and the worm was completely dead, by design, by October 1,

55
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,250
2001. Nimda released on September 18, 2001

56
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,450
and was interesting mostly because it spread using

57
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,390
multiple propagation vectors. It was effectively multi-model. So in addition

58
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:30,310
to using the same IIS vulnerability as Code Red 1 and Code Red 2, there were

59
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,410
some additional vectors that it used. It could

60
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,460
spread by bulk email as an attachment. It copied

61
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,460
itself across open network shares. It installed an

62
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,620
exploit code on webpages on the corresponding web

63
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,000
server running on the machine, so that any

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,270
browser that visited the webpage for that server would

65
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:55,670
become infected itself and it would scan for the Code Red 2 backdoors that

66
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,350
that worm had installed. The interesting thing

67
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,980
about the multi-modal nature of the Nimda worm

68
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,570
is that signature based defences don't necessarily

69
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,150
help, because of the many ways that it

70
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,830
could spread, for example, by email or

71
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,580
via a website exploit, Nimda actually needs firewalls.

72
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,560
Most of the firewalls pass the email carrying

73
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,050
Nimda completely untouched, using brand new infection with

74
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,300
an unknown signature, and those scanners couldn't detect

75
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,250
it. This was the first instance of a worm

76
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,450
that exploited what we would call a zero

77
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,720
day attack which is when a worm first appears

78
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,360
in the wild. And the signature of the

79
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,800
worm is not extracted until minutes, or hours later.

80
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,720
Zero day attacks are particularly viralent because the

81
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,650
worm can spread extremely quickly, before any type

82
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,670
of signature-based antivirus has a chance to catch

83
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,870
up and prevent the infections in the first place.
