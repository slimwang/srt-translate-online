1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,010
Notice that the apparent similarity between rose and gold is achieved at

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:09,020
the very moment of lookup and not as a result of some earlier copying process.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,150
For properties that can be found directly on the lower object,

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,190
the prototype chain is never consulted.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,280
Since the key b can be found directly within rose,

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,640
this isn't considered a field lookup.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,930
And so, the prototype relationship just doesn't come into play in this case.

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,190
As usual, completely absent properties are reported as missing.

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,020
What do you think will be logged in this situation?
