1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,710
Well actually fail-safe
says you should deny it.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,370
If access is not provided explicitly,
then the default is deny.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,090
So the only way for

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,380
someone to gain access to a resource
is that it is guaranteed to them.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,830
If we're silent about
access being granted,

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,670
then basically we assume it should
not be, so the default is deny.

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,380
And the first option is the right one.
