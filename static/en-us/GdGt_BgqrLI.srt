1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,054
Right, so, I was clicking around. I clicked here. It

2
00:00:03,054 --> 00:00:05,810
seems like I can access a bunch of my objects.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:06,440
>> Yup.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:06,939
>>

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,690
clicked here, and this was interesting. So, what's going on with these guys?

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,220
>> Yeah, so, remember earlier when we overrode the global action layout

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,450
to be able to put in our create a set time action?

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,030
>> Yeah.

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,310
>> This is the global layout that you'll see from anywhere

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,570
inside this mobile app, if you haven't overrode the global layout.

11
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:25,940
>> Okay.

12
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,480
>> So you can create a Chatter post, create a new contact, maybe create

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,520
a task. All of these things are

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,800
actions that are quickly available to mobile users

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,250
to do from anywhere in the app.

16
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,570
>> Okay. So presumably that means. The the

17
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,930
action I made, the make a new set time.

18
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:41,270
>> Yep.

19
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,290
>> I can do that from my phone.

20
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,850
>> Yeah. Super easy.

21
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,710
>> So how would I do that?

22
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:50,100
>> Okay, so close the global actions. And if you scroll down. You can

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,250
see that we can click straight into

24
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,730
that Udacity Stage record. Like we saw earlier.

25
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:53,970
>> Mm-hm.

26
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,360
>> But instead of going that direction. Let's just use the

27
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,110
mobile navigation by clicking that little icon in the corner, yep.

28
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,860
>> Mm-hm.

29
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,780
>> And then scroll up.

30
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,530
>> Oh.

31
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,265
>> To the Show More. Click that guy, and just go to

32
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:07,883
the Stage tab, and we'll go straight to the record this way.

33
00:01:07,883 --> 00:01:09,139
>> Okay, the Udacity Stage?

34
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:11,702
>> Yep.

35
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:14,788
>> Now, plus has at a set time.

36
00:01:14,788 --> 00:01:15,121
>> Yeah.

37
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:19,020
>> It's pretty cool. Okay, so if I hit add a set time,

38
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,090
as I expect, has all these fields. So say it's just December 1st.

39
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:24,930
>> Sounds good.

40
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,613
>> status is new. Oh, cool, it has the automatic thing.

41
00:01:29,613 --> 00:01:30,250
>> Yep.

42
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:30,750
>> Nice.

43
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,770
Time. I really like how it automates the pick list.

44
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,650
>> It just knows.

45
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,040
>>

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,500
>> Set the Udacity stage, and let's pick a band.

47
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,570
>> Yeah, let's go with U3 in.

48
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:53,590
>> Alright, so what we're looking at right now is the Udacity stage, you

49
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,570
know mobile page layout. It shows us all the fields that we saw in the computer.

50
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:56,954
>> Mm-hm.

51
00:01:56,954 --> 00:01:57,275
>> Right?

52
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:57,684
>> Mm-hm.

53
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:57,860
>> But,

54
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,180
we can scroll left and right. And see different things on

55
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,550
this. So in this case, on this first window we can see

56
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,620
the Chatter feed. And so this is the set time we just

57
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,949
created, and here's the set time we created in the app earlier.

58
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,761
>> Mm-hm.

59
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:14,320
>> Now if we scroll to the right, we can see

60
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,950
the related lists of all the things related to this Udacity Stage.

61
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:17,980
>> Uh-huh.

62
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,460
>> So like the set times we just created.

63
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,640
>> Makes sense. Cool.
