00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,405
Okay.

2
00:00:00,407 --> 00:00:05,236
For this third problem, I have the negative of the absolute value of 3 cubed, or

3
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:10,428
3 to the 3rd, minus the quantity 4 times 6 minus 5 squared. And this quantity is

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,426
cubed or raised to the 3rd power. Remember, start with the inside parenthesis

5
00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:20,016
first, and then work your way out. You can put your answer in this box here.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good luck.
