00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,120
I'd like to take
a moment to defend Andy.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,074
>> Thank you Ben.

3
00:00:04,074 --> 00:00:05,150
>> Sure.

00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,960
In his defense it's really easy to
justify storing your model in your view

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,220
because it's so easy to do.

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,710
For version one of Cat Clicker he
didn't set up anything special

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,110
to store his data.

8
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,130
He just asked for the data out of the
view, updated it and put it right back.

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:20,870
But as we can see,

10
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,520
that did not scale very well when
his project got much bigger.

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,210
The biggest issue with Andy's code is
that he stored his data in the dom.

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,020
Or, more generally, he didn't separate
his view and his model within octopus.

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,290
In fact in his code, the model and
the view were the exact same thing.

14
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,130
And that's what got him into so
much trouble.
