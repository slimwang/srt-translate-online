00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,548
>> The answer is that the graph would become a straight line if the coefficient

2
00:00:04,548 --> 00:00:09,277
a equaled zero. If we substitute zero in the place of a, then this entire first

3
00:00:09,277 --> 00:00:14,073
term becomes zero since zero times anything is zero. Then we would just be left

4
00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:18,754
with y equals Bx plus c. We can recognize this as the slope intercept form. Of

5
00:00:18,754 --> 00:00:23,952
the equation of the line. Where B here is serving as the slope, and C is serving

6
00:00:23,952 --> 00:00:26,557
as the Y coordinate of the Y intercept.
