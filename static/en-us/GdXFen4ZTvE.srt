1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,880
Honeypots is another component of
the intrusion detection technologies.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,320
Honeypots are decoy systems

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,120
to attract the attackers away
from the critical systems.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,390
By diverting attackers from valuable
systems to honeypots, we can observe

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,060
what the attackers are trying to
do to our systems and networks.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,800
And based on that information,

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,750
we can develop strategies
to respond to the attacks.

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,720
Typically a honeypot system is
filled with fabricated information

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,790
to make it appear to be
a valuable system on the network.

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,570
A honeypot system is instrumented
with monitors and event loggers so

11
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,750
that any access, or any activity
on the honeypot system is logged.

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,730
In order to attract attackers to
a honeypot and keep them there, so

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,810
that we can gather more
information about attacks.

14
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:57,030
Any attack against a honeypot
is made to seem successful.

15
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,760
Most importantly, a honeypot is not
a real system used by any real user.

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,950
Therefore any access to
honeypot is not legitimate.

17
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,080
Most likely, any inbound connection
to honeypot is a network scan or

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,700
direct attack.

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,400
In addition,
any outbound traffic from the honey pot

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,170
means that they system is
most likely compromised.
