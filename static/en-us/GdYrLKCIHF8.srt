1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,270
Here you can see where I've created my
PendingIntent called mSignInIntent.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,870
It's just an activity level variable.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,290
And ditto for the int mSignInError.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,000
We'll be accessing these
in the onConnectionFailed.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,040
And here you can see
my onConnectionFailed.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,590
I have a connection result
called result coming in with it.

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,130
I'm just going to log
what's been going on.

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,520
And then I'm going to
check the mSignInProgress.

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,530
If it is not state in progress,
then we want to

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,430
get the resolution from the result and
load that into the SignInIntent.

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,910
And the error code from the result
will be loaded into the sign in error.

12
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,820
We can use these to log and
track what's going on.

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,900
If the sign in progress is
actually state sign in,

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,520
it shows that the user already
clicked on the button.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,910
And we should continue
processing errors.

16
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,660
There can be a number of errors that get
fired when it's trying to sign in, so

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,970
we should just call resolveSignInError.

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,310
Finally, if we fall out of this
If clause and we're down to here,

19
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,560
then we're actually signed out, so
we should just call onSignedOut.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,730
We'll implement that shortly.
