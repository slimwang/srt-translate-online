1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,990
Since we now know that in order to bake
lights for an object, it must be static

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,410
in the scene, we should figure out how
to tell Unity an object doesn't move.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,285
So to do that, we first click
on the object in the hierarchy.

4
00:00:11,285 --> 00:00:15,010
In this case I'm going to be
clicking on the GL game object.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,660
Now if you look at the top right of the
inspector, you'll see a static checkbox.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,052
This is the property that Unity uses to
tell whether an object is static or not.

7
00:00:24,052 --> 00:00:26,710
You'll see that it's currently
unchecked, so let's enable it.

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,630
Once we do that,

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,720
Unity prompts us if we want to
apply this setting to all children.

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,350
Since that would be our whole room, and

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,690
we know that it's all static,
let's click Yes.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,230
Now we've defined our whole
apartment to be static, and

13
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,240
we've actually enabled it that to be
static not only for lighting, but

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,840
also for
a bunch of different properties.

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,910
If we click the down arrow next to
the Static button, we'll see that

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,140
we can choose for which properties
we want this object to be static.

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,750
There can be cases when we want
an object to be static for,

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,650
say, lighting, but not for navigation.

19
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,670
You'll usually tackle these
on a case by case basis.

20
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,489
But in general, if you know an object is
never going to move, like our apartment,

21
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:10,490
then we should mark it static for
everything.

22
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,490
Now let's move on to
the lighting aspect.

23
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,630
In case you didn't notice,

24
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,070
we've actually already added in
several area lights to the scene.

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,160
So we just need to bake them now.

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,724
To do that, we go to Window &gt; Lighting.

27
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:29,657
Let's dock that next to the inspector
and then click Build to bake our lights.

28
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:34,280
Give it some time since this is bit
more complicated of a calculation.

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,508
To remove this red tint,
let's disable our point light, and

30
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:42,320
there we go,
we have a super nicely lit room.

31
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,130
Now, you may be wondering what
the sliding window is, and

32
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,400
we'll be exploring that next.
