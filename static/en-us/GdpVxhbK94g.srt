00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,750
One of the most interest things about using real data and then trying to fit

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,320
equations to it, is that it doesn't usually fit a single function perfectly. We

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,266
can find curves that approximate it, but it's probably not going to be a

4
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:17,350
completely 100 percent perfect fit. So let's see how that fit changes,

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,340
depending on which points here we decide to base our function off of. Here, for

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,540
example is the graph that we would get if we used the first two points on our

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,690
chart to create and exponential graph. So what would this graph predict the

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:36,860
population to be in the year 2013? Considering the scale on our graph here, it

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,940
probably seems like it's pretty tricky to predict that. But luckily, Desmos is

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,810
here to help. You'll find a link to this exact graph in the instructor comments

11
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,200
on this question. Click on the link and then this graph will popup. Once it

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,970
does, you can take a mouse and touch a point on the curve. From there, you can

13
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:02,000
drag it, and select what x value you want. And from there, you can see what y

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,260
value corresponds to it. Remember that this graph measures the year on the

15
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,870
x-axis, and it shows the world population in billions of people on the y-axis.

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,860
Now once you figured out what this graph says, the population will be in 2013,

17
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,440
can you tell me if this is an accurate prediction? Think about what the

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,200
population actually became by of year 2013, and see if this is the same thing.

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,199
If you want to, you can also use Google to search for world population in 2013.
