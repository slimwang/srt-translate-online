1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,530
Our next important
concept is the matching.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,670
Given a graph,

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,670
a subset of the edges is a matching
if no two edges share a vertex.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,670
Note that the graph doesn't
have to be bipartite.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,120
Take for example, this graph here.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,770
These two edges here
constitute a matching.

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,950
By the way, we'll refer to an edge
in a matching as a matched edge so

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,140
these two edges are matched.

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,280
And we'll refer to a vertex in
a matched edge as a matched vertex.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,330
So these four vertices
here are matched vertices.

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,840
A maximum matching or

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,610
max matching, for short is
a matching of maximum cardinality.

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,880
Note that a maximal matching
is not a maximum matching.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,130
For instance,
this matching here is maximal

15
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,220
because I can't add any more edges and
still have it be a matching.

16
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,000
On the other hand,

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,560
it's not maximum because there's
a matching of greater cardinality.

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,870
For instance, this one here.

19
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,410
This happens in bipartite graphs too.

20
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,340
Here is a maximal matching but

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,900
it's not maximum because
there is a greater matching.
