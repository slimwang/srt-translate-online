1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The key observation is that this thing over here is n!/(n-k)!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and to see this let's go back to the case where we had 4 heads.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the 4 heads case, we multiplied all the way to times 5 over here.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We only multiplied all the way to 7. These are the 4 heads that we placed.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So n! goes from 10 all the way to 1. (n-k)! goes from 10-4 and that's 6 all the way to 1.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So this blue expression over here will go from 10 x 9 x 8 and so on all the way to 1

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
over now n-k, 10-4 is 6. 6<i>5</i>4 and so on.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
When you look at this, the 6<i>5</i>4 occurs on top as well.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So we can cut those out and what remains is 10<i>9</i>8*7. This one over here.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Now once we place these 4 heads, we have to divide by a 4 factorial

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
which is different ways of placing those 4 points into the predefined bins.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So put differently, this is k! so if we put all this together you get n!/(n-k)!*k!

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This is the expression over here. Let's practice this one last time.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Say you have 125 coins and you ask how many ways exists in which 3 coins come up heads.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What is the resulting outcome? Be careful when you use your calculator.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It might result in an overflow, but the answer is easy to compute.
