00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,359
Here's a diagram of the state space for
the vacuum world.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,480
Note that there are eight states and we
have the actions connecting the states.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,950
Just as we did in the Romania problem.

4
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:13,809
Now, let's look at a path
through this state.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:19,329
Let's say we start out in this
position and then we apply the action

6
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:23,539
of moving right, then we end up in
a position where the state of the world

7
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:28,460
looks the same, except the robot has
moved from position A to position B.

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,929
Now, if we apply the action,
turn on the sucking action,

9
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:36,259
then we end up in a state where
the robot is in the same position,

10
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:39,659
but that position is no longer dirty.

11
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:42,139
Let's take this very
simple vacuum world, and

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,520
make a slightly more complicated one.

13
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:47,679
First, we'll say that
the robot has a power switch.

14
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:54,820
Which can be in one of three conditions,
on, off, or sleep.

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,409
Next, we'll say that the robot
has a dirt sensing camera, and

16
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:00,759
that camera can either be on or off.

17
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:04,969
Third, this is the deluxe model of
robot, in which the brushes that clean

18
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:09,980
up the dust can be set at one of five
different heights to be appropriate for

19
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,640
whatever level of carpeting you have.

20
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,170
And finally,
rather then just having the 2 positions,

21
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,640
we'll extend that out and
have 10 positions.

22
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,518
And now the question is,
how many states in this state space?

23
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:35,519
