1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,990
Once you publish your app
to a distribution platform,

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,060
the first thing that people will
notice is your game icon and name.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,700
Let's focus on the name first.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,310
Choosing your name strategically affects
where your game appears in search

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,610
results, and can help you stand
out from your competitors.

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,250
Here are a few tips to consider
when you're thinking of a name.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,750
Keep it short and simple.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,020
Make it descriptive and make it unique,
which will make it easy to search for.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,930
Each app store has a maximum app
namel length, before it cuts off and

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,590
turns into ellipses.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,490
As you can see in this example,
Angry Birds Star Wars, and

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,840
Kingdom Rush Frontier are cut off.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,030
So make sure to keep your name
short enough to make it visible,

14
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,560
especially the parts of
the names that are descriptive.

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,440
Having a descriptive name is
really important because then,

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,320
when someone browse the app store,

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,795
they'll have an idea of what your game
is about, right when they see it.

18
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:53,630
Here the name, Stack the States and

19
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,850
Table Top Racing give us an idea of
what to expect in the game, even if

20
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,290
we've never heard of them before,
a stacking game and a racing game.

21
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,870
You also want to have
a searchable game name.

22
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,840
One that sets itself apart
from any similar apps.

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,760
If you don't, you might end
up with too much competition.

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,680
Like in the case of names that
involve flappy in their title.

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,730
After the success of Flappy Bird, so

26
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,380
many other flappy apps popped up that
it was hard to tell one from the other.

27
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,390
So choose a unique, descriptive,
and short game name.
