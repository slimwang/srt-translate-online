1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,150
In this demo, you'll use accelerometer
readings to create a bubble level,

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,870
like the kind you'd use in carpentry
to make sure that a board is flat.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,400
This exercise is very similar to
the previous demo, where we drew lines

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,600
representing the magnitude of
the acceleration in the various axis.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,970
In this case, however, we'll combine
those magnitudes in a single vector and

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,750
we'll draw a bubble there.

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,740
First, we'll draw a circle centered
in the middle of the world

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,710
with a radius equal to
a quarter of the world's size.

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,190
We want to scale the movement of
the bubble such that when the phone is

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,540
vertical, the bubble will
just be resting on this line.

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,750
So obviously you can't see it
when the phone is vertical,

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,680
but as I tilt the phone, the bubble
will be approaching that red line.

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,130
Then we'll just draw a little
green bubble right in the middle

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,070
that just barely holds the bubble
when the phone is level.

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,192
All right, give the bubble level a try.

16
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:51,934
This is another tough one.

17
00:00:51,934 --> 00:00:55,490
So feel free to refer back to
the previous demo or the solution code.
