00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:07,060
Until now, what we have seen in this lecture is a quick review of the concepts

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:13,060
that you are most likely already familiar with. The next lesson will launch into

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,290
the evolution of the operating system's structure.

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,700
Before we get into that lesson, if you

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,310
feel you could benefit from reviewing the basic

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,180
concepts of an operating system. I strongly recommend

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,680
that you review the basic subsystems of an operating system. CPU

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:36,040
scheduling, memory management and the network protocol stack. To help you

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:42,250
navigate this background material, my tall friend here, Charlie Brubaker has

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,660
produced lecture materials that are available as part of this course offering.
