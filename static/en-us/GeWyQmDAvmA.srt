1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,170
Before we show you, a computationally more feasible way

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,490
of proving theorems in logic, or proving the truth value of sentence in logic.

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,630
We should point out that so far, we have been using only propositional logic.

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,750
Propositional logic is sometimes also called the zero-if order logic.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,310
The key aspect of propulsion logic, is that it does not have any variables. So

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,160
as an example, I may have a sentence that says if the animal Lays-eggs,

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,770
and the animal Flies, then the animal is a Bird.

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,950
And here I'm talking about a specific animal. Well, sometimes I might want to

9
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:41,100
talk about, animals in general, any animal, all animals. In that case,

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,100
I would want to introduce a variables in it. So in first audilogic,

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,910
otherwise known as predicate calculus, I might want to say something like.

12
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:55,060
If x Lays-eggs and x Flies, then x is a Bird.

13
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,850
Which has a set form very similar to form here, except that instead of animal,

14
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,050
I now have a variable. Now, I have a variable here. But, I must also

15
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,000
specify the range of the variable. And what I really want to say here is for

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,680
all animals. Therefore I'll introduce a new quantifier over the variable x.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,250
This quantifier is called Universal Quantifier. It is denoted with the symbol,

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:23,288
this is the symbol for Universal Quantifier. And this says now for all x,

19
00:01:23,288 --> 00:01:28,050
if x Lays-eggs, and x Flies it implies that x is a Bird.

20
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:33,650
One thing to note here is that, I could have rewritten this sentence,

21
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,460
with the Universal Quantifier back into proposition logic. But,

22
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,978
having lots of sentences like this. In proposition logic. So I could've said

23
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:46,758
Lays-eggs (animal) one, Flies (animal) one implies Bird (animal) one,

24
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:51,930
Lays-eggs (animal) two, and Flies (animal) two implies Bird (animal) two.

25
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,310
And so on and so forth, for each and every animal that is possible.

26
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,820
But, by writing it in the form of a variable, a Universal Quantifier statement,

27
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,290
I can reduce the number of sentences I have to write into just one sentence. So

28
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,130
we have introduced variables, and we have talked at least about

29
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,170
one quantifier so far, the Universal Quantifier, that applies for

30
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:17,800
all values that that variable can take. Sometimes I might want to specify

31
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,670
a different range of the variable. Not all values of the variable can take, but,

32
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,210
at least some values of the variable I can take. So consider again,

33
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,860
this sentence, here the animal is [UNKNOWN] a specific animal. Now let's look at

34
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,950
the second sentence on this screen. And this sentence is the variable y.

35
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:43,420
It says if y Lays-eggs and y Flies then it implies that y is a Bird.

36
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,265
This sentence is a very similar form, to the previous except for

37
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:52,240
the variable y. I can specify the value, that the variable y can take.

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,730
This time I want to specify not that this sentence is true for all values of y,

39
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,650
for all animals, but simply that it is true for. Some at least one animal

40
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,950
in which case I'll use an Existential Quantifier. Here is the symbol for

41
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,810
an Existential Quantifier, this Existential Quantifier says that there is at

42
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,890
least one animal, for which this sentence happens to be true.
