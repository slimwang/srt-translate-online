1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,120
The focus of this lesson is
going to be on software security.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,070
Software runs on everything.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,650
The devices we carry in our pockets.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,425
The back end servers.

5
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:14,500
Even the network elements that provide
the connectivity that we depend on.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,450
We're going to explore common bugs and

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,740
vulnerabilities and
how they get exploited.

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,710
We're also going to talk about defenses,
both what we can do, and

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,320
what the operating system can do for us.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,180
By the end of this lesson, hopefully,
you're going to understand

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,340
the importance of what we
call secure programming, and

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,340
will practice it when you write code.
