00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,372
The final thing that I wanted to mention in this overview of

2
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:10,720
software architecture, is evaluation. It doesn't do you that much good

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,630
to develop this fancy architecture, if it's not the right one. Okay? So,

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,550
we need some process by which we can judge the correctness, completeness,

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,730
consistency. And other quality aspects of the architecture we've produced.

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,998
Because of its, the importance of software architecture on the ultimate

7
00:00:28,998 --> 00:00:34,160
product being developed, it's key to get it right.

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,020
Because if we make a mistake, it's very costly to make a change. So,

9
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:44,030
some approaches have been developed for dealing with architectural evaluation.

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,860
One of those, is architecture review boards. That is, for large systems which

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:54,000
are developed by multiple teams. Or, maybe systems of systems. Making a change

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,520
can have impacts on various unexpected places in, in the ultimate system. And

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,780
so it's good to have the stakeholders, particularly development stakeholders,

14
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,600
sit down and evaluate the impact of those changes. Some organizations have,

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,910
formalized this into a periodic meetings. That review suggested for

16
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,010
architecture, suggestions for architectural changes. Also some, so,

17
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:25,210
some evaluation techniques have been developed. Software architecture assessment

18
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,450
method, or SAAM. I'm going to show you a slide on this. It's, is a relatively

19
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,860
informal one. More formal one developed at the Software Engineering Institute,

20
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,480
is the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method, or ATAM.
