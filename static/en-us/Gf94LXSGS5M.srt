00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,120
Well it's not something you are,
there's nothing biometric about it.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,864
It's a device that you
have that receives a code.

3
00:00:05,864 --> 00:00:09,767
Since there's a device that allows
you to authenticate yourself, and

4
00:00:09,767 --> 00:00:13,419
device is something you have,
this option would be the right one.

5
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:18,403
Okay, so the smartphones are essentially
being used as something you have

6
00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:22,610
part of the authentication
method that we're talking about.
