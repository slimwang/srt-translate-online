00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,130
The database we'll be working with in this course is:

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,320
MongoDB. There are a couple of reasons for that. One of

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,070
which is, since I work for MongoDB it would be bizarre

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,700
for me to do this using a different database and potentially

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,760
a career limiting move. But, the primary reason for talking

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,130
about MongoDB in this particular course is because it makes a

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,410
lot of sense for data analysis applications. MongoDB is widely used

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,810
in big data. And, it's the leading no sequel database. Now,

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,490
while MongoDB is a no sequel database. The term

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,640
we, we most commonly use is document database. Let me

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,000
talk a little bit about what we mean by that.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,800
We're not talking about a database for storing PDF documents

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,480
or Microsoft Word documents. What we mean by documents is

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,220
an associative array. Now, this is the same type of

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,930
structure that you see in a JSON object. Or a

16
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:50,230
PHP array. A Python dictionary or Ruby hash, and similar

17
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,980
data structures in other programming languages. MongoDB allows

18
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,670
us to store these types of hierarchical data structures.

19
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,360
Directly in the database as individual items or

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,920
documents. Now the documents stored in mongoDB use a

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,030
JSON like syntax. I say JSON like because

22
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,180
mongoDB is more flexible with the use of quotes

23
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,010
and other small syntaxical elements than strict JSON.

24
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,520
And yes, it is somewhat oxymoronic to describe anything

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,230
Javascript related as strict.
