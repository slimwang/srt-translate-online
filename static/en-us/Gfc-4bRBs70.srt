1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,845
So then I said that
Android isn't a horse.

2
00:00:01,845 --> 00:00:05,689
>> [LAUGH] One sec.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,865
Sorry my phone appears to be crashing.

4
00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:09,005
>> That's not good.

5
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:09,925
>> No kidding.

6
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:12,705
I think it has something to
do with Shopping List ++.

7
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:14,879
Ever since I downloaded
the newest version and

8
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:17,760
started using it my phone's
been really sluggish.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,800
And sometimes it feels like it gets
super warm, which is pleasant during

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,360
the cool nights I spend coding, but
probably isn't great for the phone.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,032
>> Hmm, any ideas what could
be causing the slow down?

12
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:31,990
>> Hm, well I've been so wrapped up
with getting the features out the door,

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,100
I haven't even thought about
what might be going on.

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,630
It's probably some sort of memory leak,
and

15
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,640
it probably has something to do
with not cleaning up the listeners.

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,100
Right, I'm looking at the docs now,

17
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,400
there's a detach listener
that looks useful.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,300
>> Hm, well I'm surprised that or
Walter or one of the other users

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,310
hasn't complained-
>> No!

20
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,855
My phone!

21
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:52,255
It died!

22
00:00:52,255 --> 00:00:53,609
Why?

23
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:55,855
>> Shoot, I should probably
see what that was all about.

24
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:57,835
>> Wait!

25
00:00:57,835 --> 00:00:59,635
Well, I got the docs here.

26
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:02,303
At least you and
I can go over removing listeners, and

27
00:01:02,303 --> 00:01:03,615
maybe you can fix the app.

28
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:06,315
The code you're looking for
is removeEventListner.

29
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:09,220
To use this method,
you'll pass in the event listener.

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,965
However, the single location
has multiple listeners,

31
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:16,410
you need to make sure to go through and
remove each listener.

32
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,030
Keep in mind this doesn't
remove child listeners.

33
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,830
You'll need to call
removeEventListner(childEventListener)

34
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,740
for any child listeners.

35
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,690
Lastly, Fire based list adapters
will also need to be cleaned up.

36
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,170
Generally, you should keep
a reference to every listener and

37
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,490
location you add, and
then remove them in an onDestroy method.

38
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,241
However, for Firebase list adapters you
can call the handy cleanup method to

39
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:44,935
have them self destruct and destroy
any references they're holding on to.

40
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:46,715
>> Okay, what did I miss?

41
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:48,315
>> Is everything okay?

42
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:49,955
>> Well, Kagure's okay.

43
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:52,275
Her phone, poor thing.

44
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:55,271
>> I told the developer about
removing event listeners.

45
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:56,035
>> Great.

46
00:01:56,035 --> 00:01:58,300
Can you remove them and
then fix up the memory leak?
