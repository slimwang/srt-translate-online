1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,040
In storyboard,

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,250
Apple refers to a transition between
view controllers as a segue.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,710
These segues are depicted using this

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,370
gray arrow that's interrupted
by this circular icon.

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,530
You can see a lot of segues and
storyboard for

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,270
this make your own adventure app.

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,610
Which you'll see a lot more of if
you stick around for lesson 5.

8
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:23,310
Here on the roll the dice method of our
role view controller dot swift file,

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,660
we saw how to present view
controller's programatically.

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,580
Now we're going to move onto a second
way of presenting view controllers,

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,390
by combining code with
a storyboard Segway.

12
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,480
Now, I don't want any tears, but

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,420
first we have to delete all of the code
code in our roll the dice method.

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,350
Back in storyboard we're going
to open up our pop up menu for

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,810
the role view controller.

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,010
And under triggered segues we're going
to drag this manual segue to the dice

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,380
view controller.

18
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,140
Here we have a few options for
the segue.

19
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,920
I'm going to choose modal here.

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,550
But we'll talk more about the push and

21
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,180
custom options when we get
into the navigation lesson.

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,770
Next we need to set the storyboard
identifier for our segue.

23
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,710
So let's close this outline view and
open up the utilities pane and

24
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,540
then if we click on the segue we can
see in the attributes of inspector

25
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,340
where we can set
the storyboard identifier.

26
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,940
So we'll call it roll dice.

27
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,180
Now we have our segue from storyboard.

28
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,500
But we need to write
the code that calls it.

29
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,000
We want the segue to happen
when the dice is rolled.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,054
So we go into the rollTheDice method
in our RollViewController.swift file.

31
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:31,270
Here we're going to invoke the method
performSegueWithIdentifier.

32
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,360
And our identifier,
of course, is rollDice, and

33
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,450
our sender is self okay let's run it and
see what happens when we roll the dice.

34
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,440
You can see that a new view is
appearing but other was no dice.

35
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,690
Why would that be?

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,210
Well we never set their values.

37
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,240
And in fact our first view controller
never even had a reference to the dice

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,190
view controller.

39
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,740
Let alone the dice.

40
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,510
So how are we going to
set those dice values.

41
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,090
Let's leave that question open for
now and posture review the steps for

42
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,080
creating the segway.
