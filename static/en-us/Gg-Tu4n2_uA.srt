1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
As easily seen, the mean is 0.6. Hope you got that right.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The variance ends at 0.24, surprisingly it's 0.6*1-0.6

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and determine the right here is 0.0304 in approximation.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And that means with a thousand samples, we are really confident that the mean is 0.6

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and we are only willing to consider a deviation of 0.03.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now I ask you, do you think this gets evidence that this is a fair coin?

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You'd say absolutely no because the confidence interval is so small.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This is where the square root of N really helps us really drives the size of the confidence interval down.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The more the sample size, the better for us. The more confident we are in our result.
