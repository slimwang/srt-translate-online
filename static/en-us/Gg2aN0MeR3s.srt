1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,340
Let's apply the work and span concepts
now in a more abstract setting.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,990
So, consider the two reduction DAGs.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,390
My question is,
what is the span of each DAG?

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,840
We'll do this again as multiple choice.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,900
For each DAG, choose the best option.
