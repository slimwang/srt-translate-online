1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,890
The Simplex method as
it is described here,

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,687
was first published by
George Dantzig in 1947.

3
00:00:06,687 --> 00:00:10,110
Fourier apparently had a similar
idea in the early 19th century, and

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,130
Leonid Kantorovichhad already used
the method to help the Soviet Army

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:14,726
in World War II.

6
00:00:14,726 --> 00:00:17,480
In was Danzig's publication however,

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,670
that led to the widespread application
of the method to industry.

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,850
As the lessons of operation
research learned from the war,

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,670
began to be applied to the wider economy
and fuel the post-war economic boom.

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,770
It remains a popular algorithm today.

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,645
As practical as the algorithm was,

12
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:35,717
theoretical guarantees on
its performance remain poor.

13
00:00:35,717 --> 00:00:41,430
And in fact in 1972, showed that the
worst case complexity is exponential.

14
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,270
It wasn't until 1979, that Khachiyan
published the ellipsoid algorithm, and

15
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,270
showed that linear programs can
be solved in polynomial time.

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,860
His results were improved upon in 1984
by Karmarkar, whose method turned

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,470
out to be practical enough to be
competitive with the Simplex method for

18
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,279
real world problems.

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,260
Both of these algorithms take shortcuts
through the middle of the polyhedron,

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,260
instead of always going
from vertex to vertex.

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,770
In the next lecture,

22
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,840
we'll talk about the duality paradigm,
which rises out of linear programming.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,830
And has been the source of many insights
and the inspiration for new algorithms.

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,910
Even with a whole other lesson however,

25
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,440
we're only going to be able
to scratch the surface

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,240
of the huge body of knowledge
surrounding this fundamental problem.

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,190
That has shown itself to be of deep
importance in both theory and practice.
