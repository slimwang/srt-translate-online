1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:05,072
Well, for the first question, we know that we're going to loop through this code 64 times,

2
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:08,544
and we're going to do one multiplication for each iteration,

3
00:00:08,544 --> 00:00:11,361
so that's going to take 64 multiplications.

4
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:15,552
And for the second question, we know that each one of these iterations is going to proceed serially,

5
00:00:15,552 --> 00:00:17,700
one after another after another.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,701
So for each of these 64 iterations, it's going to take us 2 nanoseconds.

7
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:26,229
If we multiply those together, we'll see that the answer is 128 nanoseconds.
