1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,935
Afterwards, go ahead and start BlueJ, and follow along what I'm doing here.

2
00:00:03,935 --> 00:00:10,580
Select the Project Option, open a project, navigate to the folder into which

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:16,011
you have unzipped the starter code, go to lesson one and then to hello, and

4
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:22,140
here you get an icon that represents out first program. Double-click on it, and

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,580
a window pops up with the program code. Here again is the line that I said is

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,210
the most important one. We'll have a closer look at the bits and pieces of the

7
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,130
statement later, but right now let me show you how to execute a program. Click

8
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,670
on the button that says Compile. Now your program is translated from the Java

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,360
language into a lower-level language that the computer can execute efficiently.

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,360
We don't normally have to worry about that process, except we have to remember

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,620
to hit the Compile button before running the program. Now back in the main

12
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:02,700
display, right-click on this box. Select the second line that contains the word

13
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:08,490
main, and that launches the main part of our program. You get a dialogue here

14
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,310
where you should simply click OK. As soon as you do that, another window pops

15
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:17,080
up and [UNKNOWN], here's our greeting, Hello World. Now, of course, I want you

16
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,820
to change the greeting and print something else, and I want you to show me what

17
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,770
you did. Here we'll use the Udacity coding environment, and not BlueJay to give

18
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,620
us any of the code that you have developed. Let me show you that. Whenever we

19
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,270
want you to submit programming work, you will see a screen such as the

20
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,600
following. Here we give you a bit of starter code, and some instructions on

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,560
what we want you to do. Right now it says, please print Hello Udacity. You can

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,410
type your answer in here. Or even better, you can first do the answer in BlueJ

23
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:53,520
and then just paste it in here. To test your program, scroll down and click the

24
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,790
Test Run button. And here you see the program output. Once you're happy, click

25
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,920
the Submit button. That way we get your work, and get you feedback. In this

26
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,890
case, that it was correct. Now, it's your turn to try it. Sarah will walk you

27
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,210
through your very first programming assignment. Good luck.
