1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So that suggests a strategy for finding a large prime--

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which is to keep trying guesses until we find one that's prime.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
If it's not a prime, then we add 1 and we try again.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Because of what we know about the number of primes being finite

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and the density of primes, we know that after a reasonable number of iterations

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
this will actually find a prime and return that value.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We could do a little better if we assume we start with an odd number

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and we'll assert that X is not divisible by 2

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
since that is very obvious that it would be prime

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and increment by 2 here.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What's missing is we need some way to do this "is prime" test.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So here is a naive way to test to the finest prime.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We're going to go through the numbers from 2 to X minus 1,

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
checking whether X is divisible by each of those.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If it is divisible by any of those,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that would mean that it is a composite number

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and we should return False.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If we try them all and it's not divisible by any of those, well then it's prime.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So the question is: Would this work?

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The possible answers are: Yes, this would work fine.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No, it's too slow because the running time is exponential in the value of X.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No because it's too slow because the running time is exponential in the size of X.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And no, because there's a silly bug in my Python code.
