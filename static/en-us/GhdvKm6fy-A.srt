1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So let's go through a possible answer together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Once again, the real trick is just coming up with a good regular expression,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
so we can't have a space, a left angle, or a right angle,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but we can have 1 or more copies of anything else,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and we'll just return the token unchanged

6
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
because that's what we are asked to do.
