1
00:00:00,752 --> 00:00:03,790
All right, so we're back in our source
file where we had the to do item to

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,372
make this UDACITY_ORANGE
into UDACITY_BLUE.

3
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:09,910
And if we scroll up to the top of
the file we actually see that we defined

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,500
a couple of constants for
UDACITY_ORANGE and UDACITY_BLUE.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,050
So all we need to do is
highlight UDACITY_ORANGE and

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,270
make it into UDACITY_BLUE instead.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,660
Let's try running this
on our Android device.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,592
So we've got the old
orange version running.

9
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:29,650
Let's go ahead and tell Android Studio
to launch the new blue version.

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,610
Aha, there we go.

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,830
Much easier on the eyes.
