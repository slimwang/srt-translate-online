00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,340
Input processor provides three call
backs for dealing with touches and

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,850
clicks.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,180
Touches and clicks are actually
handled in the same way and

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,300
are just referred to as touches.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,050
Actually, this program I'm drawing
on uses a very similar system

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,790
to determine when to draw the lines.

7
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,730
For instance,

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,950
as my pen touches this screen,
a touched down signal is received.

9
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,800
That means it's time to
start drawing a line.

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,740
As I move the pen the program is
continually receiving touch dragged

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,330
notifications, meaning that it's time
to draw a little bit more of the line.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,280
Finally, when I reach the end
of my line and I remove the pen,

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,330
there's a touch up call that says
alright stop drawing the line now.

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,970
Note that the touch or click coordinates
provided in these call backs

15
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,080
is always provided in terms
of screen coordinates.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,080
If you want to get the position of
a touch in your world coordinates,

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,400
you will need to convert from
screen to world coordinates.

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,370
Let's check out how to do that.
