>> We know y equals 3, so which equation do you think it's easier to plug into,

2
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:09,281
the first or the second? I would argue it's easier to plug into the second one.

3
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:13,967
X is already solved for, so if I plug in 3 for y I can easily find the value of

4
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:18,420
x. So I get x is negative 4. If you used this equation, that would have worked,

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,973
too. You still should have gotten x equal to negative 4.
