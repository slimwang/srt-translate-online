Before we speak to Doctor

00:00:02,093 --> 00:00:06,064
let's discuss the basics of Operant Conditioning. Now Operant Conditioning

4
00:00:06,064 --> 00:00:09,155
looks at consequences of behavior. We have the A, B, C's of Operant

5
00:00:09,155 --> 00:00:15,012
Conditioning. The A is the antecedent. There has to be a queue and a motivation

6
00:00:15,012 --> 00:00:19,072
to perform the behavior. As you will see, Doctor

7
00:00:19,072 --> 00:00:19,624
[UNKNOWN]

8
00:00:19,624 --> 00:00:25,577
uses a target as the queue. The fish reward or the praise is the motivation to

9
00:00:25,577 --> 00:00:31,430
do the behavior. One thing we should note is that fish is a primary reinforcer

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:37,346
and praise is a secondary reinforcer. So food would be a primary reinforcement

11
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:41,900
because we need it. Praise is a secondary or conditioned reinforcer because we

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,221
learn to enjoy praise. Next we have B, which as you might have guessed, is

13
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:51,666
behavior. The behavior you saw on the first clip was a kiss from Saki, the sea

14
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:56,835
lion. And finally, C, which is the consequence. By getting the fish or the

15
00:00:56,835 --> 00:01:02,144
praise, we increase the likelihood of repeating the behavior in the future. So

16
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:05,987
in this case with the kiss, the consequence was something good. Saki received

17
00:01:05,987 --> 00:01:10,438
praise and a fish for giving the kiss. However, if the consequence for the kiss

18
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:14,440
was something bad, it would decrease the likelihood of the behavior.
