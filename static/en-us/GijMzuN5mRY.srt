00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,347
Now you've done a lot of work with numbers and most people think that numbers

2
00:00:03,347 --> 00:00:07,570
are what computers are really good at. But truth be told many programmers work

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:13,880
more with text than numbers. In Java the technical term for text is a string.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,854
Why a string? You can think of text being a sequence of individual letters that

5
00:00:18,854 --> 00:00:24,932
are strung together. You have already seen strings. In Java, their enclosed in

6
00:00:24,932 --> 00:00:30,020
quotes and there's some text inside. You've seen string variables, here is one,

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,728
it's called name and it's type is string. You've seen a bunch of string methods

8
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:39,752
and here are a few more. In the interest of learn by doing, go ahead, fire up

9
00:00:39,752 --> 00:00:45,249
BlueJ. And tell me what happens when you call each of these methods, or in the

10
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:49,500
last case, when you execute this piece of code.
