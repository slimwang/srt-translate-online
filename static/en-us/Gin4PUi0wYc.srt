1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,750
The latest modern malware is APT,
or advanced persistent threat.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,240
They tend to target
specific organizations,

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,440
while as botnets tend to have
bots all over the internet.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,430
APT is advanced, which means
that is uses special malware.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,860
Sometimes, the malware is
specifically crafted for

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,630
the targeted organization, but very
often the malware's actually a special

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,720
version of a common malware that
has to be used in other botnets.

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,450
By starting from a common malware,

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,840
the attackers behind APT's want to
have both convenience and deniability.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,230
That is, security admins would not
suspect that the malware is APT.

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,030
They would think that this is a new
version of the common malware.

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,780
Advance can also mean
special operations.

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,240
That is, APT is not used for
common attacks and

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,040
frauds, such as spamming and
click fraud or phishing.

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,470
Rather, it can be used for

16
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,950
very high value operations, such as
stealing the design of a new airplane.

17
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:04,640
APT's persistent, meaning that once
the malware gets into an organization,

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,130
it's going to stay there for
a long time.

19
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,780
And it typically
involves multiple steps.

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,470
Each step is low and
slow, to avoid detection.

21
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,150
For example, one of them sending
out the design of the airplane,

22
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,620
which is a large volume of
data to the internet at once.

23
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,860
The APT can break the data
into multiple chunks.

24
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,340
And then it can sent each
chunk to the internet,

25
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,630
whenever there is a user connecting
to the internet, that is,

26
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,930
the transmission of each chunk of
data will not raise any suspicion.

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,670
APT is a very dangerous threat because,
as we have discussed,

28
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,620
APTs tend to target high value
organizations and information.
