00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,343
Our first step is going to be to calculate m, the amount of money that Grant

2
00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:08,542
spends each month. Here are the two important pieces of information that we got

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:13,042
from the question. We can replace fixed costs with 20,000. Since we know that

4
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:17,692
each wiper set costs $10 to make, and Grant makes n wiper sets, going to have

5
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:22,867
20,000 plus 10n equaling m. That means we can now take this quantity and replace

6
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:27,807
it in the spot of m in our equation for p. Since we're subtracting m, we need to

7
00:00:27,807 --> 00:00:32,958
make sure that we're subtracting this entire quantity, both terms. This looks

8
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:37,795
pretty good right now, but remember you want to replace n here. With the

9
00:00:37,795 --> 00:00:43,675
expression that we found in terms of c which was just negative 200c plus 18,000.

10
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:49,444
Now, we can finally go through and simplify our equation. This gives us a final

11
00:00:49,444 --> 00:00:54,925
equation for p of, miraculously, negative 200c squared plus 20,000c minus

12
00:00:54,925 --> 00:00:55,649
200,000.
