00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,012
Writing a story isn't easy.

2
00:00:02,012 --> 00:00:04,660
Building one about your business
that captivate your audience and

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,550
teaches them the value you
provide is even harder.

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,280
Now you have just a few minutes
to pitch your idea, and

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,820
it's possible to lose our attention
in the first ten seconds.

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,220
So what do you do?

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,320
In this lesson, we'll figure that out.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,420
We'll take all the work
you've done thus far and

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,310
organize it into a compelling story.

10
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,590
You'll learn how to present the story,
overcome any objections, and

11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,250
refine your pitch over time.

12
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,038
By the end of this lesson, you'll have
a pitch you can use to help secure

13
00:00:28,038 --> 00:00:30,284
investment, build your team,
and grow your business.

14
00:00:30,284 --> 00:00:31,457
So welcome to the lesson.

15
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:34,370
You've got an amazing story to tell,
so let's get started writing it.
