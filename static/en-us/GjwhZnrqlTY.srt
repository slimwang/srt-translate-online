1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And now I'm going to be really demanding.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I would like to know what is the variance of the mean, not the sum, but the mean.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm going to put 1/N over here--the same sum as before.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is what you do, for example, when you compute the mean outcome of an election from a sample

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
of size N. You take the sum of the things you saw and you compute the mean.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's the formula of the mean, but now I'm asking what's the variance of the mean.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So I'm not asking for this one over here--we asking for this one over here.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And as a hint, at some point we talked about something like the following--

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
what if you multiple a variable by a constant A, what happens to its variance?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It was something times variance X.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's do the first. What goes in there.
