1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now let's ask what we expect the variance to be when we generate a couple of data points,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
say by flipping coins.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There are 4 possibilities: 0 and 0, 1 and 0, 0 and 1, and 1 and 1.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In each case, compute the variance and then compute the average of the variances

5
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or the expected variance.
