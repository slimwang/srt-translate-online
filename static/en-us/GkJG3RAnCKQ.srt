Good designers emphasize with the people they're designing for. That's what the

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:10,290
seven questions that you discovered with Chelsea are all about. Your

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,070
job is to make sure that the people using the product, can always find the

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,510
answers. Now, those seven questions complete the formal

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:26,000
course material. One thing left. To put it all together. That's what the final

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,490
project is about. It's a fun one. You get to

00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,600
put together all the things you've learned. Plus the design

00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,380
skills from the other projects, into a real project. Something

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,750
you can actually build into a real, manufactured product. Have fun.
