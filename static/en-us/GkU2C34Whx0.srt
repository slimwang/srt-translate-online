1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,430
So, we have our Set Time object, and we've

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,290
created that relationship between Set Time to Bands and Stages.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,245
>> Mm-hm.

4
00:00:06,245 --> 00:00:09,340
>> Now, that's great, but there are probably a few other things about

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,510
Set Time that we want to track, like, for example, we took that Pic-less

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,990
field that was a list of times and now turned it into this

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,850
whole object, so we probably want to track

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,430
what times these bands are playing at.

9
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,120
>> Mm-hm.

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,070
>> Or, maybe the status of what's going on with the set time link?

11
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,150
>> It was cancelled or

12
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:25,980
confirmed or whatever.

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,660
>> Yeah. So we can do that right there

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,360
from the Schema Builder and keep building out our object.
