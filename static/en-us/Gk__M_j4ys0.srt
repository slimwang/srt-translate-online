00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,670
To illustrate how joinable threads work, let's take a look

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,762
at a very simple program. We first create a thread,

3
00:00:05,762 --> 00:00:07,853
and then we can't be sure what's going to happen

4
00:00:07,853 --> 00:00:11,230
next. Perhaps the main thread will keep control and print

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,250
his hello message, or perhaps the created thread will get

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,860
control and print his hello message. It's indeterminate. In any

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,490
case, however, the main thread is going to execute this

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,370
join procedure. It specifies which thread it wants to join and

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,190
gives an address where the return value can

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,390
be passed. Only when the created thread is

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,450
finished will the pthread_join call complete. So we

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,880
can be sure that Done will be printed last.
