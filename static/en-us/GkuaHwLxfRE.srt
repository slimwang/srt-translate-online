1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,370
So, here's what the @Index annotation looks like if

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,990
we only want the city to be indexed, but

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,530
it's not the default city. So @Index, and then

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,690
we add, if not default.class, then the index, the

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,550
property name, which is city, and then here we

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,410
just specify the default value which is default city.

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,080
And if the city Is created without a value,

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,375
it's going to get the default city as its value and

9
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:28,590
it's not going to be indexed. We can actually also

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,950
see that in the admin console on local host.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,970
Here's two conferences that I created, and you can

12
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,780
see it tells us that they're not indexed, even though

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,070
these two are indexed because they have values. These

14
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,270
two conferences are not indexed. So, I encourage you

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,430
to explore the documentation in Objectify to learn about

16
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,730
different ways to conditionalize how you can index your properties.
