00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,760
Although you guys were arguing a lot earlier, it

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,430
really did seem that your ideas compliment one another in

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,320
a way that gives us a global perspective on how

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,140
traits exist and are passed down from generation to generation.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,010
>> Yeah, like Mendel. Your theory does a

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,290
really good job of explaining how traits skip generations.

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,480
>> And, Skinner, I guess you do have a

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,970
handle on understanding how the environment affects various traits. And

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,800
I suppose you guys did a pretty good job

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,850
of explaining the biological components. But, I bet the genome

11
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,240
has still many more secrets, that we don't even know.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,460
>> Based on the fabulous work you guys did along with many others,

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,860
we knew what the hereditary material did, before we even knew what it was.

14
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,460
>> Although DNA, the hereditary material, was first isolated

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,600
in 1869 It's exact nature was a mystery until 1953 when work

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,350
by Rosalyn Franklin, Maurice Wilkins, James Watson, and Francis Crick

17
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,370
revealed the structure, and began to unravel the secretes of

18
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,370
how DNA codes for many of our traits. And we've

19
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,830
come a long way since then as well. We've learned

20
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,200
how DNA makes up our genomes and codes for many

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,410
of our traits. And technology's advancing at an ever-increasing pace,

22
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,990
allowing people to obtain personal information about their very own

23
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,060
DNA. We're in an unique age of genomic information, and

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,490
this course is going to give you an introductory look

25
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,290
at how you can use this information.
