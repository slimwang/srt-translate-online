1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,969
To create our histogram of user ages, let's start by using

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,273
the Q plot function. We'll pass it the variable age. And our

3
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:10,011
data set is pseudo Facebook so PF. And I'm going to add

4
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:13,749
some color using the color and fill parameters. Running this code we

5
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:16,733
see we get our histogram. Now you might have tried a variety

6
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:19,426
of bin widths. And in this case I think a bin width

7
00:00:19,426 --> 00:00:22,620
of one is the best. So let's add that in here. I

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,280
chose a bin width of one since, one makes sense, since we're

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,370
going by years or ages. This gives me a histogram of

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,340
counts of users by individual years, so I can get a

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,010
finer view of the data for say, like, 25 years old.

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,510
By setting the bin width equal to one, it allows us

13
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,030
to more easily spot unusual spikes in our data. Points like

14
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,380
here, here, and definitely out here. Let's zoom in on this

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,280
plot and take a closer look. I see the largest spikes

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,300
in the mid to late 20's. And we don't have any users

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,290
who put in an age lower than 13 at the left

18
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,570
of the histogram. This makes sense because users must be at least

19
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,680
13 years old to set up a Facebook account. Now there's also

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,830
some unusual spikes above 100, but my guess is that some users

21
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,640
may be exaggerating their age. Do you have any friends who that

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,190
are 100 years or older on Facebook? I know I certainly don't.

23
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,000
And one final comment that I want to make is that your x-axis

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,550
might look slightly different than mine. Remember that we can use scale

25
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,258
x discrete or scale x continuous to change this appearance.

26
00:01:19,258 --> 00:01:21,725
So I adding scale x discrete here, I can set the

27
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:25,070
breaks so they run from 0 to 113, and they

28
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,340
increment every five units, or every five years. Now you might

29
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,300
be wondering why I chose 113 here, and I have

30
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,990
a simple answer for you. I just used the maximum age

31
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,460
in our user data set. Remember I can find that

32
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,570
out by running Summary on that variable. So I can see

33
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,621
the minimum age is 13, and the maximum age is 113.
