00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,100
Now that you know about the importance
of not exaggerating your data.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,520
Let's create an appropriate scale so
we can draw our circles correctly.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,630
We have our x scale from before and
we also have our y scale from before.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,520
So, let's create a variable and
the variable called r for

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,170
drawing the circles.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,145
Remember that in
the gapminder visualization,

7
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:26,289
the size of each circle represents
the population of each country.

8
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:31,922
So the area of the circle for
China has to correspond to 1.38 billion.

9
00:00:31,922 --> 00:00:35,258
The area of a circle is
equal to the constant

10
00:00:35,258 --> 00:00:40,320
pi which is about 3.14
times the radius squared.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,020
We need to figure out the radius
in order to draw circles on to our

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,950
SVG canvass.

13
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,675
So the Population is
equal to the Area and

14
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:51,251
we know that's equal to Pi r squared.

15
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:55,301
So if we divide both sides
of our equation by Pi.

16
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:57,274
[BLANK_AUDIO]

17
00:00:57,274 --> 00:01:02,873
Then we can simply take the square
root of both sides to isolate r.

18
00:01:02,873 --> 00:01:07,857
So the radius should be equal to
the square root of our population

19
00:01:07,857 --> 00:01:09,066
divided by PI.

20
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:13,361
It turns out that by multiplying by
a constant factor such as one of our Pi,

21
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:18,320
doesn't affect the relationship
between the radius and the population.

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,400
We really just need to capture that
it's a square root relationship.

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,990
This means the radius is really
just equal to the square root of

24
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,670
the population times some constant,
which we can ignore in this case.

25
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,110
To make this aspect of
the constant clearer,

26
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,720
let's say that you're looking at
this poster of the visualization.

27
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,740
If you viewed this
graphic from farther and

28
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,720
farther away, all the circles get
smaller by the same distance since

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,110
your eyes are a certain
distance from the graphic.

30
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,230
The proportionality of the circles
stays the same no matter

31
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,570
if you come closer to the graphic or if
you stand farther away from the graphic.

32
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,390
Now let's see if you can create
a scale to map population values

33
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,920
to radius values.
