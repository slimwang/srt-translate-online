00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,020
What does it mean to evaluate
opportunity cost and

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,080
how can you use it to make better
decisions for your business?

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,850
As an entrepreneur,
you're going to face a ton of decisions,

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,250
and you'll have to adapt to
new situations as they unfold.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,230
What if new opportunities come up.

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,630
What if things take
longer than expected or

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,180
maybe things actually go
quicker than you thought.

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,430
When this happens, you'll need to
change gears and adjust your direction.

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,480
But how do you know which way to go?

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,640
One way to figure this out is to
evaluate the opportunity cost of your

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,880
decisions.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,530
So what's opportunity cost?

13
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,440
Opportunity cost is the loss of
potential gain from other alternatives

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,845
when one alternative is chosen.

15
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:42,025
In other words, every decision you make
has a potential gain associated with it.

16
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:43,925
And any time you choose one option,

17
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:47,045
you're missing out on the potential
gains of a different option.

18
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:49,095
It's up to you to compare
each decision and

19
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:51,875
determine which one has
the most potential gain.

20
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,793
This will minimize the opportunity
cost of the direction you take.

21
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:56,589

22
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,987
Here's a few questions you can ask
yourself to help evaluate your

23
00:00:58,987 --> 00:00:59,980
opportunity cost.

24
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,470
Is there something I
could be doing right now

25
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,800
that would be a better use of my time?

26
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,590
Is there any way I could be managing
my resources better and how could I put

27
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,510
myself on my team in a position to
make the best use of their skills?

28
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,360
Any time that you're not doing these
things as effectively as you could be

29
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,720
your actions have some opportunity
cost associated with them.

30
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,700
There are more specific values you
can start to place on these numbers.

31
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,860
But getting this basic mindset
is a great place to start.

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,030
Moving forward, try to think,
what else could I be doing right now?

33
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,950
Is there a way my time, money, or
resources could be better spent?

34
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,470
From there, you can start weighing
the opportunity cost of each

35
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,180
decision you make.
