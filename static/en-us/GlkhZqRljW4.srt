Six x plus 36, and five x plus ten, are our new numerators. Great work if you

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,732
found those two. We know we're really just distributing the six to the x and the

3
00:00:10,732 --> 00:00:16,810
six. So six times x is six-x. And six times six is 36. For this new numerator,

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:22,281
we're distributing the five times x, which is five-x. And 5 times 2 which is 10.

5
00:00:22,282 --> 00:00:25,929
So, 5x plus 10 is our new numerator.
