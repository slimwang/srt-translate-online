00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This will be in dynamic programming question for a robot

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
with 3 coordinates, X, Y and theta,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
even though in this diagram I just show 2.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Suppose our target location is in the top right corner

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
facing east as shown over here.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Initially, the robot's location is in the bottom left corner facing north.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Suppose our goal is worth 100.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Going straight costs us -1,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and we can turn on the spot, but turning on the spot

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
costs us -5.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What would be the value of the start state?
