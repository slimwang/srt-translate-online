1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,340
I've clicked on one of
the paint records, and

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,920
now I've got the Paint Profiler.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,650
Inside the Paint Profiler there
are a few things to pay attention to.

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,050
First off,
there is a whole new timeline here.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,070
There is a list of paint commands.

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,670
And then there is the part of
the page that was painted.

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,990
Notice that, right now, this timeline
is the entire paint command, and

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,620
you see that it's the entire
page that got painted.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,260
But if you limit the timeline
to just a small part,

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,970
you'll see what was painted then.

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,470
This is a fantastic tool to see
exactly what the browser is

12
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,100
painting at different points.

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,440
Here I've gone to this random
point in the middle of the paint,

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,300
and you can see that white box is
where some text is being painted.

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,280
Here on the side you can see
the drawTextBlob commands.

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,020
Going back to the whole timeline for
the paint,

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,678
you can see the first one is save, and
that is the answer to this question.

18
00:00:43,678 --> 00:00:46,380
I want to point out one last thing,
and that is that all of these paint

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,140
commands, these green bars here,
are really close to the 60 fps line.

20
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,300
So right now it's running at 60 fps, but
it's extremely close to the budget, and

21
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,830
if there are any other work going on,

22
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,570
chances are you won't be
hitting 60 frames per second.

23
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,360
So let's see what you can do about it.

24
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,190
But first, the correct answer is save.
