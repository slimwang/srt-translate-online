Sarah has just shown you how to implement some methods of the person class. And

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,950
here were are back with the car, and ready to implement the remaining methods.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,400
Just to remind you, so far, we've implemented two methods. Add gas and drive.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,910
And when we drive the car, we can see that it has driven. But we have no way of

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,960
finding out exactly how much. So let's fix that. We need to add a method that

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,580
one can call to find out how many miles the car has driven. Here is the method

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,030
header. And here is the implementation. Note this return statement. That

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:34,240
indicates that this method returns a value, namely, the miles driven. Over

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,020
here, you didn't have a return statement because the method had return type

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,900
void. It didn't return an answer. The method over here has return type double,

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,770
and it does return an answer. Any time you implement an accessor, you need to

12
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,370
provide a return statement. Alright, now it's you're turn again. Go ahead and

13
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,300
implement this method. Just put your code in the box.
