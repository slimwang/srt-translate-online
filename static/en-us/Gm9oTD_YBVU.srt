00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Your goal for this quiz is to define a procedure,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
is_friend, that takes a string as its input, and outputs a Boolean value

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
indicating if the input string is the name of a friend.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This would be very hard to do, in general,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but we're going to assume that I have a very strict policy on friends.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm friends with everyone whose name begins with the letter "D"--and no one else.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So if the input name begins with the letter "D", your procedure should output True;

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
otherwise, it should output False.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So, for example, if we did: print is_friend('Diane'),

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the output should be True and if we did:

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
print is_friend('Fred'),

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
you should see the output False.
