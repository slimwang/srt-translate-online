1
00:00:03,513 --> 00:00:06,231
I still don't like
the resolution on these images.

2
00:00:06,231 --> 00:00:07,008
>> Darn it.

3
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:09,721
Yeah, a lot of people have been
commenting about how the sheep just

4
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:10,794
don't look real enough.

5
00:00:10,794 --> 00:00:13,452
[SOUND]
>> And didn't your investors say

6
00:00:13,452 --> 00:00:17,271
something about wanting you to
identify a larger target audience?

7
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:19,176
>> Yeah, well, maybe.

8
00:00:19,176 --> 00:00:22,869
I'm starting to wonder if Bale Buddy
is going to be the destructive and

9
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:25,573
transformative app that
I originally dreamed of.

10
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:27,895
>> There might not be enough
shepherds in the Bay Area.

11
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:29,972
It's too small a market.

12
00:00:29,972 --> 00:00:34,256
Baa, hey,
don't bleat yourself up about it.

13
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:37,496
>> Ha-ha, real funny.

14
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:40,816
All right, well,
back to the drawing board.

15
00:00:40,816 --> 00:00:42,350
Let's see.

16
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,879
I'm thinking some sort of
app maybe about like, crap.

17
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,013
Walter, did you forget
the whiteboard markers again?

18
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:52,195
>> I just went to the store,
you should've told me this earlier.

19
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:56,154
Kagure had the same problem yesterday
when we needed toilet paper and WD40.

20
00:00:56,154 --> 00:00:58,312
>> Yeah, it goes both ways.

21
00:00:58,312 --> 00:01:02,221
I was at the store picking up these
cheesy flakes, they were on sale.

22
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:04,925
And then, Walter did the same thing.

23
00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:07,108
But you know what,
I have dinner for next week.

24
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,911
[LAUGH]
>> Can't be good for your credit score.

25
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:10,463
>> Crap, I'm running out of gas money.

26
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:12,564
This is super inconvenient.

27
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:16,430
[SOUND] If only there was some
way that we could communicate,

28
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,380
something collaborative, that would
be right there in the store with you,

29
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,944
something like an app.

30
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,400
Great Scott, I've got an idea.
