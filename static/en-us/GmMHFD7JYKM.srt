00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,680
Now let's do a quiz.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,101
Suppose Alice and
Bob agree to use prime q = 23 and

3
00:00:07,101 --> 00:00:10,070
primitive root alpha = 5.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,290
And these numbers can be made public.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,391
And Alice chooses a secret, a = 6.

6
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:21,151
Likewise Bob chooses a secret, b = 15.

7
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:25,360
The question is,
what number does Alice send to Bob?

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,760
And that is the public number XA.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,500
Likewise, what number
does Bob send to Alice?

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,780
And that is the public number YB.
