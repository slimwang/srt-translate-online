1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,660
So, we've learned a little bit more about the relationship

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,340
between age and friend count. And we did that using

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,990
conditional means. We'll return to these two variables later and

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,560
we'll see the relationship to a third variable in less than

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,170
five. But for now, lets see how more used a

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,100
slightly different approach to pair a histogram to summarize her raw

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,670
data. So here's an example of how we paired raw

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,430
data with summary data. So, here we have these scatter plots,

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,910
where we're showing people's raw guesses of their perceived

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,970
audience size against their actual audience size. And you

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,390
can see they all fall below the perfect accuracy

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,200
line. So people underestimate. But it's still kind of hard

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,370
to get it the big picture from these scatter

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,010
plots and so, we have some histograms to capture

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,120
more summary data. In this case, these two histograms

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,580
show how much people over or underestimated their audience size.

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,665
So here on the left, at the 0 mark on the x axis, that's how many people

18
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:58,100
guessed their audience size perfectly. If they had

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,930
a lighter color blue, those are people that underestimated

20
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,310
their audience. So you can kind of see

21
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:09,260
how many people underestimated their audience by about 25%,

22
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,960
versus 50%, versus 75% and so on. The

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,090
darker blue are people who overestimated their audience size.

24
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,020
And you can just see from the

25
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,420
chart far fewer people overestimated their audience size.

26
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,675
If you look on the right side of these summary plots, this is for people's over

27
00:01:25,675 --> 00:01:28,170
underestimations when you ask them about the

28
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,080
whole month. How many people in general do

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,690
you think see your post? And you can

30
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,050
see that people don't underestimate quite as badly.
