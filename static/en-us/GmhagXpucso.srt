00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
A couple of mistakes—right on tactics—I just want to remind you about.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I mentioned them earlier, but a common startup error on day one

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
is let's price on cost.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We know how much it takes to build our product.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We'll just add a markup that is a profit,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and therefore we have a price.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
How hard can that be?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is typically not a strategic way to price.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You might end up here, but boy there's a lot more moves on the table.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What you really want to think about is not just your internal economics,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but the customer insight that you actually have.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I want you do think about, yes, pricing on cost is maybe the first place we start,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but are we leaving a ton of money on the table?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Because the alternative to pricing on cost is pricing on value.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
As we said earlier, you know now your customer segment's perception

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
of the value of your value prop.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Is it about time saved? New efficiency created?

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Remember we talked earlier about pains and gains for this customer segment.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What is it that they value?

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Why are you saving them a ton of money?

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now, customers don't necessarily feel that they want to pay this way,

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but smart marketeers and smart startup executivies

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
can convince customers that instead of paying on cost

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
they really ought to be thinking about that your company is unique

25
00:01:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and providing the most value—not just the cheapest product.
