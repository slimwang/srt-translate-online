1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,580
First, compiler backdoors.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,900
Is it A, a backdoor that is hard to
detect because it modifies machine code?

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,770
Or B, this backdoor can only be
used by the person who created it,

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,840
even if it is discovered by others?

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,246
C, this backdoor inserts backdoors into
other programs during compilation.

6
00:00:22,246 --> 00:00:25,150
So it's obviously C.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,470
Second, object code backdoors.

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,140
These are backdoors that
are inserted into machine code.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,650
So that's A.

10
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,630
Asymmetric backdoors.

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,210
This backdoor can only
be used by its creator,

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,520
because it is protected or
controlled by codographic schemes.
