00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,446
[SOUND] As you've seen,
Android Auto provides

2
00:00:04,446 --> 00:00:09,118
an integration between your phone and
your car.

3
00:00:09,118 --> 00:00:13,336
This allows you to make your phone
perform tasks without having to touch

4
00:00:13,336 --> 00:00:15,040
the phone display.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,720
This is great because the user
is driving, meaning they need

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,540
minimal distractions and they need
to keep their eyes on the road.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,215
One of the key features of
Android Auto is messaging support.

8
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:27,765
Let's have a quick look
at what this might like.

9
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:34,250
[SOUND]
>> Here's the message.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,059
Are you coming back to the studio for
filming?

11
00:00:39,491 --> 00:00:42,510
[SOUND]
>> Reply.

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,434
[SOUND]
>> What's the message?

13
00:00:45,434 --> 00:00:48,013
[SOUND]
>> Yes, in five minutes.

14
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:50,590
[SOUND]
>> Got it.

15
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,530
Here's your message.

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,760
Yes, in five minutes.

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,745
Do you want to send it?

18
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:56,451
[SOUND] Yes.

19
00:00:56,451 --> 00:00:59,210
[SOUND]
>> Sending message.

20
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,480
>> As you can see,
this is a very simple workflow.

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,470
In this lesson,
I'm going to show you the following.

22
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,090
How to get an existing sample for
notifications, how it works, and

23
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,670
then how to get it running.

24
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,180
Then, I'm going to show you
how to add extensions for

25
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,300
Android Auto Messaging, and then how
to test that messaging functionality

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,640
on the Android Auto Simulator.

27
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,890
Let's head back to the studio and
get started.
