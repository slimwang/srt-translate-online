1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,750
So, let's look at some of the trends

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,301
for magnetic disks over the years. The capacity of

3
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:08,693
magnetic disks, how much data fits on a single

4
00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:13,218
disk, has actually been improving exponentially at the rate

5
00:00:13,218 --> 00:00:18,180
of about two per one or two years for a while. So things are getting better. We

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,505
get more and more data per magnetic disk. The

7
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:25,585
seek time has consistently been five to ten milliseconds

8
00:00:25,585 --> 00:00:28,305
over a number of years, with very slow

9
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:32,752
improvement. The only things that really improve the

10
00:00:32,752 --> 00:00:34,602
seek time is if we either make a

11
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:37,710
faster motor that can still move the head assembly

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,020
very precisely, which is very hard to do.

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,230
Or if we make the platter smaller so that

14
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,430
we traverse a smaller distance. So there has

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,710
been some recent improvement in that we have gone

16
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,750
from five inch diameter disks to three and a half, to more recently two and a

17
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:01,141
half and even smaller. So there has been some improvement in seek time, mainly

18
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:06,780
because the disks have shrunk. The speed of rotation for disks

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,584
has actually been improving. It went from 5,000 rotations per

20
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:17,470
minute to 10,000 rotations per minute, and even beyond that.

21
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:22,580
So that part of the magnetic disk speed has been improving. So this type of

22
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,670
improvement requires improvement in what material is

23
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,966
the platter built out of. Another factor that

24
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:33,050
has been affecting this is the noise.

25
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,180
Disks that rotate faster, tend to both noisier

26
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,000
and also create a higher a pitch sound,

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,690
which is less pleasant for people. And this

28
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,066
type of improvement is also relatively slow. And

29
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:49,090
the speed of this controllers, and the buses over

30
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,898
which we transfer data has been improving at an

31
00:01:51,898 --> 00:01:56,150
okay rate. So really the controller and the bus

32
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,480
are becoming a smaller and smaller fraction of

33
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,680
the overall disk access time. So the disk access

34
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,264
time is pretty much dominated by the seek time

35
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:09,300
and to a lesser extent now, the rotational latency.

36
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,070
And now you can see why disks have been lagging in improving their

37
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,230
latency relative to memory and processors. This

38
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,010
is because seek time requires better mechanics,

39
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,240
and rotational latency also requires better materials

40
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,650
and better mechanical properties. Both of which

41
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,780
are not really subject to something like Moore's Law that we get for processors.
