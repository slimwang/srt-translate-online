1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,780
I do go to Home Depot, I actually
have the credit card because I buy

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,780
things that I need around the house.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,820
I have lot of iDevices and
have done business with Apple.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,312
I held insurance at Georgia Tech,

5
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:17,100
a BlueCross Blue Shield at
parent company at this Anthem.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,960
I'm sure I have or some family member
of mine has shopped at Target.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,890
I have shipped packages at UPS.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,630
So for me, it's at least five.

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,590
I'm sure many of you have Facebook,
Twitter accounts and things like that.

10
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,560
So, it's not just the data
that lives on our computers.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,610
But it's the data that
lives on the computers of

12
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,770
businesses that we patronize.

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,180
And our data could actually be
breached from those companies.

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,090
And then we could become targets, or

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,880
harm can come our way
from malicious actors.
