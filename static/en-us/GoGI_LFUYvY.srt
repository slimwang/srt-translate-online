00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Evans] The answer is there are 41 different positions for the first wheel,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and we multiply that by 31 different positions for the second K wheel.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And so that means that every 1271 letters those wheels would repeat,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and there are only 1271 different possible settings for the K wheels.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Remember that based on the intercepted messages

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
they had learned enough about the structure of the machine

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
to know what the bits are around these wheels.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So it's only necessary to figure out the right configuration.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So certainly today, being able to try 1200-some possibilities

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
would be trivial with a modern computer,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and you might wonder why when they encountered this at Bletchley Park

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
they didn't just go down to the store and buy a computer to solve it,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
but this was 1941. Computers didn't exist yet. They had to invent one first.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And in fact, arguably, the first computer was invented to solve exactly this problem.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Before we get to that, I want to make sure that we actually have enough of an advantage here

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
that trying these configurations will help.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So let's look at the probability that if we guess the right key

18
00:01:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we'll be able to tell that we got the right message.
