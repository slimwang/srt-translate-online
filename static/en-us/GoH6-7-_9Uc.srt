1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,250
So far, we've uploaded
a photo to Firebase Storage.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,429
Next we need to add functionality
to handle adding photo messages to

3
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:08,589
the database, so

4
00:00:08,589 --> 00:00:11,919
that other people chatting in
Friendly Chat can see the photo.

5
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:14,820
We've already done part of the work
by saving the photo's path,

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,179
the URL,
as part of a message in the database.

7
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:21,469
This creates an entry in the messages
part of the database that has

8
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:25,559
a key value pair for the image URL, and
a key value pair for the display name.

9
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,309
But, unlike text messages,

10
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:31,529
these photo messages do not
include a key value pair for text.

11
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:36,119
This causes a problem when I want to
see a photo message appear in the app.

12
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,259
Currently the table code is implemented
to find values for the key name and

13
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:41,750
text.

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,859
Hence our problem, it's not looking for
the image URL for our photo messages.

15
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:50,719
There's one other thing I
want to mention about this URL.

16
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,909
It's really important that we're only
storing the URL here in the database,

17
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:57,129
because we don't want the database
to be bogged down with large files.

18
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:00,820
By having the URL here,
which is just a string,

19
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,540
we can recreate the image
using that URL in our app.

20
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:06,929
All right, enough talk.

21
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,120
Let's modify our tableView code,
so it can display photo messages
