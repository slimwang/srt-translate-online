1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,080
It's starting to look like we
actually got some work done, right?

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,220
I told you all the Gulp
work would pay off.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,039
In fact, I have a final piece that would
make a lot more sense now that we have

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,100
our first task written down.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,900
Gulp comes with a killer
feature called watch.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,726
Think of it as an automatic trigger
that waits for something to change.

7
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:22,620
Previously I needed to notify James
every time I wanted him to do some task.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,770
Now I can rely on the watcher
doing it automatically.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,960
Consider what you currently have to do.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,200
If you make any changes to
your sas file right you

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,020
need to switch to the terminal,
re enter gob styles, execute it,

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,300
switch to the browser and reload.

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,670
A proper watcher lets you never
switch to terminal again.
