00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,236
We use scientific notation to write extremely large numbers or small numbers,

2
00:00:04,236 --> 00:00:08,326
let's review that real quick. At the beach, we could think about measuring a

3
00:00:08,326 --> 00:00:12,509
tiny grain of sand, that grain would measure this many meters. We can rewrite

4
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,550
this number in scientific notation, using what we learned from Unit 1. For

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,905
scientific notation, the absolute value of our first number, a, must be greater

6
00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:25,524
than or equal to 1, and less than 10. So we know we need to move the decimal to

7
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:29,976
the 6. We'll have 6 and 25 hundredths. Next, we need a power of 10 so we can

8
00:00:29,976 --> 00:00:34,914
move this decimal back to its original position. I know this decimal should move

9
00:00:34,914 --> 00:00:39,104
five places to the left in order to get this number. So my exponent is negative

10
00:00:39,104 --> 00:00:43,124
5. We learned about negative exponents at the beginning of this unit and this

11
00:00:43,124 --> 00:00:47,095
should make a ton of sense now. Multiplying by a negative power of ten makes a

12
00:00:47,095 --> 00:00:51,166
number smaller because we're really dividing the number by a power of 10. And,

13
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:55,198
if we carried out the math and moved the 10 to the denominator and then divided

14
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,238
by 100,000 we would get this decimal. And, remember a positive exponent would

15
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:03,055
make sense here. Positive powers of ten make numbers larger but this one's

16
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:03,551
smaller.
