00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,367
We know that the solutions to these two inequalities will each be intervals of

2
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:08,529
values of x. Which if we think about these graphs is going to correspond to

3
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:13,114
selecting certain portions of each of these curves. The points that lie in those

4
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:17,875
regions that are selected will have x coordinates that satisfy The corresponding

5
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:22,420
inequality. So for each of these inequalities, I'd like to tell you whether

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,893
solutions can be found above the purple line in either graph, or below it, or

7
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:29,984
maybe both or it maybe neither, you pick. You pick.
