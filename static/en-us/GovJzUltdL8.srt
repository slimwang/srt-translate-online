00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
So I've left the most interesting and challenging part of this for you to

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,460
finish as a quiz, and that's how to compute the new rank based on the values

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,710
of the previous iteration, which are now stored in the variable ranks.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,000
We want to up compute the new rank based on all the pages that link to this one,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,369
and if you think about the graph structure and how to go through the

6
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:21,448
nodes in the graph,

7
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:22,800
I think you can figure out how to do this.
