00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,828
The trick is to change these numbers over here

2
00:00:02,828 --> 00:00:05,772
to numbers that trigger once in a decade and

3
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:08,768
this is as simple as changing the 1.96 to 6.5

4
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:11,405
which is really kind of a minor change, but this

5
00:00:11,405 --> 00:00:13,196
makes all the difference. The percentage now

6
00:00:13,196 --> 00:00:16,645
becomes so small, you get one trigger per decade.

7
00:00:16,646 --> 00:00:18,365
So letâ€™s quickly compute what the numbers look

8
00:00:18,365 --> 00:00:21,000
like for 6.5.
