00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,182
A pinhole camera captures an image upside down. In computer graphics we think of

2
00:00:04,182 --> 00:00:08,047
a camera a bit differently with the image being formed in front of the viewer.

3
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:11,492
This is a more convenient way to consider the task of image generation. For

4
00:00:11,492 --> 00:00:15,242
starters, now the object projects onto our screen right side up. This

5
00:00:15,242 --> 00:00:19,246
pyramid-shaped view of the world is called the view frustum. Frustum means a

6
00:00:19,246 --> 00:00:23,528
pyramid with its top chopped off. It is one of the most frequently misspelled

7
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:27,882
words in computer graphics. So, lock it in your brain now. There's no letter r

8
00:00:27,882 --> 00:00:31,862
in the last half of that word. I suspect it sneaks in there because of the r in

9
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:35,850
the word frustrate or maybe the word fulcrum. Anyway, enough about that. The

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,304
point here is that we want to know how much light is coming from each direction.

11
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:43,165
Each light emits photons which bounce around the world and may get absorbed or

12
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:47,083
otherwise changed. In a camera we gather photons from the world and these create

13
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:50,876
a photograph. In computer graphics, we simulate the real world as best we can

14
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:54,670
and try to determine how many photons are coming in each direction. Whatever

15
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,553
amount of light we gather from a direction, we record at a pixel in the screen.
