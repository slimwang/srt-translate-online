1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,180
Okay, let's take a quick look at
the triggers and the variables.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,340
You should also have variables for
each kind of food preference, fish,

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,860
meat, vegan, vegetarian.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,678
If we look at fish one,
configure the variable value to

5
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:18,410
be a relevant daily special for
the food preference.

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,850
And trigger it on the appropriate
trigger, in this case the fish trigger.

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,230
Now there's several ways
to handle the situation

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,680
where the user does not
specify a food preference.

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:33,830
You can let it default to the English
special, since we already have it.

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:39,010
Or you can create a new trigger,
such as no food pref trigger, and

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,900
set it to fire when

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:47,540
the food pref contains unrestricted,
because that's what we set in our code.

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,250
Save Trigger.

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,724
Now that you've got that trigger,
you can either create a new variable,

15
00:00:52,724 --> 00:00:56,190
especially for
People who don't specify a preference,

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,820
if you want to give them their
very own customized special.

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,628
Or you could just pick one
of the other specials,

18
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:05,025
I'm going to o for
the vegetarian special,

19
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:08,740
and show that one to the people
who don't specify a preference.

20
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,920
And the way you do that is just edit the
variable and add another custom trigger.

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,860
So we want this to trigger, not only
when the vegetarian trigger applies, but

22
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,590
when the no food pref trigger applies.

23
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,210
Save the variable, and there it is.

24
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,650
And it really doesn't matter
which way you decide to go.
