1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,960
So let me take you back into what we

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,690
were talking about last time. We were talking about

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,710
the iterated prisoners dilemma, and here's the prisoners dilemma

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,440
payoffs that you wrote down for us. You remember this?

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,660
>> I vaguely remember this.

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:17,860
>> And remember it was about these two criminals, Smooth and Curly. And they

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,250
were, deciding whether to cooperate or defect

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,660
against each other when, after they've been arrested.

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,180
>> Right, and they defect, they always defect. They always

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,630
defect, right. So in particular, we say well what happens if it's, if they have

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:33,340
multiple rounds in which to interact, and so here they are, here are the two

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,240
of them, and if they've got one round to live, we did an analysis and

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,730
we indicated that there's really nothing they

14
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,730
can do other than defect against each other.

15
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:40,283
>> Mm-hm.

16
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:42,480
>> It's irrational to do anything else.

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:42,690
>> Yep.

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,110
>> So we said, all right, well, what happens if we allow

19
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,450
there to be more than one round? So now we've got two rounds.

20
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,540
And what we realized was that if you got

21
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,395
two rounds to go, then these players essentially, face a

22
00:00:55,395 --> 00:00:59,050
one-round game because, after this round, what they're going to do

23
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,770
in the last round has already been determined. So it's

24
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,700
almost as if that round doesn't really matter. There's nothing

25
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,740
we can do now that's going to change what they're going

26
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,880
to do in that last round, so it's sort of

27
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,950
like there's just one round and we're going to defect again.

28
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,870
>> Right, so life is terrible and everyone is out to get everyone else.

29
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,900
>> Exactly, and

30
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,130
not only is it for two rounds, but this

31
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,630
same argument continues as you go three rounds or more.

32
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,750
>> Oh, it's like a proof by induction.

33
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,650
>> It's kind of like a proof by induction, yeah, well it's proof by ellipsis.

34
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,135
>> Mm, that's my favorite kind of induction. Proof by ellipsis.

35
00:01:29,135 --> 00:01:33,010
>> [LAUGH] So the question then becomes, what

36
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,320
happens if the, number of rounds left is unknown,

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,020
right? So what we've realized is that if

38
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,450
you know how many rounds are left, the whole

39
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,230
thing comes unraveled and they're just going to defect forever. But we raised

40
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,200
the issue of, what happens if the number of rounds left is unknown?

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,420
>> Hm.

42
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,170
>> And it seems like it shouldn't really make any

43
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,410
difference because if it's say some finite number we just

44
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,340
don't know what it is, then it seems like it

45
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,970
should still reduce to this same setup that we have.

46
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,850
So I was looking into this and it turns out

47
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,760
that is it's not the case it actually does make

48
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,040
a difference and it's, it's really interesting how it goes

49
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,930
and how it connects back with other things we've talked about.

50
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,720
>> Woo, tell me more.
