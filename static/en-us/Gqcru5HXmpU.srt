00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,320
MATLAB has a couple of ways of thinking about how to do this, right?

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,890
And we're going to use, again, old MATLAB nomenclature, and

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,430
then I'll tell you about the new one.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,080
So there are a couple of different methods.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,540
The first method is called clip.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,820
Clip basically means I assume that that outside boundary is black.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,730
I then apply my filter, so here I can see my filter.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,170
And when I pull out the image,

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,850
you can notice that this thing has gotten kind of dark at the edges.

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,770
And that makes sense because that black has leaked in, all right.

11
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,610
But that’s referred to as clipping.

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,420
Another method is called wrap around.

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,890
It’s kind of a weird method.

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,660
It has to do with some Fourier analysis that we’ll talk about later.

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,110
Basically it says that I assume my picture continues and wraps around.

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,180
Which means that you see this stuff filled in here?

17
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,560
That's the stuff that comes from this side of the picture.

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,970
It's easier to see up here, right?

19
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,030
These, these red peppers came from down here.

20
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,240
And the, the yellow straw comes from over there.

21
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,910
All right?

22
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,130
And that was under assumption that what you were actually looking at

23
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,480
was a periodic signal.

24
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,810
So if you were looking at a periodic signal.

25
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,150
The next thing that would happen would be the stuff that was at the start of it.

26
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,200
Well, in filtering, in image filtering, that doesn't work so well.

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,330
Here, I'm going to apply the filter, and

28
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,810
then I'm going to cut back to the original size image.

29
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,060
And you'll notice that there's some red stuff here.

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,400
Where did that red stuff come from?

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,040
Well, it actually came from the bottom because it got wrapped around.

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,864
There is a method that's called copy edge or

33
00:01:29,864 --> 00:01:34,361
replicate where you just basically extend out, right?

34
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,630
So I just extend out the same value.

35
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,508
And then I run my filter and then I pull out my picture and

36
00:01:41,508 --> 00:01:44,040
that's reasonable, okay?

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,760
The replicate method is a, is an easy one, and it gives you a reasonable result.

38
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,470
It basically says that the image sort of stays the same.

39
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,900
Now the problem is is that the statistics, of course, are different, right?

40
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,230
Because you had this nice varying image, and

41
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,370
then you make everything be sort of the same going out.

42
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,980
So, another method is called reflection.

43
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,120
Okay, are sometimes called symmetric.

44
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,410
And what that does is you, you reflect the image out.

45
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,940
And here, I just did that.

46
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,250
In fact, here let me draw right here.

47
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,400
Here's the reflected edge.

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,820
It's actually, if I erase it, hard to see that edge.

49
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,420
Right? Because I basically re, I, I take the image and I fold it back out again.

50
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,640
All right.

51
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,510
So, then I take that.

52
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,940
I apply my filter.

53
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,410
And then I pull out the image, and it actually does a pretty good job.

54
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,350
So, often you either want to do what's called replicate, or

55
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,000
copy, the edge or reflect across the image.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,700
In new MATLAB these are expressed using this function called imfilter,

57
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,910
which comes from the Image Processing Toolbox.

58
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,670
And you can do you put in a value.

59
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,520
Puts that value in, so we put in 0, it's like clipping.

60
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,450
You can wrap around with circular and

61
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,290
then the copy edge is replicate and reflection is symmetric.

62
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,150
And typically, you'll use either replicate or symmetric.
