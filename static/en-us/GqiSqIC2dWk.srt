1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,280
We can start addressing these kind of
issues by practicing adaptive design.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,189
Let's start by talking about
the when of adaptive design.

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,220
Or, at what points do you want
to begin adapting your UI?

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,410
The basic idea of adaptive design
is that you change your UI,

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,850
based on the screen size.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,770
That is, your UI adapts to
the amount of horizontal or

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,810
vertical space that you have.

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,690
We do this by introducing
what we call break points.

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,500
Break points are the points
at which your UI changes.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,280
For example, you could show another
column of content once your screen width

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,850
is 600 dp or larger.

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,870
600 dp is therefore
a break point in your UI.

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,160
Now you might be wondering,
how should I choose these break points?

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,590
Well, the material spec identifies
some common breakpoints.

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,870
While you can start with these,

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,590
it's important to ensure your
breakpoints make sense for your content.

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,020
It's important to think content first.

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,520
You can then think of the breakpoints
as the point in which your UI

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,170
literally breaks for
the content it's trying to present.

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,060
So what does it mean
to be content versed?

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,410
In this case, it means starting by
figuring out what the constraints

22
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,150
are for your content, and then figuring
out the break points from there.

23
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,560
Let's return to some of the layouts
we looked at in lesson one and

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,670
see how they might
work on larger devices.

25
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,910
Now, as the screen width
increases with this layout

26
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,760
The line length the text increases
is making harder to read.

27
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,480
So, you might want to have
a break point somewhere

28
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,230
where the line length exceeds
45 to 75 character guideline.

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,720
In this form layout,

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,470
on wider devices there's too much
unused space, here on the right.

31
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,500
Making it feel unbalanced.

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,490
You might set a break point round about
say here to re balance the layout.

33
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,990
In this example,

34
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,710
see how these two buttons take
up half the width of the screen.

35
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,870
On wider layouts,

36
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,820
this starts to get quite awkward,
around about say this point.

37
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,760
So that might be a break point.

38
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,700
Also notice how maintaining
a constant height and

39
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,150
center crop image starts to
break down on larger sizes.

40
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,810
It ends up showing this kind of small
sliver of the whole image greatly

41
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,958
blown up.

42
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:12,330
Lastly, the left-align
content can start to feel

43
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,180
unbalanced leaving large empty
areas on the right of the screen.

44
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,060
Choosing break points based
on content requirements

45
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,580
is more future proof than basing
them on a specific set of devices.

46
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,255
You'll know those requirements
will be satisfied no matter

47
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:27,745
what devices get thrown your way.

48
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:29,605
Okay.
So

49
00:02:29,605 --> 00:02:32,675
now that we know that we want to do
something different when a UI gets to

50
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:34,205
these break point sizes,

51
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:37,345
in the next section we'll talk
about how you do this with code.
