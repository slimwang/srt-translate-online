A equals y-bar minus 0.2 times x-bar. Y-bar is 680.35 and then we subtract 0.2

2
00:00:09,249 --> 00:00:18,646
times x-bar, 2601.11, and we get 160.13. Now we can plug this value in to our

3
00:00:18,646 --> 00:00:23,232
general equation for the line. And now we can use this equation to make

00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:26,164
predictions and answer other questions.
