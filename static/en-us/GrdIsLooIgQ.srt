00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:04,670
And the answer is no. These functions are actually not inverses of one another.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,018
It might look like they are right off the bat since we've been talking about

3
00:00:08,018 --> 00:00:13,126
how inverse functions undo what the other one does. However, these operations

4
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:18,920
performed by f and g are not actually opposites. F divides x by 4, but g of x

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,134
divides 4 by x. We can tell by taking their composites that they are definitely

6
00:00:24,134 --> 00:00:27,863
not inverses of one another. They're definitely not undoing each other's

7
00:00:27,863 --> 00:00:33,378
operations. If we take f of g of x, we end up with 1 over x. And if we take g

8
00:00:33,378 --> 00:00:39,263
of f of x, we get 16 over x. Hm, I wonder what the inverses of these functions

9
00:00:39,263 --> 00:00:40,199
are, then?
