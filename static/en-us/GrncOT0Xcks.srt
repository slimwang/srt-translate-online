1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,700
I wanted to spend a moment talking about individual use cases.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,230
Individual use cases are extremely valuable in understanding

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,150
expected user behavior.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,710
They're also used in, in the development shops that

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,160
use agile methods in doing some of their planning and scheduling.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:26,460
What it essentially is is a story illustrating a specific act,

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,520
interaction between a user and a system.

8
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,290
I've listed here a story about buying from Amazon.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,144
It's written out as just narrative text.

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,300
And there's no structure to it, but nevertheless,

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,330
it's a way of expressing, in a very user centered form, a system requirement.

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:52,760
We could take this same story and also express it in a structured way.

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,509
Here in tabular form is the same story, in particular there are three columns,.

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,490
The column on the left is the actor, okay?

15
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:08,490
And there are two actors here, the user and the Amazon website.

16
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,350
There are various actions that could take place.

17
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,320
And sometimes, optionally,

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,560
there are objects, okay, that are used by the actor to perform the action, or

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,170
produced by the action, and those are in the right-most column.
