1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,830
Right now, our app has all
the functionality that it needs.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,860
It just doesn't look very pretty.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,300
So, I'm going to be walking you
through how to make those changes.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,350
So, the first thing we're going to do is
modify something called the Styles file.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:18,230
And that's located in Values, and
then it's right here, this styles.xml.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,390
So, I'm going to double-click.

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,160
Okay, now this is a file that
you've never really touched before.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,120
And I'm not going to go into
the details of exactly how this works.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,520
We've provided you with some code, which
will change your buttons to orange and

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,810
also change your action bar to orange.

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,090
And this code will do that because
the Styles file is responsible for

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,545
controlling the basic
default styles of your app.

13
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:41,005
Whereas right now in our XML,
if we wanted to change the color of

14
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:44,450
a background, we would do it for
each element.

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,100
But if you do it in the styles file,
it will do it for the entire layout.

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,950
Okay, so I'm going to paste
the code that I gave you over.

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,000
This color primary here is the color
that the action bar will be.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,800
And this color button normal is
the color that your buttons will be.

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,750
Now a quick note.

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,650
Because of API updates,
this colorButtonNormal tag will actually

21
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,360
only work if you have API level 22 and
above.

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,770
So, what this means is that
if you have a newer phone,

23
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,770
you will see the orange buttons, and
you can check it out in the emulator.

24
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,680
And if your phone's a little bit older,
you'll still see gray buttons.

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,420
Now, there are ways to get around this,
but

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,980
I don't want us to get too caught up in
the weeds of how to color our buttons.

27
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,480
Okay, let's go back to
our activity_main.xml.

28
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,040
Okay, cool.

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,830
So we can see now that it actually
updated to show that our buttons

30
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,780
are orange, and
our action bar is also orange.

31
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,950
Our status bar also became a light gray,
which is due to us changing this parent

32
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,430
attribute right here to AppCompat.Light
instead of AppCompat.Dark.

33
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,550
It gave us a light theming
instead of a dark theming.

34
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,630
Okay, let me go back to the XML.

35
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,360
So, the next thing on our list is
to make a nice little divider bar

36
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,890
right here.

37
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,690
Okay, so if I click on this
linear layout right here,

38
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,250
we can see that it's sort of
this view that lives here.

39
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,640
If I scroll down a little bit,
I'll see the other linear layout,

40
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,130
when I click on it,
is this linear layout right here.

41
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,910
So if I wanted a bar in between the two,
I would put it right here, after which

42
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,780
the first linear layout closes, and
before the second linear layout opens.

43
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,870
And because the parents of both
of these two linear layouts

44
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,430
is another linear layout,
I'll scroll up to show you.

45
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,480
This linear layout right here.

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,320
Which has an orientation of horizontal.

47
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,190
When I put the bar right here,
it's going to show this linear layout,

48
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,430
the bar, then this linear layout,
all in a horizontal row.

49
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,280
Okay, let me go down.

50
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,135
If you just want to make a colored
square, which is essentially what a line

51
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:44,767
is that runs down the center here,
we can use a view called, well, View.

52
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:47,590
Okay.

53
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,210
Now, just like other views,
this view needs a width and a height.

54
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,300
Now, we want a thin line, so
the width of this view should be one DP.

55
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,320
This is what the thickness
of the line is going to be.

56
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,110
And what I want is for

57
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,330
this line to be just as tall
as all the text in the buttons

58
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,610
in the linear layout for Team A,
and the linear layout for Team B.

59
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,870
So, I'm going to make
the height match parent.

60
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,480
Now, this view is basically a box
that has one DP in width, and

61
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,220
has the height of the parent
linear layout of all of this.

62
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,790
But we can't see it because
the background color is white.

63
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,230
So, I'm going to change
the background color to dark gray.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,570
Okay, so now we have a dark gray
line that's going down the center of

65
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,700
the screen.

66
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,870
But, if we zoom in,
we'll see that it's actually

67
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:41,690
going down the entire center of the
screen, even through the reset button.

68
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,740
And we actually want it
to stop right about here.

69
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,827
So the way that we're going to do that
is we're going to start telling things

70
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:52,180
to wrap content instead of match parent.

71
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,570
Specifically, for the Team A and Team B
linear layouts, instead of having their

72
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,720
height being the entire screen,
we're going to have it wrap content for

73
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,500
both of these, so that the layouts will
end right at the bottom of the buttons.

74
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,450
And then, for the parent layout,
the horizontal layout that's

75
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,380
laying out all of this,
we'll also tell it to wrap content.

76
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,940
Which will wrap the content up tight
against the bottom of the team B and

77
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,510
team A linear layouts.

78
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,529
And that should make the line the same
height as both of these layouts.

79
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,269
So, let's make those changes.

80
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,280
I'll start with this
linear layout right here,

81
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,350
which is the linear layout for team B.

82
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,430
And I'm going to change its
height to wrap_content.

83
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,180
Okay, good, it's wrapping the content
of the buttons right now.

84
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,634
I'm going to click on the Team A layout
and I'm also going to change its

85
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:40,040
layout_height, instead of
match_parent to wrap_content.

86
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,750
So now both of these layouts here are
wrapping the content of their children.

87
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,430
But the line down the middle is
still extending towards the bottom.

88
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,390
And that's because the parent of these
two linear layouts is still taking up

89
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,090
all this space,

90
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,430
because it has a height of match_parent,
which is the entire screen.

91
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,177
So now, I'm going to tell this,
as well, to wrap_content.

92
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,100
So now the gray line ends here at the
bottom of both of these linear layouts.

93
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,410
Okay, cool.
Now,

94
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,100
I didn't want the gray line to
extend all the way up here, but

95
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,320
that's an issue that can be resolved
with padding and layout margins, so

96
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,010
we'll do that in a little bit.

97
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,970
Right now what I want to
do is go through and

98
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,080
get all the appropriate text sizes,
colors and the correct fonts.

99
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,961
So, we're going to just start at
the top and make those changes.

100
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:26,476
What I've been told for
this first TextView

101
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:31,227
is that it's going to have a font
family of Sans Serif Medium.

102
00:05:31,227 --> 00:05:33,575
And it's going to have
a text size of 14sp.

103
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,400
And finally, also that its text color
is going to be the hex code 616161,

104
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,510
which is a nice light gray text color,
okay.

105
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,140
So that's the font, the size, and
the color for this team A text view.

106
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,590
I'm going to move on
to the team A score.

107
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,330
Now, for the score, the font family
is going to be Sans Serif light.

108
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:02,750
The text size is going to be a large
56sp, so that our score is nice and big.

109
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,340
And the textColor is
actually going to be black,

110
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,590
which in hex is represented as 000000.

111
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,140
Okay, cool.

112
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,670
I'm going to zoom out.

113
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,270
So, for our buttons, we actually don't
change anything about the text styling

114
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,650
or text size or text color.

115
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,970
These are fine.

116
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,630
But I do want to change
the other side and

117
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,610
I change it exactly as I
change the first side.

118
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,760
So, let me do that really quickly.

119
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,660
Okay.
So I just updated so

120
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,990
that these two are exactly the same now.

121
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,550
And our text sizes,

122
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,620
text sizes, colors, and
font families are looking pretty good.

123
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,156
So really,

124
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:37,271
the only thing left is to work on
the spacing issues that I'm seeing.

125
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,359
Okay, we'll start with
the first text view here.

126
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:45,653
Instead of a padding of 4dp, we're
going to change it a padding of 16dp.

127
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:50,033
Now here in the score text view,
instead of a padding of 4dp,

128
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:53,758
we're going to change it
to padding bottom of 24dp.

129
00:06:53,758 --> 00:06:56,130
And that's because with
the 16dp padding here,

130
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,440
We already have enough room
between these two lines of text.

131
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,430
Okay, now for the buttons.

132
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,548
Now, our buttons are looking
a little bit wide.

133
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,290
I don't want to give them
a specific width, but

134
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,460
I do want them to be a little
bit farther away from the edges.

135
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,330
Now, we can't use padding,
because remember,

136
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,010
padding is space added inside the view,
and

137
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,970
button views have a background color
that extends throughout the view.

138
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,230
So we're going to be using margin, here.

139
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,390
Now, right now,
I have a layout margin of 8.

140
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:26,500
But what I'm going to do is change
this to a layout margin bottom of 8.

141
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:32,360
And then a margin left and right of 24,
which will keep the same spacing,

142
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,090
vertically, but
will push in the sides of the button.

143
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,960
So let's do that now.

144
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,440
Okay, so that button's
looking a little bit better.

145
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,470
I'm going to do the same thing
to the other two buttons here.

146
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,530
And I'm actually copying and
pasting to do this.

147
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,390
All right, cool.

148
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,820
Now, I don't want to bore you, so

149
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,880
I'm just going to make the same changes
to this side that I just made to Team A.

150
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,930
So, give me one second.

151
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,500
Okay, great.

152
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,973
Now my two sides look the same.

153
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:57,990
The only other real margin that I
have to deal with is the margin for

154
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,920
this grey line here, and
the margin for the reset button.

155
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,370
Let's do the reset button first.

156
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:08,260
Okay, so i'm going to give the reset
button a bottom margin of 8dp, and

157
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,820
i'm going to give it a left
a right margin of 22dp.

158
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,460
Okay, now I'm going to
scroll up to the grey line.

159
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,810
Okay, that's this view right here.

160
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,400
And basically,

161
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,142
I don't want the grey line to be
touching the app bar right here.

162
00:08:20,142 --> 00:08:22,270
I want to give it a little bit of space.

163
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,010
And I'm going to be using
margin instead of padding for

164
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,960
the same reasons that
I did on the button.

165
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,730
Because this is a gray background, so

166
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,960
any padding that I use actually is
not going to really change anything.

167
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,630
But margin,
which is space around the view, will.

168
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,400
So let's do that right now.

169
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,250
Margin top, and we'll do 16dp.

170
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,640
Yeah, there we go.

171
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,179
There's a little space
above the gray line there.

172
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:48,630
Okay, now my code's looking a little bit
sloppy because I was just kind of adding

173
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,240
attributes willy nilly.

174
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,940
So I'm going to do a Cmd+A.

175
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,020
Or if you're on a Windows
device a Ctrl+A to select all.

176
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,420
And then I'm going to do a Cmd+Option+L.

177
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,210
And if you're on a Windows device,
that's a Ctrl+Alt+L.

178
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,340
And that will automatically
reformat the code for me.

179
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,150
It'll look really nice and pretty.

180
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,970
Just as pretty as our
new Court Counter app.

181
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,480
Now, I kind of want to
see this on my phone,

182
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,450
so I'm going to load up my phone right
now with this newly skinned app.

183
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,410
Remember, if you have an older phone,

184
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,660
it's going to show the buttons
as a different color.

185
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,000
But you can always use the emulator.

186
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,980
Woo hoo!
What a stylish looking app.

187
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,920
Now the question is.

188
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,810
Is it still working?

189
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,660
Well, I didn't touch any
of the Java code, so yeah.

190
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,020
And the scores are nice and big now.

191
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,990
And I've got these wonderful colors for
my buttons.

192
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,600
Awesome work.
