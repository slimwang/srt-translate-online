00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,590
Let me give you an example of how your time bank

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,430
might work. Let's say, I'm looking for someone to fix my

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,390
bike. Well, by teaching design to other time bank members, I've

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,400
accumulated a credit of hours. I look, and I find Jane, who

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,390
is an excellent bike repair person, and I invite her to

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,890
my project. We agree on the job. The work is completed

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,200
and the bike is now running great. And so, we make

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,140
the transfer of hours which have been deducted from my account and

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:26,820
added to Jane's.

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,560
I'll bet some of you are already thinking

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,070
about how this works as a system. Well, there's

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,620
my screen, and then there's Jane's screen. And then,

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,170
there's some administrator at the bank. Even though this

14
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,520
is a more complex system. For this project, to

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,360
make it simple, we're just going to focus on a

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,240
single person's user interface and experience. What your screens

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,040
would look like, if you were using the bank.
