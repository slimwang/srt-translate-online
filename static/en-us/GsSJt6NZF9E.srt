00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For this question, I'm going to introduce a new mode of operation,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
which is very similar to cipher feedback mode.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is the way cipher feedback mode worked.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The change for output feedback mode

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
is instead of taking the cipher text

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and putting that back into the x vector,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
we're going to take the output from the encryption

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and take that, so that's the only difference between

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
cipher feedback mode and output feedback mode.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Which of the following are true?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Output feedback mode provides stronger protection against tampering

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
than is possible with CFB.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Unlike CFB, with OFB it's possible to recover most of an encrypted file,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
even if one of the blocks in the encrypted file is lost.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Like CFB, it could be the basis of a cryptographic hash function using OFB.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And finally, it would be safe to use 0 as the initialization vector for OFB.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Which of the following 4 statements are true?
