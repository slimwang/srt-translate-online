1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,330
To create the histogram, we'll pass friend count to x

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,100
inside of hue plot, and we'll pass pf into data.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,370
When I run the code, I can get my histogram. Looking

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,670
at the plot, we can see that the data is squished on

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,680
the left side of the graph, just like Maura's plot, and

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,280
this graph extends all the way to the 5000 mark. This is

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,670
what we call long tail data. And this data can be

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,380
common for some user-level data. Most users have friend counts under 500,

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,380
so we get really tall bins on the left. But there are

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,540
a few users in our dataset with really high values. The higher

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,980
values are closer to 5,000, which is the maximum

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,510
number of friends a user can have. Moore was interested

13
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,020
in examining the bulk of her data. And, it's the

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,610
same for us. While, we may want to investigate some

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,920
observations in this tail, we really want to examine our

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,160
users with friend counts well below 1,000. All of these

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,420
people here. To do that, we'll need to learn something

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,700
else, in order to adjust our code, and our plot.
