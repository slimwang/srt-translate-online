Athena is ready to keep pushing forward with her understanding of acoustics to

2
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:08,378
help out with Concert Hall design. As before, she's still pretty concerned with

3
00:00:08,378 --> 00:00:12,018
how well audience members will be able to hear the music from different places

4
00:00:12,018 --> 00:00:17,892
in the concert hall. Now, however, she's worried about Reverberation time. This

5
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:22,276
is basically how long a sound echoes for after it's been produced. Athena has

6
00:00:22,276 --> 00:00:26,535
figured out a simplified equation for reverberation time in the hall. The

7
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:34,250
equation is, T equals 0.322 V over A. Here, T stands for Reverberation time, V

8
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:39,938
is the volume of the hall, and A is the surface area of the hall. So, to figure

9
00:00:39,938 --> 00:00:43,708
out the reverberation time then, Athena is going to need to find the volume and

10
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:49,172
the surface area of the room. On this diagram of the hall, I've written in the

11
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:53,648
dimensions of each of the sides. It's not super important right now what x

12
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:58,724
stands for but just so you know, it's the depth of the stage back here. This is

13
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:03,185
how long x is. Considering each of these lengths, what is the volume of our

14
00:01:03,185 --> 00:01:04,688
concert hall?
