00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,360
Some tools are built into the device,
as you saw, but

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,480
others work by monitoring your
device during normal use,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,270
these are generally available
through Android Studio.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,190
For example, consider Memory Monitor.

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,850
Memory Monitor works by tracking how
much memory is currently allocated, and

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,410
can be a great way to see how specific
actions or events can affect your heap.

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,500
Here we have Sunshine, and

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,900
you can see how several events
claimed additional memory.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,080
These were clicks from the list view
to the detail view and back, and

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,710
required memory for
the detail fragments.

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,970
And here was a change in the location
setting, which sparked a new sync for

12
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,610
new weather data.

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,270
You can also see when garbage
collection events occur,

14
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,630
as the free space increases
when this memory is reclaimed.
