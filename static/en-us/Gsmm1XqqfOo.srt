1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,067
Ideally, we want to draw the blue object first, then the red, then the green.

2
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:08,546
The yellow filter is behind the blue object and should have no effect. For this

3
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:11,606
first answer, since we aren't given the alpha values of the green and red

4
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:15,796
filters, we don't know how this affects our draw order. The red or green object

5
00:00:15,796 --> 00:00:21,500
may draw first. We can also rule out this last answer for the same reason. We

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,340
don't know the intensity or even how intensity is defined so we can't use this

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,598
as a way to solve the problem. The second answer works well for the green and

8
00:00:29,598 --> 00:00:34,102
red filter, but falls apart on the yellow filter. With the z-buffer off, the

9
00:00:34,102 --> 00:00:38,160
yellow filter would be drawn on top of the blue object filtering it. This is

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,320
clearly incorrect. This leaves the third answer, which is correct. This answer

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,848
is similar to the second answer and that the Painter's algorithm also sorts

12
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:51,820
objects from back to front. However, this time, with the z-buffer on, the yellow

13
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,052
filter is properly hidden by the blue object. The red filter is rendered next

14
00:00:57,052 --> 00:00:59,993
and blended, then the green is added in on top.
