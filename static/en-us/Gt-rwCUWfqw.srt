1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's take up this target business model and customer development

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but you know before we even begin one of the first questions I tend to ask is what is a company?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What is it that I'm trying to actually start?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Just for the sake this class, I think we ought to just use this definition.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A company is a business organization

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
with sales, a product, or service in exchange for revenue and profit.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So explicitly for the purpose of this class, I'm eliminating nonprofits.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let me be clear, you could use the business model canvas and customer development

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to go through the process for nonprofit but actually having some goals that are fairly concrete revenue

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and profit allows us to measure whether we're succeeding and failing in very clear ways

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and then we adjust to the question. What's a startup?

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It tells use where the company is but how does a startup different,

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and for me you have know I spent 20 years doing eight startups

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and I never could have given you a definition on the top my head what a startup is.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I always thought a startup is where we have free food.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Where there is a great small team or you could bring your dog and whatever,

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but I never quite understood the purpose of a startup.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So I'm going to give you Steve's definition of what it is your actually doing.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
A startup is a temporary organization design to

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
search for a repeatable and scalable business model.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Now let's go back and parts the sentence because this is pretty important.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Number one is temporary. The goal of a startup is not to be startup.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
A startup actually aims to bring you company.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well that's kind of interesting because if you really think about it at least if you're a web mobile startup

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
there is no such thing as a ten year old startup.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There's a two year old startup attached to an eight year old failure.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
A start up is a temporary organization and what are you suppose to be doing?

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, while you think it might be built on the product or maybe if your thinking harder

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
it might be get customers, actually no.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
A startup is actually design to search person. Well that' kind of interesting.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What is it that I'm suppose to be searching for? Let see.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well number one, you want to search for something that's repeatable

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and repeatable means the same thing that works on Monday, works on Wednesday,

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and works on Friday, and works next week, and works the next month.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That is I want to find sales and ,marketing, and engineering processes that are repeatable.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I also want to find them scalable.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What scalable means, I put a dollar in, I get two dollars out,

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
or I put a dollar in and maybe I get ten dollars out.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But I better not be loosing money on a continual basis or I'm called an out of business startup.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, I know I'm searching for something repeatable and scalable but

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
what is it that I'm searching for?

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What you're searching for is the business model

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and that business model search is the basis of the rest of the class.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's take a look and see how we become okay.
