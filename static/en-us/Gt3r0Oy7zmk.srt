1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,540
We talked about these different methods,
something you know,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,030
something you have,
those are called factors.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,020
The first one is sort of
the secret you know factor.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,050
The second is something you have factor.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,580
The third is who you are factor.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,570
So it doesn't have to
be just one factor.

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,520
You can actually have
a multi-factor authentication.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,110
One of the quiz questions,
the smart phone and PIN for

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,740
example, the password and
the PIN that is sent or

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,240
the code that is sent to you,
the password is something you know.

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,900
The PIN that is sent to you on the smart
phone is based on the smart phone which

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,560
is something you have, for example.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,720
So you can use more than one factor to
actually make authentication stronger.

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,280
So, as we said we use more than
one method, you type password but

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,840
also send code via SMS, and
this code goes to your phone,

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,290
actually Gmail when you
create an account uses this.

17
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,230
These are called phone verified
accounts or PVAs, mainly

18
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,380
to provide protection against bots
that create a lot of these accounts.

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,820
So this is multi-factor,
because it's not just a password, but

20
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,880
also this code that comes
to a device that you have.

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,290
So that's the second factor.

22
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,750
Your ATM card and

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,250
PIN that you use to get money out of
an ATM machine is actually a two factor.

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,290
The PIN is something you know,
the card itself is something you have.

25
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,630
So these are two factors.

26
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,800
There's another example of
a multi-factor authentication.

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,220
The other methods that use
things like where you are,

28
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,570
your location and IP address of
the machine, OS fingerprint,

29
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,900
these sort of add a little bit of
more to the authentication process.

30
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,040
So when you have multi factor
authentication of course that attacker

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,030
must defeat both to successfully
compromise the authentication method

32
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,650
we have in place.

33
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:49,030
So the authentication we talked
about sort of going to the system,

34
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,920
having a trusted path to the system,
providing the password, fortunately,

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,730
a lot of times you do authentication
over the network where the system

36
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,660
may be thousands of miles away from you.

37
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,260
In fact, a lot of remote services
we access whether it's our email or

38
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,280
our banking system and so on are of
course, we don't walk up to them.

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,770
So, what happens in this case?

40
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,720
We don't have a trusted
path to the system,

41
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,410
remember we sent physical wires from
your keyboard to your machine right in

42
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,780
front of you in close proximity,
That's how we get that trusted path.

43
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,420
The network is open and, obviously,
the same thing doesn't hold there.

44
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,120
So we don't have a trusted path,

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,560
especially when we access
in remote services.

46
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,270
So network authentication
introduces a new problem.

47
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,630
But how do you deal with the absence
of this trusted part that we've been

48
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,424
talking about?

49
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:37,420
Well, actually, we need crypto to
secure the network communication.

50
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,625
So when you talk about network
security in a different lesson,

51
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,995
we're going to address this.

52
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,805
Of course you have to worry
about different kind of threats,

53
00:02:44,805 --> 00:02:47,285
such as man-in-the-middle and
things like that.

54
00:02:47,285 --> 00:02:50,285
But the reason I want to mention,
although we're going to

55
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:53,880
cover this in network security topic,
is that authentication

56
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,580
relies on this fundamental
requirement of this trusted path.

57
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,840
In a network,
you're not going to have that.

58
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,780
So you'll have to do something else
about the lack of the trusted path, or

59
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,038
some method you have to find to
secure the network over which you're

60
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:09,540
going to send the evidence for
authenticating yourself.
