00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,009
Understanding the task or problem domain
is key to designing intelligent systems.

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,189
We call it the environment, and
we refer to the intelligence system or

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,589
software itself as the agent.

4
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:12,609
>> For instance, consider the Roomba.

5
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:17,179
An automated vacuum cleaner that moves
around the house in a consistent pattern

6
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:18,213
sucking up dirt.

7
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:22,007
Its environment consists of the room or
house it is operating in.

8
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:24,533
But more specifically the floor,
walls and

9
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:28,843
all the objects that are on the floor
that it may need to avoid bumping into.

10
00:00:28,843 --> 00:00:31,519
A painting on the wall
is not much of a concern

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,359
>> Now in this case would you say

12
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,808
that the agent is the whole
physical robot itself, or

13
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:40,039
just the software that's running it?

14
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,750
>> That's an excellent question.

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,560
>From a Cartesian point of view,

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,660
you may only consider
the software itself as the agent.

17
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:49,359
While all the hardware components,
including the sensors,

18
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,119
motors would be external to the agent
and thus part of the environment.

19
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,789
>> I would totally agree with that.

20
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:57,871
My hands seem to have a mind of their
own when a bag of chips is placed in

21
00:00:57,871 --> 00:00:58,476
front of me.

22
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:05,094

23
00:01:05,094 --> 00:01:07,873
>> Okay, while that can be
a useful distinction when

24
00:01:07,873 --> 00:01:10,653
analyzing different
internal parts of a Roomba,

25
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:14,920
at a high level I would consider
the entire robot to be the agent.

26
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,030
I like to include all components
that are directly accessable or

27
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,019
controllable with some reliability.

28
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:22,849
>> That makes sense, now let's
think about what information or

29
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:26,459
state a Roomba needs to store
in order to do its job.

30
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:29,599
>> Hm,
kind of like in the tic-tac-toe world.

31
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,949
A Roomba needs to store its current
position as well as all the different

32
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,900
areas that it has already cleaned, so

33
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,680
it doesn't waste time
going around in circles.

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,070
It might be helpful to store a map of
all the obstacles it has seen as well.

35
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:45,629
But they may move over time so
that information can change.

36
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:46,119
>> That's right.

37
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,560
We only represent those items in
the state that are necessary for

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,129
completing the task.

39
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:54,069
Things that are irrelevant, such as the
position of a painting on a wall like

40
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:56,359
you mentioned, can be left out.

41
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,010
>> Finally,

42
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,620
we can specify the result the agent
is trying to achieve as a goal state.

43
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,090
Note that this can be
a partial specification.

44
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,230
For instance, in a navigation problem,

45
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:10,219
we may need to keep track of our
orientation while taking actions.

46
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:13,069
But the goal state only needs
to include the final location.

47
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,019
It could also be a set of different
states that are all considered

48
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,261
acceptable goals.

49
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,128
