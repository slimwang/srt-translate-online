00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,130
This is the first time we have come across the topic of learning in this course,

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,350
so let us examine it a little bit more closely.

3
00:00:07,412 --> 00:00:10,730
We are all interested in asking the question, how do agents learn?

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,800
But this question is not isolated from a series of other questions.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,910
What do agents learn? What is the source of their learning? When do they learn?

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,220
And why do they learn at all? For the purpose of addressing what goal or

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,060
what task? Now here is the fundamental stance that knowledge

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:39,540
based AI takes. It says that we'll start with a theory of reasoning.

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,670
That will help us address questions like, what to learn,

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:48,000
when to learn, why to do learning? And only then will we go to the question,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,710
of how to do the learning. So, we reasoning first, and

12
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,180
then backwards to learning. This happened in production systems.

13
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:02,340
When the production system reach an impasse, then it said let's learn

14
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,550
in order to resolve this impasse from episodic knowledge. So once again,

15
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,760
we are trying to build a unified theory of reasoning, memory, and learning

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,340
where the demands of memory and reasoning constrain the processing of learning.
