00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
The answer here is that there are 2 different shortest paths from A to B.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,850
Starting out at A you can either go up here, then down here, then up here, then down here,

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:15,810
then up here, or you can go down here, up here, down here, up here, down here.

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,480
There is no other possibility of getting from A to B while visiting all vertices

5
00:00:20,480 --> 99:59:59,999
and only taking up 7 edges.
