00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now I'd like to ask you a couple of programming questions.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
These are completely optional, but if you did the programming in the unit,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
you might want to try these out.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
During the unit, you wrote a function that can compute the mean of a set of data.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'd like to now ask you to write something a little different.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Write a function, mean, that can take a known mean of existing data--

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
in this case I called it current mean--

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
a count of the amount of data I have, and a new value

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and tell me what the mean is now.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And so to call my mean function I'll just type in mean(currentmean,currentcount,new)

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And we can see it gives me the correct answer of 9.0.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Here is the function, mean, that you'll fill in.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It takes the old mean which we called current mean below,

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the number of observations--n--and the new value to be added--x.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Insert your code right below the comment. Have fun.
