00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,040
Now that we've learned
the fundamentals of Groovy,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,720
it's up to you to experiment
with some Groovy yourself.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,380
Check out the experiment with Groovy
exercise to get some practice in with

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,100
the concepts we've learned, then,
give the following questions a try.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,150
What do these following lines print?

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,390
You can logic this out, but I would
really recommend just running it and

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,890
seeing what happens.

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,200
The next question might require you to
dig into the documentation a little bit.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,850
What list method allows us to generate
a new list by applying a closure to each

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,060
item in this list.

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,880
Is it map, collect, find, or filter?
