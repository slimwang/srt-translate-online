00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:06,330
Let's do another quiz with our BTB and BHT. Same BHT 16 entries perfect. Same

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,840
BTB four entries perfect. Same program with

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,900
the same addresses. The question for you now

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,500
is which BHT entry do we access

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,777
for each instruction? There are 16 entries, numbered

6
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:22,609
0 through 15. The question is when

7
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:25,289
we are fetching this instruction here, what is

8
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,103
the BHT entry that we're going to be using to predict

9
00:00:28,103 --> 00:00:31,252
it, and then for this instruction, you need to write it

10
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:34,590
here, for this instruction, here, and so on. Again there

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,170
are eight instruction, so we need to have eight numbers here.
