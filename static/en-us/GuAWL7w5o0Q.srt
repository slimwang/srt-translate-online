00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,300
So, in summary, what we discussed in this lecture was some of the foundations of

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,160
how a camera works, presented the concept of a pinhole camera, and

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,870
then basically introduced the concept of optics, and

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,520
how lenses can be used, and what role they play in ma, making a camera.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,370
And how they used to be able to generate images that could be

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,980
stored within a camera.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,080
What we will do now is building on these concepts, we'll look at focal length,

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,880
aperture, if you recall aperture was nothing else but

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,360
the pinhole size, and also we'll add things like what a shutter,

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:40,130
that is how long the opening is, the light opening is used to generate an image.

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,060
And then we'll actually talk about how sensors are used to be able to

12
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,570
store those images.

13
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,300
For additional references, I've listed two books here and

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,520
also additional material is available on some of the sites listed here, and

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,620
I'll be providing more resources on the website.

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,650
And thanks to Mark Levoy,

17
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,840
whose slides some of cost slide concepts were used in making these slides.
