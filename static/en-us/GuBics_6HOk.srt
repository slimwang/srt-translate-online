This video doesn't contain an exhaustive list of everything you

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,140
might have related to exploratory data analysis. But here are

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,390
some of the things that we thought about. If you

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,510
have other ideas, please share your thoughts on the forum. The

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,290
first thing I notice is that Nathan used histograms to

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,910
show the distribution of TV sizes in any given year.

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,190
You can also see that for each year, Nathan included

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,050
a dark line in the middle. Which represents the median size

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,900
television for that year. So in 2005, it looks like

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,950
the median TV size was about 40 inches. So half

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,670
the TVs were larger and half of them were smaller.

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,410
Second, Nathan describes where the data originated. In this case he

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:44,110
got his data from CNET Reviews. Nathan describes a caveat

14
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,470
in the source of his data. He mentioned that the

15
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,570
screen sizes are based on the TVs that were on

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,070
the market at the time and not on how many people

17
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,100
actually bought them. The average television size that people

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,070
bought could be quite different from the average television size

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,870
on the market. I think the second part is key

20
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,350
and is something we should remember when approaching any data

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,010
set. We should always be skeptical of what story the

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,640
data may tell. We should ask questions about our data,

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,550
inspect it and consider its context. Finally, Nathan conducted a

24
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,550
time series analysis. So each year after 2002, Nathan indicates

25
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,080
whether the median size of televisions increased

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,140
or whether or not it decreased. In

27
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,060
the case of the circle, we know that the television size remained the same.

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,100
This leaves me wondering what television sizes are doing now. Maybe you can find

29
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,560
some data out there and let us know by the end of the course.
