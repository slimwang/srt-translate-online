00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,600
I work with youth hockey
in the Seattle area.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,790
And our league has a number of
ice rinks where the kids play.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,500
So with that in mind,
I decided to build a simple app

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,930
that highlights all of the rinks
on a map and here it is.

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,570
As I move around the map, you can
see pins for the different rinks.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,080
As I touch each pin, it highlights with
the name of that particular arena.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,490
This is Kent Valley.

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,203
This is the ShoWare Center.

9
00:00:24,203 --> 00:00:27,080
Or if I zoom up here,
this is my home rink at Renton.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,860
I could, of course, put more information
in here, such as an address, or

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,330
even the dates that I need
to be there for a game.

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,760
But for
now I'm just going to show the pins.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,620
Let's take a look at how to
build an app like this one.
