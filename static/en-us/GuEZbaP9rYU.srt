1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:04,108
16 is 2 to the 4th power and taking the log base 2 of 2 to the 4th means

2
00:00:04,108 --> 00:00:11,254
undoing to the 4 what this exponential function, 2 to the 4th, did to it. So

3
00:00:11,254 --> 00:00:15,511
that means taking it out of the exponent. That gives us 4. Log base 2 of 64 can

4
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:22,593
also be written as log base 2 of 2 to the 6th, which means that this is just 6.
