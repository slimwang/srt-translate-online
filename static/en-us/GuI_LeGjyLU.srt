1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,050
Fairly recently,
there was a large scale breach.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,750
Anthem, actually, I was personally
affected by it, because I do have

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,020
insurance in Blue Cross Blue Shield, and
so Anthem has all these health insurance

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,480
that they offer these companies in
different parts of the country.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,370
And they had a breach, and
Close to 80 million customers

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,770
data was perhaps stolen by
whoever breached their systems.

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:30,650
So this question is about, actually,
what happened after that breach, okay.

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,480
How did Anthem respond to it?

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,120
Did they respond well, or they did not?

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,170
Okay, that's the question.
