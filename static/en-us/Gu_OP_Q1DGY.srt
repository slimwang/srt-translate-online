1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,500
So how do we analyze the data
because sometimes it can get, for

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,090
example, contradicting results.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:11,350
>> Yes so it highly you asked
before what they love to answer,

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,270
you know that by now, it depends.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,630
>> Right.
>> So

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,020
it highly depends on the question
that you're trying to answer, so

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,750
if you're trying to answer a question
such as which design is better?

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,290
Design A or design B?

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,580
There's not a lot of fancy
analysis that goes into that.

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,810
You have numbers that can either show
you that it's either A, B, or a tie.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,400
>> So the majority of people decide?

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,130
>> If it's such a question that,
right, A or B.

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:46,660
But a more complicated question would be
>> Do I

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,770
have a good idea or not or
what do people need?

15
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:56,590
That's hard, not the majority,
sometimes I call these head-bangers.

16
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,880
When you see, only one person that does
something or behaves in a certain way,

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,390
you only need one person to
understand okay, this is important.

18
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,850
I don't care That the nine others
didn't demonstrate this behavior.

19
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,672
I know that this is important.

20
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:16,400
So it's not easy.

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,570
It's a team effort.

22
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,000
It's a team sport.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,670
Research is never the researcher's.

24
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,688
If your startup is fancy
enough to have a researcher,

25
00:01:25,688 --> 00:01:28,750
it's not their responsibility.

26
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,750
It's a team sport.

27
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,650
So the data is not going to
be always very helpful.

28
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,510
So what I like to do is have people
in the team be involved in that.

29
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,730
If you have an engineer, if you have
a product manager, the entrepreneur

30
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:49,110
himself or herself, a designer,
a marketing person, whoever you have.

31
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,280
Have all of these people coming
from all of these angles

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,940
observe the same behavior and
decide what's important here together.

33
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:05,190
That's going to be the way to
analyze and synthesize the data.

34
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,330
To decide together.

35
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,540
It's not always clear.

36
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,550
It's not always easy.

37
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,060
I would say this is
the hardest part of research.

38
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,460
Is understanding okay,
what is the result here?

39
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,970
What did we find out?

40
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,210
Sometimes, I use a tool that I created.

41
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,823
I call it, the rainbow spreadsheet.

42
00:02:23,823 --> 00:02:28,320
So, the rainbow spreadsheet is
a spreadsheet that allows you to List

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,880
all the observations.

44
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,210
Everything that you see,
all the behaviors that you see.

45
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,920
And let's say you obverse, I don't know,
maybe five people, six people,

46
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,732
and then you just highlight or

47
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:44,169
color different cells to see which
participants we call them, people.

48
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:49,588
We invite to participate in research
demonstrated that behavior,

49
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:55,300
and then you get some kind of
histogram of what happened most.

50
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,460
And that's helpful in coming to
conclusions into what happened here and

51
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,070
what does it mean.
