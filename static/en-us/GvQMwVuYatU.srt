00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,300
So, to summarize, in this lecture we basically covered the concepts how we

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,350
can merge two images.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,850
I specifically talked about the cross-fading aspects of it.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,110
We talked about different issues related to it.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,034
And, in essence, how we can compute the size of the window.

6
00:00:14,034 --> 00:00:17,930
And we actually looked at the whole concept of Fourier Domain again,

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,893
that we had looked at previously to help us coming up with some rules and

8
00:00:21,893 --> 00:00:26,860
some processes that would allow us to look at different types of window sizes.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,390
In the next lecture, we're going to take this process a little bit more forward,

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,189
how we can actually do merging and blending.

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,472
We have looked at merging and blending.

12
00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:36,449
We have looked at how we can do this, and understand the issues of

13
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:39,360
window sizes with Fourier domain and all that kind of stuff.

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,680
But now, we'll put it to much more practical tests, and

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,030
look at how we can actually do this by use of pyramids, where we

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:51,280
can do the blending at the lower frequencies, and higher frequencies separately.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,330
As we had discussed, again, we wanted to do feathering and stuff.

18
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,220
But we’ll come up with a much more well-defined approach of how to do this, and

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,030
of course, you’ll you’ll have the opportunity to play around with this also.

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,170
Again, just more information related to the material we covered right now and

21
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,510
additional information will be made available on the website.
