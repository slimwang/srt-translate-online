1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,600
It should be clear now that the first
question to consider, in terms of,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,540
Botnet C&C Design is, how can
the bots contact their master safely?

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,440
In other words,
in a stealthy and robust way.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,980
And as we have just discussed,
a naive approach is not adequate.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,520
For example, if we have
hard-coded the malware to include

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,840
a single IP address of our
command control server,

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,055
then when this IP address has been
identified by security admins.

8
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:31,665
The network admins such
as admins in the ISP

9
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:34,485
can block all traffic to this server.

10
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:36,725
Therefore, no command
control traffic for

11
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:40,392
the bots can be reached to
the file master's server.

12
00:00:40,392 --> 00:00:43,532
And as a result,
the whole botnet's intercepted.

13
00:00:43,532 --> 00:00:47,832
For example, if all the bots come to
a single IP address that's hard-coded in

14
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:53,472
the bot malware, then when this IP
address is identified by secured admins,

15
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:59,190
the network admins, for example those at
ISP, can block all traffic to this IP.

16
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,770
Therefore, blocking all
command control traffic and

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,569
disrupting the operations of the botnet.

18
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,820
And because such naive approach
is not stealthy nor robust,

19
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,290
it is only used by script-kiddies and
first-time malware authors.

20
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,850
In addition to safety, utility is
also very important to the Botmaster.

21
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,290
In other words, a Botmaster wants
efficient and reliable communications,

22
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,770
so that he can reach and coordinate
enough bots to perform a specific task.

23
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,860
So to summarize the design
considerations of Botnet C&C,

24
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,120
the Botmaster would want efficient and
reliable communication.

25
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,250
That is the ability to reach a sizable
set of bots within certain time limit.

26
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,940
Stealthy communication, so
that it is hard to detect C&C traffic.

27
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,440
Resilient or robust communication, so
that it is very hard to disable or

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,446
block C&C traffic.
