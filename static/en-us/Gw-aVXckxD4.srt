00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,680
So, here I have a folder on my computer

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,320
with a bunch of photos. Now, you'll notice that

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,795
the message in these photos is all jumbled up,

4
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:10,570
we can't quite read it just yet. Now, if I

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,600
zoom into these photos, you'll notice that the names

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,400
of the photos, they have numbers in them. And it's

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,240
our task to remove those numbers. And I wrote

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,650
a program that does just that. Let me run it.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,325
The output window shows all of the files that were renamed and if I look at the

10
00:00:28,325 --> 00:00:30,590
folders again, you'll notice that the photos have

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,110
been renamed. Their names don't have any numbers in

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,940
them anymore. Also, if I zoom out just

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,500
a little bit. You'll notice that the photos are

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,450
now revealing a message. Which in this case

15
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,410
is just, SOME SECRET MESSAGE. Let's build this program.
