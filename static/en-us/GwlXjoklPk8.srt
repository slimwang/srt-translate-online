1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,624
Like the others, Skinner thought that we evolved such that we have the vocal

2
00:00:03,624 --> 00:00:08,151
apparatus to be able to learn language. And in fact Skinner though that we

3
00:00:08,151 --> 00:00:11,866
learn language just like we learn any other behavior. And that's why he calls

4
00:00:11,866 --> 00:00:16,524
it verbal behavior. We are surrounded by verbal communities and they teach us

5
00:00:16,524 --> 00:00:21,620
the sounds and words that are effective in that community. And you'll notice

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,702
that parents use imitation and reinforcement when teaching their children how

7
00:00:24,702 --> 00:00:29,896
to talk. That's right Johnny, you said water, good job. So in addition to

8
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:34,667
reinforcement, you may also be punished for language. For example, perhaps you

9
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,393
said a curse word in front of somebody you shouldn't have and you got in

10
00:00:37,393 --> 00:00:42,328
trouble for it. If you speak differently to your friends than you do to your

11
00:00:42,328 --> 00:00:45,760
parents or your grandparents, you would have what Skinner would say, audience

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,097
control. Meaning you're reinforced to speak in a certain way in front of some

13
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:52,811
people, and speaking that way in front of others, you could actually be

14
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:58,833
punished. If language were discovered, then why didn't Jeannie learned how to

15
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:02,839
speak. Well actually, we saw that Jeannie did try to speak, and was imitating,

16
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:08,275
but she was punished for it, remember, her dad barked at her. Therefore she had

17
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:12,083
limited language skills. Finally we're going to ask again why is it very

18
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:15,743
important and we hope that we can get some practical applications from a

19
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:21,383
theory. And it turns out theory of Skinner in verbal behavior using principles

20
00:01:21,383 --> 00:01:25,352
of operand conditioning has been very effective in teaching children with

21
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:30,276
autism how to speak. And they even use these theories to teach individuals with

22
00:01:30,276 --> 00:01:32,500
intellectual disabilities how to speak.
