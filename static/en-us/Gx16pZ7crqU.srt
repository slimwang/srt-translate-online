1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So we're going to go back to the live web app we were working in before.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is the main file we were using.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm not going to ask you to follow along with me anymore

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
because I'm going to be writing more code,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and it'll be tedious for you to try and keep up.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'll try to type slowly, and we'll quiz as I go.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So the first thing we're going to do is adjust this file to work better for our needs.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So remember, we we're submitting to a different URL before.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We were submitting to /testform.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's when we were learning about multiple handlers.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We're going to get rid of that.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We're going to get rid of that action parameter,

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and we're going to get rid of that whole handler.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We're not going to be using that anymore.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And we're also going to get rid of the URL reference to that handler.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We don't need that anymore.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So now I've simplified this file quite a bit.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We have our simple form that we were using before,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and we have our main handler that's mapped to by /.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
/ maps the MainPage. Here's MainPage with a get function.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And this get function just prints our form.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is a very simple example we started with from the very beginning.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's make sure this still works.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Here we are in our browser.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We've got our basic form. Everything is as we expected it.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay, let's go back to the Editor.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So instead of having this basic form of just a text field,

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
we're going to make a form to ask somebody for their birthday.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So we can validate their inputs.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So let's get rid of this input.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and we're going to ask the user, what is your birthday?

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We'll have a blank line.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Then we'll have 3 inputs--1 for the month, 1 for the day, and 1 for the year.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So I'll go ahead and add those.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So I've updated our form a little bit.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It has a string, what is your birthday?, a blank line, 3 inputs, all of type text

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and they're named month, day, and year, 2 more blank lines,

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and then our submit button.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's check how that looks in our browser.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Here we are in our browser.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We've got our text, what is your birthday?

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We've got our 3 inputs for month, day, and year, and our submit button.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I made the font a little bigger in the browser, so we could read it better.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Now this is not very clear what we're asking for.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Remember we have a solution for that though.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's add some labels so we can see month, day, and year next to our text inputs.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So here we are in our Editor again.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm going to add a few labels.

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Okay, so all I did is, I added label elements like we did in the previous examples.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Here's an opening label, our old month input,

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
some month text to appear next to our text input, and then the closing label.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I did that for each of these inputs--month, day, and year.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's see how that looks in our browser.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay, here we are in our browser.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I've reloaded it, and things are looking nice.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Now we can see that we're asking for the month, the day, and the year.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now I'm going to type in some data here,

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and I'd like you to tell me what you think is going to happen when I click submit.

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So when I hit submit on that form, what do you think is going to happen?

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Will the form clear?

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Will we get an Error 405 because we never added a post() handler to /?

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We'll see the form values in the URL?

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Or will the app count down to my birthday?
