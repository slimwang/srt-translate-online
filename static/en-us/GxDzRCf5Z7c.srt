1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,850
All right so
we'll wind down a little bit.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,140
>> Okay.
>> Don't look at the coded questions.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,660
But, explain to me,

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,420
a time where you had like a technical
challenge, or like a big problem.

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,090
What was the problem?

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,460
And like how did you work through it?

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,316
How did you eventually solve it?

8
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:19,127
>> Okay.

9
00:00:19,127 --> 00:00:24,230
Big technical challenge for
me recently, so

10
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:29,610
I've been learning some
back end stuff right.

11
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,490
>> Okay.
>> As well so

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,210
learning Python and backend.

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,340
So there was just learning how
servers work how databases work,

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,528
how to do it in Python using
certain web framework.

15
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:45,480
And i wantED to create a website that

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,330
basically just had a, You know,
just simple told website just be able to

17
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,960
figure out okay I want
to make a database.

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,700
I want to have a database
of pictures and

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,470
then i want to survey
I want make a point.

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:03,600
So the first thing i ask myself,
how do I make an API in place.

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,120
I know how to do in front end in
Ajax requests like okay I'll just

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,070
send off this request to a server and
I were to return your JSON.

23
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,910
But how do I actually return the JSON
in from the server side now?

24
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,820
>> The other side
>> The other

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,920
side of the picture
>> All right

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,739
>> So i had to like figure out,

27
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:25,760
okay does Python have a library so
i helped me write JSON, and it does.

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,050
So you know.

29
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:27,560
I'm okay great.

30
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,200
So if.

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,160
Maybe okay maybe if i can figure out,
you know, first of all.

32
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,077
Think about what's my input right like,
okay input just could be some sort of

33
00:01:38,077 --> 00:01:42,350
parameter that the front end's
going to be hitting my server.

34
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,660
I need to unpack it.

35
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,410
Okay.
I have my corrie parameters.

36
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:51,980
But now how do i access my database and
like that was that was tough because

37
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,040
i was learning a new type of database
system so I had to like learn a lot of.

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,920
Look through a lot of stack overflow
look through a lot of forum posts.

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,080
Look through example code.

40
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,860
Make sure that I understand
okay how would I isolate this.

41
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,720
If i need to access this database
using this database system

42
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,250
because I'm using the Google App Engine.

43
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,130
>> Okay.

44
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:17,070
>> Basically and they recommend to use
their own data store system like okay,

45
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,680
well this basically like ORM,
like object relational mapping system.

46
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,880
That they have and it, yeah.

47
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,100
That was my first time using ORM.

48
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,870
>> Okay.

49
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,660
>> So, because i'm used
to running SQL commands.

50
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,660
>> Okay.

51
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,090
>> So I had to understand,
okay, if this object,

52
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,350
if I access is this object like I would
normally it would return the data to me.

53
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,520
>> Like that,
those could be confusing to me.

54
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,401
So it was a world that
was unfamiliar for me.

55
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:46,010
My first step was just
to look at tutorials,

56
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,220
look at videos and just try to figure
out ok what has our other people done.

57
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,530
Like to look at their example code and

58
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,040
just like really work at
that one aspect of like.

59
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,500
Okay I need to figure out
how to use this database and

60
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,380
then pulled its information.

61
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,355
Once I figure that out.

62
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:05,450
Okay i need to go back to my entire
project and figure out okay.

63
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,930
Once i get my data.

64
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,110
How do i transform it into a JSON?

65
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,810
Fortunately for me Python have
Dictionaries which is very similar

66
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:20,390
to JSON is so and i'm using The JSON
library, so the JSON library

67
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,880
will be able to convert,
>> Translate between.

68
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,830
>> Translate between the dictionary and
the JSON.

69
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:32,030
Okay, I got that, and my last thing, was
how do I tell the server to output JSON?

70
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,640
Because usually,
I would just output HTML.

71
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,440
That's how I learned.

72
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,560
That's the first thing I learned
was using service stuff so

73
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,714
I need to look around stack
overflow get my JSON.

74
00:03:45,714 --> 00:03:49,130
Those are headers you need to like
write out to some headers and

75
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,210
tell them okay exactly the type
the content type that you were turning.

76
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,630
And there's a thing called
application slash Jason.

77
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,490
You need to change that header manually.

78
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:04,140
And then after that I have my
JSON library, which I could load.

79
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,180
I could refer to my dictionary,
because I got my data from a dictionary.

80
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,780
Then I convert that into JSON.

81
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,830
And then, from then on,
I just use the normal function to

82
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,360
actually write output to the server,
to the front end.

83
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,930
>> Yeah.

84
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,649
>> Which is just that converted JSON.

85
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:22,790
And then it worked.

86
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,210
So yeah, that was my whole story of
question how to figure out if i want to

87
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,220
do it that's all there is like all these
other days i had to figure out but.

88
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,230
On my own, step-by-step so
i always like trying to figure out okay.

89
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,960
Were the main steps i need to take.

90
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,380
How do i make sure that i unpack it?

91
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,350
And just focus on small little tasks,
once I had that then that task.

92
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,930
Those small tasks will build
a little book to like my project.
