We've seen now that if the graph of a function doesn't have any breaks in it,

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:07,300
then the curve is going to pass through all the y values that lie between the y

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,202
value of the starting point and the y value of the ending point of whatever

4
00:00:10,202 --> 00:00:16,550
region of the graph that we're looking at. This concept has a special name.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,850
It's called the intermediate value theorem. Now, let's say that all we know

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,306
about the two end points of this curve, which I've now labeled A and B, is that

7
00:00:25,306 --> 00:00:31,296
the y-coordinate of point A is a negative. And the y-coordinate of point B is

8
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:35,214
positive. If that's the case, then what is the one value of y that we know the

9
00:00:35,214 --> 00:00:40,475
curve has to pass through between point A and point B? There's only one that we

10
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:44,283
can be completely sure of. Think carefully about this.
