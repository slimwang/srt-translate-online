1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,621
So, you might have noticed that I
preemptively added a little Edit Name

2
00:00:03,621 --> 00:00:04,723
button in the Menu Bar.

3
00:00:04,723 --> 00:00:07,905
If you click on it,
the Edit Name dialog pops up.

4
00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:11,697
Now that you know more about Firebase's
four write methods, can you add the code

5
00:00:11,697 --> 00:00:15,620
so that the app actually updates
the name of the Firebase shopping list?

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,240
Here, I'll show you what I mean.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,710
Right here is the Edit List
button that I was talking about.

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,540
When you press it, it'll show a dialog.

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,440
You should be able to type
the name in here, and

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,930
then press Edit Name to edit
the name of the shopping list.

11
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,820
Shopping lists contain a few properties,
and

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,400
right now the listName is the only one
that we're making directly editable.

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,010
The name of the owner will not change.

14
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,320
Right now the owners are all
named anonymous owner,

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,040
which is rather ominous sounding, but

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,310
we'll worry about fixing that when we
add user accounts in the next version.

17
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,070
Now the timestampLastChanged
property is interesting.

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,710
It should update whenever we
change any part of the list, so

19
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,850
when we change the listName,
timestampLastChanged will be modified,

20
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,550
but it won't be directly
modified by the user.

21
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,620
So, when we change the listName,
timestampLastChanged should also change.

22
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,230
It's worth noting that, in the future,
this area will contain a list of items

23
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,470
in the shopping list, but
that will come later in this version.

24
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,290
Right now,
just focus on making the name and

25
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,580
the timestamp change using the right
methods we just talked about.

26
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,890
I'll send you a full spec right now.
