1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,430
So let's say we perform that search,
we had a big search tree, and

2
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:07,019
then we threw out all
the branches except one.

3
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:10,629
And this branch of the search tree
does itself have branches, but

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,850
this branch of the search tree,
through the belief state,

5
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:18,269
represents a single plan,
not multiple possible plans.

6
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:19,704
Now what I want to know is, for

7
00:00:19,704 --> 00:00:22,619
the single plan,
what can we guarantee about it?

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,280
So, say we wanted to know is this
plan guaranteed to find the goal

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,470
in an unbounded number of steps?

10
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:31,839
And what do we need to guarantee that?

11
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,060
So it's an unbounded solution.

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:40,500
Do we need to guarantee that
some leaf node is a goal?

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,979
So for example,
here the plan it goes through and

14
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:46,890
at the bottom there's a leaf node.

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,799
Now if this were in problem solving,

16
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,329
then remember it would be a sequence
of steps with no branches in it.

17
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:00,277
And we know it's a solution if
the one leaf node is a goal.

18
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:05,319
But for these other branches, do we need
to guarantee that some leaf is a goal?

19
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,579
Or do we need to guarantee
that every leaf is a goal?

20
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,759
Or is there no possible guarantee
that will mean that for

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,780
sure we've got a solution, although
the solution maybe of unbounded length.

22
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,730
And I also want you to answer,

23
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,890
what does it take to guarantee
that we have a bounded solution?

24
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,069
That is a solution that is
guaranteed to reach the goal

25
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:33,924
in a bounded finite number of steps.

26
00:01:33,924 --> 00:01:39,590
Do we need to have a plan that has
no branches in it, like this branch?

27
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,780
Or a plan that has no loops in it,

28
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,439
like this loop that goes
back to a previous state?

29
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,769
Or is there no guarantee that
we have a bounded solution?
