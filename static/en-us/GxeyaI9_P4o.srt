00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] Let me ask you a second quiz.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Again, we haven't talked about any details.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I would like to get your intuition on the following question.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Suppose in a two dimensional space,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
all data lies as follows.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This may be reminiscent of the question I

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
asked you for housing prices and square footage.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Suppose we have 2 axes, X1 and X2.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm going to ask you 2 questions here.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
One is what is the dimensionality of this space

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
in which this data falls, and the second one

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
is an intuitive question which is

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
how many dimensions do you need

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to represent this data to capture the essence,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and, again, this is not a clear crisp 0 or 1 type question,

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
but give me your best guess.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
How many dimensions are intuitively needed?
