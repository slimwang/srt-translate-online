00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,920
Hm. You know,

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,550
I bet you're curious what the stuff you're learning has to do with real design.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,340
We've talked about affordances and signifiers and a little bit about conceptual

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,750
models. Well, here's some real design. Let's, let's talk about it. See

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:25,360
this? It's a tape dispenser. And we have the tape [SOUND] something designed

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,200
at the end so it doesn't stick. And the holder, the dispenser and look at

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,400
this. The packaging. The designer has to think

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,410
it all through. It isn't enough to design

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,266
the product. You have to design how

10
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:41,820
it's mounted, the packaging, instruction manuals, even the

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,990
box in which it shipped. That's kind of

12
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,590
what's exciting about design, it's the whole system.
