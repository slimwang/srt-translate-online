This goes out to all my students around the world. Hm[MUSIC] So you got some

2
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:12,356
sample mean x bar is 5 and the size of 17. Is this typical? Well, what you

3
00:00:12,356 --> 00:00:18,100
gotta know? The sampling distribution is the way to go.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:24,740
>> Way to go. You've got the sampling. Distribution 09 to 0. So you got some

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:31,216
population mu1, sigma 2, you need a derivation for the standard deviation. Need

6
00:00:31,216 --> 00:00:37,207
motivation it's as simple as pi. Sigma divided by root n. Why? 'Cuz it's the

7
00:00:37,207 --> 00:00:42,662
central limit theorem. Now find your z, subtract the mean and divide by se,

8
00:00:42,662 --> 00:00:49,840
what's the probability? It's not a lot. Less than alpha level, you reject H0.
