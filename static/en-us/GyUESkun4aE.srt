1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,710
Inside the box class I've added
the CSS property will change and

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,270
set it to transform.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,320
And immediately there is
a huge performance boost.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,740
That looks pretty close
to 60 frames per second.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,130
Promoting elements to layers
can be super awesome for

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,820
avoiding paint problems.

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,760
Especially those related to movement or
opacity changes.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,730
If you change a visual property though,
like say for instance, text color or

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,720
shadows.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,720
Promoting an element
won't help in any way,

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,590
because you'll still have to paint it.

12
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,280
So make sure you're only using layer
promotion when it makes sense.
