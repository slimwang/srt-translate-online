You might have just looked at the data and seen that the prices for Snapzi are

00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:10,014
less than Irisa and LolaMoon, or you might have calculated the means. The mean

00:00:10,014 --> 00:00:16,711
shirt price for this sample from Snapzi brand is $13. For Irisa, the mean is

00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:21,987

00:00:21,987 --> 00:00:28,260

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,042
We could do three t-tests to statistically show if there's a significant

00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:37,190
difference or not, but in this lesson, you'll learn a simpler method.
