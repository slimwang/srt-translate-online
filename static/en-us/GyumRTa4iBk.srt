1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,190
So, so far the two operations that we've looked at have been query operations.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,119
That is, they've been asking about the values of attributes. However,

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:14,210
in interesting information systems, in addition to querying,

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,209
you need to have operations that actually change the state of things.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,060
And, so this is going to be ultimately implemented with the database and

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,810
you need the ability to add records, to change records, and that sort of thing.

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:36,000
We call particular operations that don't make any changes like this pure,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,800
as in pure functions. Because they're similar to mathematical functions,

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,630
which always compute the same result. Functions which are impure,

10
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,260
are said to have side effects. And side effects might be changing the values on

11
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:56,990
the database. They might be doing IO operations, input output operations.

12
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:02,390
Or flashing something on the screen that the user sees. what, whatever it is.

13
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:09,060
So, those are side effects. And, so, now, as the next, next step in our,

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,200
modeling of these requirements, let's try to specify a more complex situation.

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,730
One where an operation actually results in a change of state. In this case, we

16
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,750
choose to model the actual process of checking out a Loanableitem as indicated

17
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,689
in requirement five. A patron can check out books or audio visual materials
