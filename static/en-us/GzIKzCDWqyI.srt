1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
If you look at the equations of the SIR model, the meaning of this constant

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
in front of the I here is pretty clear.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This number of 5 days controls the infectious period of the disease,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but what about the first constant here that controls the rate of infection.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Assume that we're looking at a secluded small town with 1,000 inhabitants in total

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and assume that everyone meets 25 persons per day, and third, assume that the infection probability

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
is 2% per contact, which number should be entered here.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Just input that number.
