00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,010
After learning about watch faces,
you now have a complete understanding

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,290
of how to write any kind of
application for Android wear.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,730
Watches have been used for hundreds
of years to be able to tell the time

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,300
as well as a personal
statement of style.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,100
Now you have the ability to dream up
any kind of watch face design, and

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,020
then implement it on Android wear.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,860
This will keep your users up to date and

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,830
on time with relevant information to
their life all with a simple glance.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,650
I'm looking forward to seeing what kinds
of beautiful watch faces you develop for

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,800
android wear users.
