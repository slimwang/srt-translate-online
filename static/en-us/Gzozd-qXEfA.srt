1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So I've added 1 more test,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
but I've added a bunch of new hands,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and since it seemed to be getting complicated,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I documented what each hand is.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And the key point here is one particular hand

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
or one particular set of rankings which is a straight

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that goes from ace through 5.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
An ace, 2, 3, 4, 5.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's almost a straight flush, but we just missed, but that's not important.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What's important is that it's a straight

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and that the ace is low,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and this is the only hand or the only set of rankings

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
in which the ace counts as a low card rather than a high card,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and in our program, we'll mess that up in 2 ways.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
One is we won't even recognize this as a straight

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
because we're counting the ace as being a 14, not as being a 1,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
so we won't know that it's a straight, and secondly,

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
even if we did, we'd want to count the 5 as being the high card

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
in this hand, not the ace.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We've got to come up with something to deal with that,

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
so let's see, what are the possibilities?

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, perhaps we want to modify the function straight.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We also want to return the correct hand rank for this hand,

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
so maybe we have to modify the function hand rank.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And third, the card ranks probably have to change as well.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We want the card ranks for this hand to have

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
a 1 for the straight rather than a 14.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And what do you think about the prospects of making 3 changes?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Would you say that that's okay because the changes that you envision making

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
seem to be small ones to the 3 functions?

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Would you say it's okay regardless of the size of the change?

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's just the way it is. We have to put up with it.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Or would you say we should be able to do better?

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And we should look for a solution that doesn't require

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
changing all 3 functions.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What would you vote for?
