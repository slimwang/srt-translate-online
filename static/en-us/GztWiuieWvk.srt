1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,670
Here's what we're going to do that's
actually going to be even better than

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,270
dying one ninth at a time.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:12,550
What we're going to do is we're
going to introduce a third party, so

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,775
here's Here's Smooth
>> Mm.

5
00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:14,895
>> And here's Curly.

6
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:15,395
>> Yep.

7
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:18,975
>> And then,
here's my best sort of drawing of Chris

8
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:21,095
who's helping us with this class,
our course creator.

9
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:23,614
>> Course creator [CROSSTALK] I
like course creator better because

10
00:00:23,614 --> 00:00:24,283
then it's CCC.

11
00:00:24,283 --> 00:00:24,942
>> CCC.

12
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,773
[CROSSTALK] The course developer
CD which is on the screen.

13
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:30,425
That's true, course developer Chris,
OK we'll do that.

14
00:00:30,425 --> 00:00:31,345
Does sound like a good hip hop name.

15
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:32,750
You know what we should do?

16
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,230
We should do some kind
of wrap of some sort.

17
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,320
>> You're going to have to teach me
because I don't know how to do that.

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,800
>> Okay.
Well, we'll talk about it later.

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,820
Okay.
So,

20
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,240
we're going to put our little CD here
and he is going to stand between us so

21
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,120
he's going to act as a kind of go
between, and what he's going to do is

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,730
he's going to make a decision for
us of a certain sort.

23
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,680
S, here's the decision that
we're going to have Chris do.

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,680
Chris is going to Write
down three cards.

25
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,420
One's going to say (C, C),
one's going to say (D, C), and

26
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,050
one's going to say (C,D).

27
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,420
>> Three cards.

28
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,290
>> Three cards.

29
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:00,790
Okay?

30
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,070
>> Yeah.
>> And he's going to shuffle those cards

31
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:03,930
and then pick one of them.

32
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,030
So in other words he
is going to uniformly,

33
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,780
randomly choose among (C,
C), (D, C), and (C, D).

34
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,600
Comedy.
Okay.

35
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,560
>> Yeah, yeah.
Okay, I get it.

36
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,610
>> So, you'll notice that's
three of the four strategies.

37
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,830
>> It's three of the four strategy.

38
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,470
Yeah, you're missing Deedee.

39
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,740
>> Deedee, which is the worst one.

40
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,160
>> Yeah, so you should put that one in.

41
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,720
>> No.
>> Okay.

42
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,620
>> Well, I could put it in and give it
and assign it a probability of zero.

43
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,410
>> But I like that you're their cards
and they have equal probability.

44
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,010
>> Right, they'll have equal
probability, so uniform choice.

45
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:29,950
All right, so are you with me?

46
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,570
>> I guess so.
>> Okay, so

47
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,720
Chris randomly picks one
of these three things.

48
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,490
Neither of us knows what it is and we
don't know anything about what the other

49
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,490
has but Chris gets to pick up this card.

50
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,580
And then what Chris is going to
do is something very simple.

51
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,420
Chris is going to inform one of us,
perhaps both of us, one after the other,

52
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,870
and Chris is going to, let's say for
the purposes of this discussion,

53
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:51,310
Chris is going to inform one of us
of what that person's action is.

54
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,740
Let's say Chris picks c,c.

55
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,190
Chris will turn to me and
will say, I want you to choose c.

56
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,830
Now, Chris would also turn to you and
say, I want you to choose c.

57
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,330
Okay?
>> And there's no conflict there,

58
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,050
because we can both chicken.

59
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,030
>> Do whatever you want to do.

60
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,320
I'm just telling you.

61
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,419
Here's what the card says you should do.

62
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,830
All right card says you
should chicken out.

63
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,400
>> And
he's going to force me to do that now?

64
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,170
>> No, let me do one more example though
before I really answer that question.

65
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,110
>> All right.
>> Let's say Chris had accidentally and

66
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,150
that is uniformly probabilistically
chosen the comma c.

67
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,870
>> Yes.

68
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,470
>> Then Chris would turn to me and

69
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,520
say the card says
>> You should do D.

70
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,150
Chris would turn to you and
say the card says you should do C.

71
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,090
>> But I would know that he was
actually just making me chicken out

72
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,770
because that's what people do.

73
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,320
>> No, that's because
that's what the card says.

74
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,280
Now let me be a little bit
clearer here because I wasn't.

75
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,130
These three cards
are known to both of us.

76
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,540
And we know that there's a uniform
probability of getting any of

77
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,530
those three cards.

78
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,140
And we trust Chris enough that he's not
going to always give you the good thing.

79
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,620
>> Yes, he's going to with
probability one-third.

80
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,150
>> Okay.

81
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,970
>> Do that, okay?

82
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,620
>> I trust Chris.

83
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,280
>> I trust Chris.

84
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,050
Look at that hair.

85
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,040
How could you not trust Chris?

86
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,780
Okay, so Chris is going to pick one of
these cards, and then tell each of us

87
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,700
what it is we're going to do or
what we're being asked to do.

88
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,330
>> Okay.

89
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,350
>> But not tell us what the other
person is being asked to do.

90
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,070
Okay.
>> So that's important, got it?

91
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:11,920
>> Yeah, that's interesting.

92
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,390
>> Okay.
>> because I can use inference.

93
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,230
>> You can use inference.

94
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,080
So in fact, let me ask you
what inference you should use.

95
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,720
So-
>> Bayesian inference, or

96
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,540
you didn't ask it, I'm sorry.

97
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,070
>> I didn't ask it.

98
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,780
So, in fact, I'm going to,
because you said Bayesian.

99
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,440
>> I didn't say Bayesian.

100
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,960
>> You just said Bayesian inference,
I'm going to make this a quiz.

101
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,530
>> As punishment for
saying Bayesian, okay.

102
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,040
>> Yes, how dare you.
