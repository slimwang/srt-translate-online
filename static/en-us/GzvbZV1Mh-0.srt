00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,875
Let's try something that will
require a bit more problem solving.

2
00:00:03,875 --> 00:00:07,200
Given some code that draws
a bunch of concentric rectangles,

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,550
could make some small changes so
it draws a spiral instead.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,670
Open up the exercise project and
give it a try.

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:14,910
All right,

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,390
because this one's pretty tricky I'm
going to give some visual spoilers.

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,740
So I'm going to show you how to move
some line segments around here so

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,870
that these rectangles
instead turn into a spiral.

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,610
So all we're going to do is move this
little chunk of each rectangle so

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,870
that it faces this way instead.

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,444
So we're going to connect and
then erase, and

12
00:00:35,444 --> 00:00:40,019
connect and erase,
connect and erase, and

13
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:43,860
erase, and now we've got a spiral.
