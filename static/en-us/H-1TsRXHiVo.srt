1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The correct answer is: The parameter doesn't appear at all on the URL.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's try that out in the browser to see it, for real.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So here we are in our browser; I click Submit,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
with the checkbox unchecked,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and there is no "q" parameter in the URL. Simple enough.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now--when I'm writing Server site software

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to look at these values,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I usually check for the "q" parameter equaling "on"

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and anything different from that means it's "off".

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's because I don't believe that all browsers

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
are going to behave quite the same here.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I know "on" is "on"--but, maybe it says "this string off"--who knows.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So I always just check for one case,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,214
and the default case will just be "off".
