1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,657
The standard error we've been using assumes that the samples are approximately

2
00:00:03,657 --> 00:00:08,410
the same size. We must correct for the sample size first by pooling the

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,623
variances. So now, we're going to slightly change the standard error that we've

4
00:00:12,623 --> 00:00:16,820
been using. The pooled variance, which we'll denote S sub p squared, because

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,596
remember that S squared was the variance and S was the standard deviation, is

6
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:24,313
the average of the two sample variances that corrects for different sample

7
00:00:24,313 --> 00:00:31,646
sizes. Remember when we had one sample that the variance was the sum of squares

8
00:00:31,646 --> 00:00:35,806
divided by the degrees of freedom, which written out is the sum of this squared

9
00:00:35,806 --> 00:00:41,633
deviations divided by n minus 1. With pooled variances, we're doing almost the

10
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:46,116
same thing. When we have two samples, we'll add the sum of squares for each,

11
00:00:46,116 --> 00:00:51,026
and then divide by the sum of the degrees of freedom. Let's go through an

12
00:00:51,026 --> 00:00:56,089
example. Let's say we have two samples, which we'll call x and y. We want to

13
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,452
know if the populations that these samples are from are significantly

14
00:00:59,452 --> 00:01:04,572
different. First, find the sum of squares for each. Remember that to do this

15
00:01:04,572 --> 00:01:08,478
you'll have to find each deviation from the mean, and then, square them, and

16
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,370
then add them up. You're welcome to write each deviation and squared deviation

17
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,503
in these columns, but you don't have to. We just provide the boxes there, so

18
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:22,740
that that can help you as you calculate the sum of squares. But you can always

19
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,738
use technology, Excel or R/g, or whatever you want to use. Or you can just do

20
00:01:27,738 --> 00:01:32,888
it by hand rather than typing them in. Whatever is easiest, as long as you get

21
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:34,780
these sum of squares.
