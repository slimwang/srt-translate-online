00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,570
Well, the intention of this lesson is to introduce you to the topic of software

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,200
architecture. That we're going to be looking at in more detail in subsequent

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,400
lessons. The ultimate goal of course, is to produce high quality systems and

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,090
reduce the cost of producing them. The key way of doing that is the early

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,030
detection of problems. And the key way of detecting things early is to

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:25,750
try to layout in advance, what the, what the system is going to look like.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:31,610
You want to have explicit recognition of what the issues are, explicit rationale

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,514
for how they are being handled. We want to be able to on the productivity side

9
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:41,536
to deal with any existing assets we can apply toward the solution. And

10
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:46,526
we want to be able to construct an architecture at a sufficient level of

11
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:50,411
abstraction. That it can be used to convey all these idea quickly and

12
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:52,800
effectively to all the stakeholders involved.
