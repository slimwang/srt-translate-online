00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,245
How'd you do? If you got 14 ounces, great work. Let's see how we got that

2
00:00:04,257 --> 00:00:08,675
answer. When we do ratio problems, it's important to put the ratio in words

3
00:00:08,687 --> 00:00:13,195
before we put numbers. So, the ratio I need to write is the amount of chocolate

4
00:00:13,207 --> 00:00:17,048
chips over the number of cookies. So, the ratio we want to write here is how

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,363
many ounces of chocolate chips we need for how many cookies. We know that

6
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:23,874
there's 8 ounces of chocolate chips, so we know the amount of chocolate chips.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,386
But we don't know the number of cookies because this tells us we have 2 dozen

8
00:00:27,398 --> 00:00:31,390
cookies. For those of you that don't know, one dozen is equal to 12. For

9
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:35,855
example, when you buy a dozen eggs, you get 12 eggs. So, if we have 2 dozen

10
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:40,760
cookies, that's going to be 24 cookies. So we need 8 ounces of chocolate chips

11
00:00:40,772 --> 00:00:45,620
for 24 cookies. The question says, how many ounces of chips we need to make 42

12
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:50,505
cookies? So, the number of cookies is 42, and we want to know how many ounces of

13
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:55,220
chocolate chips we need. We know the number of cookies we need to make is 42,

14
00:00:55,313 --> 00:00:59,086
and we have to find out how many ounces of chocolate chips. So, this is what

15
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:02,952
we're looking for. I'm going to use the variable c in this case. We have two

16
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:06,849
ratios. When we set them equal to each other, that creates a proportion. To

17
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:10,951
solve a proportion, we simply cross-multiply. When we cross-multiply, we get 24

18
00:01:10,963 --> 00:01:16,755
times c is equal to 8 times 42. So, we get 24 c equals 8 times 42 is 336. To

19
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:22,870
solve this, all we have to do is divide both sides by 24. 336 divided by 24 is

20
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:29,148
14. So, we get c equals 14, which means we need 14 answers of chocolate chips to

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,183
make 42 cookies. Are you ready to try another one?
