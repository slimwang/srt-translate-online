00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,490
So, today we discussed frames, which are one of the knowledge

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,200
representations that we'll see throughout this course. We started off by talking

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,050
about the basic structure of frames which involves slots and fillers, and

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,165
we talked about how similar they are to the variables and values that we see in

5
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:15,570
object-oriented programming. We then talked about the three main properties of

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,830
frames which are that they represent stereotypes of a certain concept, they

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,950
provide default values, and they can inherit from one another. We then talked

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,270
about frames in terms of other concepts we've already covered in this course.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,270
We talked about how frames are representationally equivalent to semantic nets,

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,310
and we've talked about how frames were actually what we were using when

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,780
we were doing projection systems last lesson. We finally talked about some of

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,620
the advanced reasoning and story understanding that we can do with frames.

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,250
Now we're going to move to a topic called learning by recording cases,

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,740
where we learn from individual cases or individual experiences. But

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,280
if you're very interested in frames, you might want to jump forward to

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,430
our lessons on understanding common sense reasoning and scripts.

17
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,270
This will all very heavily leverage what we've learned about frames today
