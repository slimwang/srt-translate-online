1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,040
So here's one way to solve the quiz; we're going to create a dictionary

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,520
called Population, and then we'll add some cities to it. We'll add Shanghai,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,345
has population 17.8 million. Istanbul has population

4
00:00:14,345 --> 00:00:19,870
13.3 million. Karachi has population 13 million, and

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:24,900
Mumbai has population 12.5. I'm also going to add my home town,

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,160
which is Charlottesville, and the population of Charlottesville is pretty small

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:39,540
compared to Shanghai. It is 0.043 million people. Only 43,000. So now we've

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,470
created our dictionary. We've populated it with some entries. We can print those

9
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:50,444
out. So if we look at the value of population of Shanghai,

10
00:00:50,444 --> 00:00:54,860
that will get that entry in the dictionary, and we can see that we get the

11
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,460
result 17.8; we can also print out the

12
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:03,105
population of Charlottesville, and we get the result 0.043
