1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,630
Let's look at the computation pipeline for a Video Analytics application. Let's

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,840
say I'm interested in detecting and tracking some anomalous

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,220
event. So I have cameras, which captures the images from a particular

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,340
environment. And you're detecting for something specific.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,720
Maybe you're looking for [INAUDIBLE] in every camera frame, and once

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,230
you detect, it shows face then you say

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,930
it what? This guy is a suspicious individual, let's

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,740
track him as he moves around. So, the

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,710
tracking is taking a particular object of interest for

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,970
the domain and asking the question What is

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,930
happening to that object as time moves on. And

12
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,490
in the process of tracking, you are recognizing who

13
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,570
that person is. If there are multiple people in

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,780
a particular alignment, your recognizing the specific

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,400
individual that you may be interested in.

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,910
And if that individual is recognized, then

17
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,530
perhaps you want to raise an alarm. So, this

18
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,480
is just a simple pipeline of tasks to illustrate what a domain expert may be

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:17,310
doing in a video analytics application. So such a domain expert is an expert in

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,900
writing detection algorithms, tracking algorithms, and. Recognition

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,100
algorithms so that they can process the video stream in

22
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,310
real time to generate alarms. So the objective in Situation

23
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,980
Awareness applications is to process these streams of data

24
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,800
for high level inference. In other words, we're not watching a

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,550
YouTube video, but we're using the sensor

26
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,440
streams to derive high level inferences to

27
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,070
what is happening in the enlighnment. And that's what is the nature of Situation

28
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,270
Awareness applications. As I mentioned Video Analytics

29
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,400
is in the purview of a domain

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,830
expert like a vision researcher or a

31
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,080
developer, who knows how to write sophisticated

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,480
detection, tracking, and recognition algorithms. But how

33
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,430
do we scale that up to thousands of

34
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,830
cameras? If an object is moving from one

35
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,170
camera to another, these are the kinds of

36
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,360
things that the domain expert. For Situation

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,610
Awareness may have to worry about, this is

38
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,420
where systems can come in with programming models

39
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,290
that alleviate the pain points of a domain

40
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,480
expert developing Situation Awareness applications. Persistent temporal

41
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,510
streams, which is the focal point of

42
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,460
this particular lesson. Is just one exemplar

43
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,260
of a distributed programming system for catering

44
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,280
to the needs of situation awareness applications. Such as, what I described

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,290
to you, just now. I want to stress the fact that PTS is just an exemplar,

46
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,510
not the last word. But it is good to look at one concrete example of

47
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,950
a distributive programming system that can help reduce

48
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,630
the pain points in developing Situational Awareness Applications.
