1
00:00:05,424 --> 00:00:06,481
Cool.

2
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:11,700
So, I've gone ahead and put together a little bit of a website.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,510
It may not look like much because it was made with Legos but

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,240
it's actually following the same principles that we're learning in this class.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,950
This green piece in the background represents the browser window.

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,710
We can see that the browser here is actually a little bit wider than the page.

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,170
Remember a lot of websites like to center themselves in the page.

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,660
So they have content that fits a certain amount of space.

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,090
And if your browser is wider than that,

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,050
well there's just a little bit of space left over.

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,370
And that's okay.

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,320
But we have a lot of options for the way we want to lay out our content.

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,210
It could be in just one long big column like this that takes up

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,860
the entire width.

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,140
Or it could be two half columns you know, 50-50.

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,510
Or why not break it into thirds like we have here?

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,990
Or even smaller pieces, in this case it's broken into six.

18
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,220
We could do a very popular design where we have one narrow column and

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,340
then one wide column.

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,470
Or we could just do some kind of other crazy design that

21
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,910
doesn't really follow any of these patterns.

22
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,070
The point being is that what we want to do is build a grid system that gives us

23
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,250
the flexibility to make any of the column designs that you see here.

24
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,620
Let's start thinking about how to implement Responsive Design using CSS.

25
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,660
In order for a website to resize based on the size of the browser, we're not

26
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,850
going to be able to use a fixed pixel size to determine the width of columns.

27
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,160
Instead we'll have to use percentages to decide how wide our columns should be.

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,190
Once again, we're back on the reddit homepage.

29
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,420
And let's see if we can make this column on the right responsive instead of

30
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,270
keeping it at a fixed width.

31
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,780
I'm going to go ahead and right click on it.

32
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,070
Anywhere in here and hit Inspect Element to pull up the console.

33
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,050
Aha, and we can see that the element of the class side is the side bar.

34
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,110
we can see it highlighted right here.

35
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,360
Let's see if we can change its width.

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,390
I'll come over here and scroll down.

37
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,020
We find the CSS property called width and currently it's set to 300 pixels.

38
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,060
Remember, you can change websites using DevTools, so let's go ahead and

39
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,400
change this one right now.

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,800
I'll double click and instead of 300 pixels, I'm going to set it to 24%.

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,060
And the reason I'm doing 24% is 300 pixels is

42
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,677
actually 24% of this screen's resolution that you're looking at.

43
00:02:17,677 --> 00:02:20,950
So 24% keeps this column at the same size.

44
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,520
I'll press Enter and it looks the same.

45
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,570
Let me get rid of Dev Tools.

46
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,280
So now I'm going to resize the screen, but this column on the right

47
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,960
is actually going to resize responsively instead of staying at a fixed width.

48
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,870
This time, when we made the screen smaller,

49
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,080
we see that this column got smaller as well.

50
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,370
It didn't stay at the same size because we used a percentage to

51
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,680
define its width.

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,380
It's pretty common to see websites with grid systems that allow for

53
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,440
either two, three, or four columns.

54
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,660
As well as websites that use one narrow column and then one wide column.

55
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,450
Which in this case, would take up the other three.

56
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,910
The Udacity homepage, for

57
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,290
example, uses four columns to highlight our featured courses.

58
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,260
If you go to our course catalog,

59
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,950
you'll notice that we have one narrow column and then one wide column.

60
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,750
This one takes up about a quarter of the screen,

61
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,270
while this guy takes up the other three quarters.

62
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,240
On the Coursera home page, you'll see an example of three columns.

63
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,280
They've got their courses laid out in three even columns.

64
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,260
Which of the following grid sizes is going to allow for

65
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,290
just enough customization?

66
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,230
Meaning that we'll be able to get those common two, three,

67
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,780
four column wide screens and have enough flexibility to do them however we

68
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,550
want without adding overhead of columns that we're never going to use.

69
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,875
Do you think five columns is enough?

70
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,720
8 columns, 12 columns or

71
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,200
do you think that we need 20 columns to get the customization we need?
