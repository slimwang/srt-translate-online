1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,500
Here's a few latitudes and

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,170
longitudes that you can use
when you're building your app.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,200
The Seattle latitude and
longitude I used is this one.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,390
The Dublin one that I used is this one,
and I've added a new one here for

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,500
New York.

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,930
So if you prefer to zoom in
on New York instead of Tokyo,

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,090
here's the latitude and
longitude for that.

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,470
Or if you want to use Tokyo, see if you
can remember the technique that I showed

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,110
in an earlier video on how to get
latitude and longitude for yourself.

10
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,350
When you're done building
the application, check this box.
