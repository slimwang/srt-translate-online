1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So, here is the answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The second substring is actually being handled exactly like the first substring.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If its test fails, then we go into simplify this substring instead.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If neither substring fails, then we return the original string.
