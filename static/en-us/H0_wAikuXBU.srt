1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,370
So it's going to be your task, to add

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,680
a task to send a confirmation email. The first thing

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,500
you need to do is add the sendConfirmationEmail servlet

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,280
to your project. And it goes in the servlet package.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,630
You can get the servlet completely fully coded from

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,130
the Lesson 5 folder, or you can write it yourself

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,320
as you like. And then you need to make

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,820
sure you configure your send confirmation email servlet in web.xml.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,300
Then you need to update the create conference function

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,550
in conference API. You need to add the functionality to

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,190
add the task, to the task queue when ever

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,160
anybody creates a conference. And if you like you can

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,570
also update this function to use transactions so that

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,900
the profile and the conference entities get saved together and

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,840
the task gets added to the Task queue, and that

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,880
all happens inside a transaction or none of it happens.

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,430
And you can get the template code, to add to

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,220
create conference from the lesson five folder, if you want or

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,130
you can try writing it yourself from scratch. So you can

20
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:05,560
optionally put the code, to create the conference inside a transaction.

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,260
When you add the task to the queue in createConference()

22
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,730
function, you can use the default queue or you can use

23
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,230
a named queue, it's up to you. But if you use

24
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,140
a named queue, you need to make sure to configure the

25
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,160
queue in queue.xml. You can also use the default

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,700
queue that configure it to use other options like change

27
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,520
the rate, or change the retry options. And again,

28
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,700
if you want to do that, you need to configure

29
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,000
it in queue.xml. In that case you would just

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,820
add a queue name default to queue.xml. So the development

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,380
server running on local hosts does not send emails, it

32
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,290
does add tasks to queues and actually has it's own

33
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,940
simple task queue viewer, but it won't actually send an email. So

34
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,200
if you to test the sending of emails you're going to need

35
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,170
to deploy your application to appspot. So when you've done testing it

36
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,590
on local host as much as you can, go ahead and deploy it

37
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,270
to app spot. And then to test it of course you're going

38
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,700
to need to create a new conference, and then check your e-mail

39
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,190
to make sure that the e-mail arrived. Did you get an e-mail?

40
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,700
And then go ahead and explore your test queues in the admin console.

41
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,710
So check off each of these steps as you do them
