1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,810
This course is also really built
around the idea of mentorship.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,160
We have a team of TAs, but
more than teaching assistants and

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,875
more than graders,

4
00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:10,460
they're really meant to be mentors for
you as you go through this course.

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,060
Every mentor will have a small group of
students that they'll interact with on

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:13,940
a weekly basis.

7
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,420
You'll have the same mentor
review all your assignments,

8
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,960
review your project proposal.

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,090
Review all your status
reports on that project and

10
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,040
review the final deliverable.

11
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,000
They're really meant to get
a familiarity with your interests,

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,430
your project idea, and your progress.

13
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,790
In fact,
when we reach the end of the semester,

14
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,380
if you decide to keep your project going
as a research agenda or a startup,

15
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,420
I wouldn't be surprised if your
mentor even became a partner for you.
