00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,642
However, it is important to note that the symptoms of schizophrenia differ

2
00:00:03,642 --> 00:00:07,872
person by person. And that includes the combination of symptoms they

3
00:00:07,872 --> 00:00:12,864
experience, as well as the severity of the symptoms and their duration. That

4
00:00:12,864 --> 00:00:16,283
said, sometimes schizophrenia is a chronic condition and the person is

5
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:21,256
constantly experiencing hallucinations and delusions. However, other times

6
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:25,084
people experience periods where they are somewhat symptom free, but

7
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:31,598
occasionally have periods of a more acute form of psychosis. Therefore, each

8
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:34,926
individual is different and will experience the symptoms of the disorder in

9
00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:36,500
different ways.
