1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,520
So, we have a good set of user
feedback in the empty list case.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,150
But it would be nice to have this
also reflected in the settings

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,300
part of the app.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,020
Since the material design specifications
specifically says if the summary for

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,950
the preference can be used
the preference status,

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,350
we're going to add some status
here about the location.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,280
We'll show the status of the preference,

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,520
followed by the value of
the preference in parentheses.

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,660
Just like in the forecast fragment.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,700
We can take advantage of
an OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,010
to update the settings UI as
the sync adapter changes the state.
