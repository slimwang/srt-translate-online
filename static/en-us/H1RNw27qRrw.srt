00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's the interesting finding.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Because type As are so much more popular,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
your chances of linking to a type A is 0.8.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
To see, let's take the extreme view.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Suppose type Bs had 0 friends.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Then you'd never link to a type B.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You link to type A and to type B in a proportion of 80 to 20.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Type B would be 0.2.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That means most of your friends you link to are type A.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
They're the type of people that happen to be popular.
