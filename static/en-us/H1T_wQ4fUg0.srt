1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,580
Okay, so first of all, open a simple
project with a single scene.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,669
Now, let's add a few labels.

3
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:10,279
Later on we'll put
them into a stack view.

4
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:12,719
However, since stack
views are invisible,

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,359
let's give our labels different
backgrounds and font sizes.

6
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,980
Now, in order to put them into stack
view, first select the labels.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,750
And then click on this button
on the auto layout bar.

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,065
And yes, I know that there are many
other mysterious buttons in here.

9
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:32,320
We'll get to them at the right time.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,899
For now, let's just spec those labels.

11
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:38,019
Okay, so what on earth just happened?

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,260
All the sizes changed.

13
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,539
Is this a bug?

14
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,600
Did Auto Layout go crazy?

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,079
No.

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:44,949
Let's step back and

17
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,219
try to think what happens when you
add a bunch of views to a stack.

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,310
The first and last views are anchored
to the left and right side.

19
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,770
Both views are resized to
their intrinsic content view.

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,600
That's why their size is changed.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,280
The rest are distributed
along the remaining space

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,620
according to the distribution algorithm
and the space property if present.

23
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,760
In the next video, we'll play around
with some of the properties of

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,130
stack view that allows us
to modify its behavior.
