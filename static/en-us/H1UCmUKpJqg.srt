1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And here is my solution.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
First, I define an XOR function to XOR two-byte arrays together

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
because that's not included in the library.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Next, we'll loop through the plaintext array.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And here we break it into block-sized pieces,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
which then gets XORed and then fed into the encoder.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The encoder output is then saved as the XOR for the input on the next round.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The encoder output is then saved as the XOR

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
for the next loop and also added to the cipher output.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And finally, the cipher is returned.
