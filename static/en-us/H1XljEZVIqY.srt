1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,600
At this point we've defined all
of the transitions we need for

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,160
our state machine, but
now how do we control them?

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,290
This is where parameters kick in.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,200
If we look at the top left
of our animator window,

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,690
you'll see there's a tab for
layers and parameters.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,540
Let's click on parameters.

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,640
In short, a parameter is basically
a value that we can use to indicate

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,140
when a transition should occur.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,852
If we click on the plus icon we'll
see that there are four types,

10
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:31,890
float, int, bool and trigger.

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,352
If you're familiar with coding float,
int, and

12
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:40,100
bool are all variable types and
they can all take on different values.

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,955
As a quick recap, floats represent
decimals, ints represent real numbers,

14
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:50,470
and bools represent the values true or
false.

15
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,940
Separate from those is the trigger which
is what we're interested in right now.

16
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,998
The trigger is like a bool in
that it's either true or false.

17
00:00:57,998 --> 00:01:03,200
The core difference is that you set
a trigger to become active or true.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,420
And once the transition occurs the
trigger is automatically deactivated, or

19
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,810
set to false.

20
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,210
In our scene we want to use the trigger
to switch between the clock hand

21
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,330
rotating clockwise versus
counter clockwise.

22
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:23,480
To do this let's hit the plus button and
select trigger, let's call it reverse.

23
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,410
Now we need to tell our
transitions to use the trigger

24
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,430
parameter that we just created.

25
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,190
Let's click on a transition and
then look up the inspector.

26
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,720
In the inspector we'll see
a section called conditions.

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,490
Lets go ahead and click the plus button.

28
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,790
When we do that it'll automatically
add our reverse trigger parameter

29
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,270
as a condition since we will
only have one parameter to find.

30
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,660
If we had more than one,

31
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:52,230
we could click this drop down to choose
which trigger we would want to use.

32
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,010
Let's also add the trigger
parameter to our other transition.

33
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,958
Now let's undock the animator so
that we can see our scene view, and

34
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,351
then hit play to run it.

35
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:05,298
[BLANK_AUDIO]

36
00:02:05,298 --> 00:02:09,086
We can now manually activate our trigger
to switch between our hand going in

37
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:12,530
the clockwise direction versus
the counterclockwise direction.

38
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,840
Now you might notice the transition
doesn't take effect immediately.

39
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,350
This is because on our transitions
unity defaults to waiting for

40
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,980
the animation to fully complete.

41
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,840
We can turn this off by
clicking on a transition and

42
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,640
disabling the has exit time.

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,460
Let's do that on both transitions.

44
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,460
And now if we do that we'll instantly
transition when we click the trigger.
