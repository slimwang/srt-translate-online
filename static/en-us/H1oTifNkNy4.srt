00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,107
In order to find out where this curve hits the x-axis, we need to set y equal to

2
00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:08,289
0. Then we can say that this will be satisfied if one of two conditions is true.

3
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:12,455
We could either have the first factor equaling 0, which gives us the equation x

4
00:00:12,455 --> 00:00:17,025
plus 3 minus the root of 6 equals 0. Or we could have the second factor equals

5
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:21,542
0, x plus 3 plus root of 6 equals 0. Now we just solve for x. This gives us x

6
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:26,204
equals negative 3 plus the root of 6, and x equals negative 3 minus the root of

7
00:00:26,204 --> 00:00:30,890
6. So if x equals either of these numbers, this expression will equal 0. These

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,776
are just the x-coordinates of our two x-intercepts, and of course the

9
00:00:34,776 --> 00:00:38,801
y-coordinate of each is 0. So this is actually really incredible what we've

10
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:43,028
done. We figure out how to factor over not just the integers but over the real

11
00:00:43,028 --> 00:00:46,939
numbers. In other words, we can use completing the square and understanding

12
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:50,899
difference of squares to find the x-intercepts of a ton of different equations

13
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:55,040
for parabolas, not just ones that we can factor in the traditional way. Oh, and

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,641
I almost forgot. The rounded version of these two answers are negative .55, 0

15
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:05,759
and negative 5.44, 0. We're going to keep working with the idea of finding

16
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:11,372
x-intercepts of any given parabola in the next lesson. Awesome job on a lot of

17
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:13,678
pretty complicated material.
