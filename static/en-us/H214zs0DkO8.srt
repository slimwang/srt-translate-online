00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,160
Let me show you some simple examples of Arithmetic Blend Modes.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,310
For example, I can do a divide, which lets me brighten photographs.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,720
I can take two pixels of information from each one of them and

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,050
do some sort of division and then scale them up again.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,970
I can do addition, and we've seen examples of this in

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,610
our lecture where I've taken two images and just added them together.

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,150
In this case, rather than looking at images from the values of zero to 255,

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,590
let's assume they're from zero to one.

9
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,240
And if I have two images over pixels with more than value one,

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,850
they'll all become white.

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,890
And in this simple addition we'll let that be the case so it,

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,020
of course, makes the image have too many whites.

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,390
Subtract is again something we've looked at.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,490
And in this case again for

15
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,230
the range of zero to one, and we subtract, we get a lot of values below zero.

16
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,400
And of course we just replace them by zero, and

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,660
of course this image shows a lot of blacks.

18
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,760
A most important type, and

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,730
again we see an example of this is when we do a difference.

20
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,360
But we do subtract but whenever we get to zero we kind of do a scaling up

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,120
to make sure all of the range of values between zero and one are covered.

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,660
The more wildly used simple blend mode is that of darken which is

23
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,870
shown by this equation here.

24
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:16,200
Which basically takes the minimum of the pixel value from the top and

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,120
the bottom layers for each and every color channel, R, G, and B.

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,410
In essence, what darken does, it creates a new novel image

27
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:29,000
that creates basically represents each and every pixel that retains

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,540
the smallest component of the foreground and the background pixels.

29
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,980
Smallest meaning, of course, the darker.

30
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,810
And therefore of course it's referred to as darken.

31
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,450
It actually starts giving you more of the darker pixels that's a combination of

32
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,430
both and of course finds the lowest value between both of them.

33
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,690
On the other hand lighten does the opposite.

34
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,700
Where it basically takes the maximum value.

35
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,190
Basically it attempts to select the maximum of both the top and

36
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,640
the bottom layers in RGB and

37
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,960
showcases that and actually allows you to see a much more lighter image.

38
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,490
Again, I encourage you to try these types of things out on your own.
