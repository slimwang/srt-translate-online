00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,420
Now, let's get familiar with some of

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,650
the abstractions provided by an operating system. I'm

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,840
sure that you may have heard several different

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,800
terms used in the context of an operating

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:18,060
system such as program or a process or a thread and task and so on. Let's

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,440
understand these terms. A program is the memory

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,990
footprint that is created when you click on

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:31,920
an icon to launch an application on your favorite platform. So it is a static

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,810
image of the program loaded into the memory. A process, on the other

10
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:44,980
hand, is a program in execution. That is, the operating system, breathes life

11
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:51,290
into the program, which is a static entity, by running the program on the CPU.

12
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,180
That is, by scheduling the program to run on the processor, the operating system

13
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,630
gives life to the program and the

14
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,440
process is the program in execution. Therefore a

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:09,700
process is the program plus the state of the running program. And yes, the state

16
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,050
of the running program is not static.

17
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,220
It is continuously evolving as the program executes.

18
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:22,070
So these are the two important abstractions related to the process and program.

19
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:27,290
Which is a static entity created by the operating system when

20
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,540
you launch a program. And process is the program in execution.
