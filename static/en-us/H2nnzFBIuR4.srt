00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,910
We live in a multi-device world, and
many of our users have cell phones,

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,320
tablets, laptops, and more.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,950
When using Google Sign-In,

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,070
one of the neat benefits is that
when you've authorized the app once,

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,724
you've authorized it on every
device that your user has.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,720
So if I install and run the app on my
phone, then when I go to my tablet,

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,070
I can log in straightaway
without authorizing it again.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,240
Let's see how this works
