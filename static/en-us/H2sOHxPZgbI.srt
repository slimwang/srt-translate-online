1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,080
That concludes EHR certification.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,390
The other two components of high
tech are meaningful use and

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,090
incentive payments.

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,830
Before we discuss them,

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,340
we'll have a basic overview of
electronic medical records.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,340
Physicians are in the data business.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,870
They collect data.

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,940
They make treatment decisions
based on that data.

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,130
And they follow patients through other
data and make adjustments as needed.

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:31,130
The data physicians record can be
divided into subjective information,

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,380
generally information collected from the
patient, such as the chief complaint,

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,130
the reason they visited the physician
today, their medical history, and

13
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,740
history of the particular problem
that brought them to the doctor.

14
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,320
Physicians may collect objective
data by doing a physical exam,

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,060
ordering X-rays or rather images,
or doing lab tests.

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,370
The resulting data can be in many forms.

17
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,830
It can be free text.

18
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,870
It can be structured codes,
such as the ICD we referred to earlier.

19
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,780
Could be continuous wave forms
from an electrocardiogram, images,

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,330
sound recordings, or even videos.

21
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,400
Increasingly data from
chronic disease and

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,460
other patients may be coming from
their smart phone or from physiologic

23
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,660
measurement devices they use to
track their own health at home.

24
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,600
Storing and presenting this rich data
set is an EMR design challenge, yet

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,310
many EMRs still mimic the organization
of the paper chart, even simulating

26
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,030
the tabs that divide the sections
where the data types are stored.

27
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,060
Despite its key role in medicine,
physicians have historically focused far

28
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,620
more on collecting the right data than
they have on recording it completely,

29
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,099
accurately, and legibly.

30
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,860
As we've seen, in a fragmented system
of care where many physicians treat

31
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,860
aspects of a single patient's care,
this can lead to duplicate testing or

32
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,460
even errors.

33
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,250
Here's a particularly dramatic example.

34
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,450
For which medication was
this prescription written?

35
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,890
What is Isordil, Plendil,
or are you not sure?
