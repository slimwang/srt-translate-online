1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,550
Here's a very simple app that
has a map embedded within it.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,610
It doesn't have visual controls along
the map that allow me to do things such

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,950
as zoom in and out.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,520
But I can actually pinch
the map if I want to zoom.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,500
Here you can see I'm zooming in, and
here you can see I'm zooming out.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,390
It also has data such as country names,
you can see here the United States

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,010
country name as well as the states
in the United States and cities.

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,660
And also here we can see
Mexico is a country name.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,010
So a lot of the data is already
available on this map for me and

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,910
I'll show shortly how I built this and
it was very, very simple,

11
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,910
very straightforward, and effectively
getting all of this data for free.

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,400
If I zoom in on a specific location,
like right now I'm going to zoom in

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,320
on the Silicon Valley area, and
we begin to see town names.

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,520
And if I get in even closer
we'll begin to see street names.

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,980
Here you can see West El Camino Real.

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,300
We can see Latham Street.

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,850
This is right here where I'm recording,
and

18
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,750
if I zoom even closer we'll begin
to see individual buildings.

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,520
And here we can see buildings appearing.

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,000
Across the road from
here is a shopping mall.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,760
And, actually some building when,
I zoom right into them,

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,180
I begin to see some of the details
of the interior of the building.

23
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,090
So here we can see I have a department
store very close to me, and

24
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,780
I'm beginning to see the sections within
the department store Including the fact

25
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,830
that they put the bakery right
beside the intimate apparel.

26
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,870
Now, all of this data came with the maps
without me having to write anything.

27
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,090
I just added the map to an Android
app with a default customization.

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,020
It's very, very simple to do.

29
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,820
And in the next few minutes, you're
actually going to build this exact app,

30
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,850
and it will give you the foundation for
building much more complex and

31
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,730
interesting mapping apps
later in this course.

32
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,490
So let's get started.
