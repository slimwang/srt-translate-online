1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,184
3x is our greatest common factor, and if we factored it out we would be left

2
00:00:04,184 --> 00:00:08,980
with this expression. Amazing algebra skills if you got that right. This will be

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,146
the prime factorization for these three terms. We can see that 3x would be the

4
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:17,795
greatest common factor. If we multiply what's remaining we'll get 12x squared

5
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:22,248
for the first term, negative 5x for the second term, and negative 2 for the

6
00:00:22,248 --> 00:00:23,063
third term.
