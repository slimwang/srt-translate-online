1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
And actually, just this one here is correct.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,470
The other 2 are not correct,

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,480
and as I told you, the conditions for a spanning tree are

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,120
first, it can contain no cycles.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,130
and actually here, we have a cycle,

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,329
so this can not be a spanning tree.

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,040
And over here,

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,330
we said that a spanning tree must still keep the whole graph connected,

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,560
so all vertices connected to each other,

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,900
and this is not the case here,

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,890
so here, we have basically split the graph into 2 parts.

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,520
Here is 1 part and here is the other part.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is also not a spanning tree.
