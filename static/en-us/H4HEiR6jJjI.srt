Just like with the z and t statistics, we want one statistic that describes

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:07,450
these variances in relation to each other, and determines whether or not we

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:13,794
accept or reject the null hypothesis. First of all, what do you think the null

4
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:18,376
and alternate hypotheses will be when we're doing ANOVA? Let's just say we're

5
00:00:18,376 --> 00:00:22,655
comparing three samples. Do you think it's this group, this group, or this

6
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:23,840
group?
