00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,060
My name is Brent Beer.

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,730
I'm one of the trainers here at GitHub.

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,600
Which usually entails sometimes doing online classes.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,520
Classes in person.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,920
Or sometimes, with Enterprise customers doing private courses, as well.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,130
So, one of the things that confuses people, often, when they first start is,

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,610
well, I know, I've heard about Git and I've heard about GitHub.

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,900
You know? What is the difference between the two?

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,070
And Git, itself, being the version control tool that GitHub is built on.

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:32,080
So, Git is largely the thing that will be interacting with on the laptop.

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,070
Doing that local work first and as soon as we use a few choice commands and

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,230
send things up to GitHub that's when it's more the social component or

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,340
it's in it's network, it's in a cloud if you wanted to use that term as well.

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,975
So Git is local.

15
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:49,660
GitHub is where we share and collaborate with other people.

16
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,920
The reason why I like pull request is because it allows us to, really get

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,940
that work that we're wanting to, kind of, work on, and complete that feature.

18
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,840
And allow us to collaborate with other people just to show them our work.

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,700
Get feedback on it.

20
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,790
So that we can have people kind of working with us as they choose to or

21
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,550
as we want to pull other people into the work itself.

22
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,940
When GitHub started you know, a few years ago kind of a, as a out of a need for

23
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,630
the Ruby community to have ways to kind of share their code and collaborate.

24
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,890
It's expanded past that and now, you know, a lot more open source communities

25
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,940
and languages have, you know, grown within GitHub and the GitHub ecosystem.

26
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,350
So, GitHub helped the open source community and, and

27
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,790
helped make it a little bit better by allowing us to have this centralized place

28
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,240
where we can talk about any features that we're wanting to work on.

29
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,620
Any problems that we might have as we decide to share code around or

30
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,840
incorporate code into other projects so

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,850
it helps the communities kind of have that place where they can pull together,

32
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,850
talk about their new features and work through problems together.

33
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,490
In fact, the node community itself is one of the larger communities that

34
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,910
first started out after GitHub was already around.

35
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,030
So, they were able to flourish as a community, whereas other communities maybe

36
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,010
were older and came to GitHub later and then grew from there.
