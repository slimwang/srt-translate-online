00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,910
The specific objectives of this lesson are for

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,980
you to learn about how we can detect features in an image.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,840
We will specifically be looking at edges in a image and why are edges

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,810
important and how they represent the information that's available in an image.

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,510
We would look at those within the context of how we can compute image

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,290
gradients and how we can actually use the computation of image gradients to

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,850
support computation of edges.

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,280
I will also give you a little bit of an, a background on how we

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,280
can actually compute those image gradients, in a mathematical form for

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,960
both doing continuous functions and also discreet forms of images
