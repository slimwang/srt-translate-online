00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,900
What's a vision statement and
how do you get started writing one for

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,170
your business?

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,360
A vision statement is a declaration
of your company objectives,

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,240
meant to provide guidance
on the decisions you make.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,850
Basically, it's the big dream
that you have for your business.

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,770
You can think of it as the Northstar for
your company.

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,190
It helps provide inspiration about what
your business is focused on achieving

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,850
throughout its lifetime.

9
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,230
There's a few basic questions
that a vision statement should

10
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,580
be able to answer.

11
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,200
Try focusing on questions like these.

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,610
What will your business become if
everything goes according to plan?

13
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,270
Why do you exist?

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,900
And how will your business
change the world?

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,040
You don't want to state specific
ways you go about doing this yet,

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,550
just focus on the overarching goal that
you as a business plan to work towards.

17
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,390
And finally,

18
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,260
it's important to consider how long
your vision statement might need to be.

19
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,830
There's really no set length for
a vision statement, but

20
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,950
there's a few guidelines you
can follow to help write yours.

21
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,080
You want to make sure you have enough
information to provide a sense of

22
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,830
purpose, a call to action and
an idea of your final destination.

23
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,110
You don't want it to be so
long that it's difficult to understand.

24
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,560
But making it too short can also leave
out the kind of meaning it will need to

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,830
actually guide your business.

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,860
One line vision statements
are possible but

27
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,700
you could have a full paragraph
if that's what it takes.

28
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,000
Just consider that if you want
people to actually read and

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,900
remember this, then brief can be better.

30
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,530
Don't be so
broad that you sound generic, but not so

31
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,910
specific that it won't be
relevant after a couple years.

32
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,940
For example,

33
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,350
Google's vision is to provide access to
the world's information in one click.

34
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,880
Do you notice how their vision focuses
on a bold claim about the overarching

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,710
goal they have for their business?

36
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,740
Try doing the same for yours.

37
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,950
So, consider some of these ideas and

38
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,700
look into some of the examples of vision
statements created by other companies.

39
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,510
Once you feel comfortable with
the purpose of a vision statement,

40
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,750
try thinking of one that you
could use for your business.
