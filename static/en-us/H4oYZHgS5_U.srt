Here is a different function and I've labelled it g of x. Functions don't have

2
00:00:05,369 --> 00:00:10,484
to always use the letter f. We often use the letter as f, g, and h, because it's

3
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:15,534
the convention for algebra. So using this function, I want you to find these

4
00:00:15,534 --> 00:00:19,689
outputs g of 3, g of 0, g of negative 2, and g of 4. And be careful when

5
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:20,969
squaring your input.
