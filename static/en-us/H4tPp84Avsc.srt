1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,340
What do you think, David?

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,380
What are the deep similarities here?

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,120
>> So, I picked that three of
these are deep similarities.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,410
In both there's something
revolving around something else.

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,740
The planet revolving around the sun and

6
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,950
the electron revolving
around the nucleus.

7
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,110
In both,
there's a force between two objects.

8
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,820
A force between the sun and
the planet, and

9
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,510
a force between a nucleus and
an electron.

10
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,670
And in both,
two objects attract each other.

11
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,150
All three of these
are based on relationships.

12
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,210
The revolution,
the force between two objects and

13
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,520
the attraction between two objects.

14
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,190
I didn't pick the other three
because while these two are true,

15
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,420
they don't represent deep relationships.

16
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,729
And while this is actually true,

17
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,250
it's not actually captured
in our representation.

18
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,280
So this isn't part of our knowledge
base for the purpose of this problem.

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,970
Now we can see why the textbooks
write about this solar system and

20
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,410
the atomic structure in such a way that
these relationships become salient.

21
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,530
They help us make sense of the atomic
structure, but pointing to the deep

22
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,630
similarities between the relationship
that are occurring with the atomic

23
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,320
structure and the relationship that
are occurring in the solar system
