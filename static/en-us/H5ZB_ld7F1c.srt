1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,540
Even though technically Objective-C
is a statically typed language,

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:10,010
it sneaks in more flexibility in
typing through the use of the type ID.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,870
ID as you'll remember is like
saying to be determined or

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,210
this object can be of any type.

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,460
At runtime a more specific
type is determined.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,290
Delegates generally have type ID as
well as objects inside of arrays.

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,500
When Swift is consuming
Objective-C code,

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,280
objects of type id are given
the type any object.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,240
An object of type any object
can hold a variety of types.

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,670
Although your code may work if
you allow objects of type ID

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,150
to be imported as objects of type any
object., it's not really in the spirit

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,900
of Swift development to allow for
such flexible types.

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,020
Not to mention,
any object can leave you vulnerable to

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,460
unrecognized selector errors when
you're dealing with untyped arrays.

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,900
Let's take a look at an example.

16
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,730
Here's a Backpack class
written in Objective- C.

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,260
And you can see it has a property called
Keys which holds an NSMutableArray.

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,100
This example project also has a class
called Key which implements the method

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,800
openDoor.

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,320
Here's some Swift Code that's
using the Backpack class.

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,550
First, we instantiate
a Backpack instantiated

22
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,390
Key to represent her house key and
then add that key to the backpack.

23
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,690
So far so good, now let's take
the Key out of the Backpack and

24
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,470
try to open the door.

25
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,570
The code above compiles fine but
when we press run we've got a problem.

26
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,140
So, let's go down to the console and
see if we can see what's going on.

27
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,075
We have to scroll up to the top.

28
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:43,030
Okay,what have we got.

29
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:48,060
Unrecognized selectors sent to
instants and a bunch of numbers.

30
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,350
What's this about a string.

31
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,460
If we look again at
the Backpack class we can see

32
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,570
the first object in
the array as an API key.

33
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,451
So, it doesn't implement
the method openDoor.

34
00:02:01,451 --> 00:02:04,570
OpenDoor is the unrecognized selector.
