1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,460
Well, you can e, easily think about it this way.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,650
Let's define a rigid body as just a collection of points whose

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,880
relative positions to each other can't change.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,510
And, for the mathematicians in the audience,

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,400
we're going to pretend that's a well-defined statement, okay?

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,380
Or, you can think of it as a box.

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,120
So, the first thing I can do is I can located that box in 3D.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,990
I can take one point of that box,

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,330
say the corner here, and figure out the x, y and z location of that box.

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,080
So, that's three degrees of freedom.

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,820
Then, I can take some other point on that box,

12
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,310
let's say the corner, and I can move it around.

13
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,800
Now, I can't change it's location space arbitrarily because I'm

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,970
holding this point fixed.

15
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,740
So, essentially, this corner can move around on the sphere.

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,130
So, this point here can be moved around anywhere on the sphere.

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,850
So rot, this is supposed to be like rotated backwards this way, all right?

18
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,950
And just the way you can think of on a globe.

19
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,460
From the middle, there's a latitude and longitude to get any location.

20
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,100
There's two degrees of freedom of a vector's direction.

21
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,920
So, that's another two degrees of freedom.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,920
So, we're up to five.

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,900
And finally, once I have this vector specified, I can rotate,

24
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,980
I can spin about that vector.

25
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,150
So, the cube here, as indicated by this fancy Microsoft PowerPoint arrow that's

26
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,950
in here, we can rotate it about that diagonal.

27
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,830
So, that's one more degree of freedom.

28
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,850
So, that's why there are six degrees of freedom for a rigid body.

29
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,680
I'm going to assume most of you knew that already, but there you go.

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,040
That's why there's a fast forward button.
