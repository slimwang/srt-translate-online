00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,200
Great!

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,780
You've just implemented the work
horse of a very complex and

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,960
powerful design pattern,
the IntentService.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,200
To learn about intents and
how android uses them for

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,260
a synchronized functionality, check back
to the android fundamentals courses.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,600
They will make you a better developer.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,650
Now that you've built the service,

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,290
you'll need to build the activity
that calls the service.

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,860
Remember earlier we saw it.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,290
You'd press a button and

11
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,140
various activity types will
appear on your screen.

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,730
Well that's what's next on your list,
so let's get coding.
