00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,547
Now that we've done some interest problems, let's try a mixture one. Mixture

2
00:00:03,547 --> 00:00:07,075
problems like this are helpful if you're at home and you want to make lemonade

3
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:10,755
or punch. Usually, you're trying to make a different concentration than what you

4
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:14,187
already have in your fridge. Scientists also use this approach when they're

5
00:00:14,187 --> 00:00:17,926
trying to make different concentrations of chemical solutions in the laboratory.

6
00:00:17,926 --> 00:00:21,986
Let's see how it works. Let's use the same approach as before with rates and

7
00:00:21,986 --> 00:00:26,249
amounts to try and set up equations. The wording is slightly different here

8
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:30,537
because we're working with volumes and percentages, but I think you'll see a

9
00:00:30,537 --> 00:00:35,025
pattern. For this problem we have 5 gallons of a punch mix with 65% water. We

10
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:39,010
want to mix it with a punch mix that's 80% water. So that way we get a mix

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,345
that's 75% water in the end. The question is, how much of this 80% mixture

12
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:47,635
should we use? These are the two equations that we're going to try and set up.

13
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:52,075
The first one takes into the account the gallons of water. For example, the

14
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:56,662
first volume that I have is 5 gallons of punch mix. This punch mix is 65% water.

15
00:00:56,662 --> 00:01:00,877
So if I take my percentage of water and multiply it by the gallons of punch,

16
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:06,372
I'll get my gallons of water. I change 65% to its decimal, and multiply by 5, to

17
00:01:06,372 --> 00:01:11,252
get 3.25 or 3 and 25 hundredths. Remember the question can help us identify the

18
00:01:11,252 --> 00:01:15,569
variable. We don't know how much punch mix we need that's 80%, so I'm going to

19
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:19,895
let that variable be x. Using x, and the information in the problem, I want you

20
00:01:19,895 --> 00:01:24,480
to complete our equation. What should go in these boxes? Mixes. Don't worry

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,262
about volume 3. We actually don't know that quantity yet.
