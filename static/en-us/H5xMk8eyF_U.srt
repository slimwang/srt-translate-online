00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,081
Semantic similarity used with conceptual similarity between the target problem

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:08,555
and the source case. If we recall the original exercise that David had answered,

3
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:12,688
in that exercise, a woman climbing up a ladder is conceptually similar,

4
00:00:12,688 --> 00:00:16,036
semantically similar to a woman climbing up a step ladder.

5
00:00:16,036 --> 00:00:20,270
The same kind of concepts occur in both situations. Woman, and step ladder or

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,630
ladder. Pragmatic similarity concerns with external factors.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,580
Factors external to the presentation, such as goals. As an example,

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,660
in the Dunker radiation problem, the physician had a goal of killing the tumor,

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,087
which was similar to the goal of capturing the fort in case of the rebel army

10
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:43,826
and the king. Pragmatic similarity refers to similarity of external factors,

11
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:48,082
factors external to the representation, such as similarity of goals. The Dunker

12
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:51,900
radiation problem for example, the physician had the goal of killing the tumor,

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,230
which was similar to the goal of capturing the fort in case of the rebel army in

14
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:01,760
the king example. The third measure of similarity is structural similarity.

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,560
Structure here refers to the structure of presentations,

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,070
not to physical structure. Now structural similarity of the first two,

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,640
similarity between the representational structures of the target problem and

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,360
the source case, and we'll look at an example of this in just a few minutes.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,110
Know that one can assign different kinds of weights to these three measures of

20
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:23,500
similarity. So some queries of analogy focus on structural similarity.

21
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,190
Other theories of analogy focus on semantic and

22
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,380
pragmatic similarity. That is also why you may have given slightly different

23
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,420
answers to the questions in the first exercise than David did.
