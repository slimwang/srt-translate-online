00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,126
Here's your second problem using area and perimeter. This time, you want to

2
00:00:04,126 --> 00:00:09,550
construct an enclosed dog run using 46 feet of fencing. If you only have enough

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,330
concrete to cover 120 square feet, what should be the dimensions of your dog

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,572
run? Now, you might not even know what a dog run is, but it's just like a patio

5
00:00:17,572 --> 00:00:22,186
or even a rectangular garden. Try doing some research to find out what the

6
00:00:22,186 --> 00:00:25,654
diagram looks like. Then, see if you can create a diagram to help you problem

7
00:00:25,654 --> 00:00:30,270
solve. When you think you have the length and width, enter them here.
