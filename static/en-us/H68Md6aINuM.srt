00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,800
Now let's do a quiz on the relationship between

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,790
dependencies and hazards. Let's say that we have a

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,310
three-stage pipeline, where here we are fetching and encoding

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,363
the instructions. Here, we are reading the register inputs that

5
00:00:13,363 --> 00:00:15,994
we need and doing the ALU operation. And here

6
00:00:15,994 --> 00:00:18,438
we're accessing the memory and then writing the result

7
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:21,496
to the register. For an ALU operation we just

8
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:25,236
write to the register. Let's say that we have these

9
00:00:25,236 --> 00:00:28,410
four instructions The first one is producing R1, and

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,608
the next three are using it. And I can

11
00:00:30,608 --> 00:00:33,661
tell you that these three dependencies are the only

12
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:37,252
dependencies that exist in this program. The question for

13
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:39,953
you is whether there is a dependence from the

14
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:43,457
add to this instruction, and whether that dependence is

15
00:00:43,457 --> 00:00:47,025
a hazard. Put a check mark into these six

16
00:00:47,025 --> 00:00:50,850
boxes, depending on which one has a dependence, and

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,910
which one of these dependents is a hazard.
