1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,790
Maybe we don't want all of
the listings to appear right away.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,250
We want to let the user chose to show or
hide them all on the click of a button.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,379
First we'll add two buttons,
show listings and

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,520
hide listing and a little bit
more HTML to structure our page.

5
00:00:15,835 --> 00:00:17,984
I also added some CSS
to go with the HTML.

6
00:00:19,315 --> 00:00:23,845
Each button has a unique ID,
show-listings and hide-listings.

7
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:25,864
Let's keep the naming simple here.

8
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:27,414
We'll create an event listener for

9
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:30,820
each button to make some functions
happen when the buttons are clicked.

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,310
Here are our event listeners.

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,826
Clicking the show listings button
calls the showListings function, and

12
00:00:36,826 --> 00:00:41,134
clicking the hide listings button
calls the hideListings function.

13
00:00:41,134 --> 00:00:45,204
Now, in the initialized function, we're
going to keep almost everything else

14
00:00:45,204 --> 00:00:49,037
the same, in that we'll still create
an array of markers on initialize.

15
00:00:49,037 --> 00:00:53,603
However we're not going to set the map
parameter on those markers right away.

16
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:56,817
We also won't extend the bounds
of the map just yet.

17
00:00:56,817 --> 00:01:01,307
Instead we'll move that stuff
into our showListings function.

18
00:01:01,307 --> 00:01:05,310
So the showListings function will
loop through our markers array,

19
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,740
set the map to map on
each of the markers and

20
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:11,129
extend the bounds of the map
to fit each of the markers.

21
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,569
Conversely, we'll create
the hideListings function which

22
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:19,279
loops through our markers array again
and sets the map to null on each marker.

23
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,800
This doesn't delete the markers,
it just hides them.

24
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:25,099
Awesome!

25
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:28,849
Now we have some points on the map,
some interactions with the user, and

26
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:30,109
lots of room for creativity.
