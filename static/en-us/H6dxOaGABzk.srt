00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,380
Well, I've typed this in and all I need to do is hit enter to find out what the

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:11,247
answer is. And we get a value of 9. This makes perfect sense. You know that 7

3
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:15,126
plus 2 is 9. Now, we can try this with other values too. Let's play around. I

4
00:00:15,126 --> 00:00:23,314
could do increase by 2 of 25, let's say. That gives us 27. I could do increase

5
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:29,890
by 2 of negative 17. This time let's make an interesting number like 0.9886.

6
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,774
That gives us 2.9886. Awesome. So, hopefully this is giving you another way at

7
00:00:35,774 --> 00:00:40,100
how functions work. We have three clearly defined things involved in this

8
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,799
program right here. We have the input. The function, which is processing this

9
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:48,683
input. And then the output that the function spits out.
