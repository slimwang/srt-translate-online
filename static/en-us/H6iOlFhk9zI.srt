52 times a half is 26, and then I have 2w plus 6 on the right side. I don't have

2
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:09,289
any multiplication here, this is addition. I'm just adding w to its like term.

3
00:00:09,394 --> 00:00:14,252
Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get 20 equals 2w, then we divide both sides by

4
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:18,950
2, so we're left with 1w is equal to 10. We know the width, but we need to keep

5
00:00:18,962 --> 00:00:23,768
in mind that we still need to find the length. Let's check in with our diagram.

6
00:00:23,868 --> 00:00:28,111
I can replace these w's with 10, so each side is 10 feet. Now, you could have

7
00:00:28,123 --> 00:00:32,518
reasoned your way and figured out the length of l since you know the perimeter

8
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,798
has to add up to 52. Or you could be a little bit more clever. You could just

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,955
say the length of the rectangle is 6 more than the width. So, to find the

10
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:45,355
length, I just have to take the width and add 6, so the length needs to be 16.

11
00:00:45,457 --> 00:00:50,005
And you could, of course, check your answer by finding the perimeter. Add up all

12
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:54,450
the sides and your perimeter should be 52. Hopefully, you use your equation

13
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:56,160
skills and got that one right.
