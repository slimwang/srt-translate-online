00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,480
So far, we've seen how to send data
from Tag Manager to Analytics,

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,390
so it shows up as a screen view.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,200
But what if you want to
track specific events?

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,590
In that case, create a tag, and
set the tracking type to Event.

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,950
Each of these fields corresponds to
a parameter you can set in your code,

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,770
when you send an event hit
directly to Analytics.

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,720
Here's an example of code from our app,
where we sent an event hit to Analytics.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,510
You see that the code sets the Category,
Action, Label.

9
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,390
Now, the Value must be an int, and
we didn't set a value in this case.

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,270
So go ahead and add the code,

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,690
to send an event, every time anyone
clicks the Show Daily Special button.

12
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,220
Previously, we just
sent a screen view hit.

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,320
This time, send an event hit and
set the label to food preference.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,590
So you don't need to create new
triggers or change your code.

15
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,800
And then, as always,
don't forget to publish your changes.

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,048
Start and stop your app and try it out.

17
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,500
If your phone's connected
to Android Studio,

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,350
you can look in the logs to
see if the hits get sent.

19
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,830
And for event hits,
you should see the parameters ec and

20
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,825
in our case, in my case, I set it to
button clicks, but this is a category.

21
00:01:19,825 --> 00:01:23,460
A-n is the application name, language.

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,758
And in this case, t,
which is the hit type, is event.

23
00:01:28,758 --> 00:01:33,310
E-a is the action,
I set mine to Show Daily Special.

24
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,030
And el is the label, so when this got
sent, the food preference was fish.

25
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,580
And check for
activity in the real time screen.
