1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,170
That was awesome.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,494
>> I know. The reason that we showed you guys, the

3
00:00:03,494 --> 00:00:06,789
example of a Porsche to illustrate use, good user experience design.

4
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:09,733
Is because we want to explain that, good user experience should

5
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:12,830
make your users happy, it should make you happy. That's kind of

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,840
the whole point. And UX design is about all of these

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,538
tons of different things coming together. So if every person that

8
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:21,805
made the Porsche if anyone dropped the ball, the UX of

9
00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:25,729
the Porsche wouldn't be awesome. It's, it's all these things coming together

10
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:27,114
that really makes user experience

11
00:00:27,114 --> 00:00:30,300
design, because design is everyone's responsibility.

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,380
>> No, exactly, and I think one of the

13
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,810
important things for, for us as developers to remember

14
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,090
is that, all the things that made that Porsche

15
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,425
amazing, can actually port it directly into the software world.

16
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:40,780
>> Yeah.

17
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,980
>> So let's bring it from the Porsche world,

18
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,380
into the software world. Now, when we're in the software

19
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,850
world, as developers, we think in terms of code. So,

20
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,110
let's look at all the code that we write as

21
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,550
something that goes in this box, and let's say that all

22
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,290
the code, contributes to what's called the user experience, of a particular

23
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,710
application. So now if you, take a little bit closer look at

24
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,050
the chunks of code that we write. Let's say that you have

25
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,490
code, that essentially puts pixels on a screen or interacts with the

26
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,590
user in any way. This could be through audio input or audio

27
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,550
output. Let's say that that is your UI code. Let's say the

28
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,130
rest of the code that you write, stuff for your backend and

29
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,760
so on, the non-visual code, that actually does not

30
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,190
have an impact on the UI, but it does

31
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,910
have a direct and strong impact on the UX.

32
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,090
And that's something that, we should always keep in mind.

33
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,280
>> So, this is basically the difference between

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,350
UI and UX. They're not synonyms, but they

35
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,150
get thrown around a lot so I think

36
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,830
it's important to kind of, disambiguate these two terms.

37
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,450
>> Yeah, exactly. The visual and non-visual code come together

38
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,410
to deliver the user experience for your application, whereas

39
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,860
the visual code almost exclusively delivers the user interface.

40
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,280
>> But the most important thing is that

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,650
he overall UX, should make your users feel happy.

42
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,327
>> Yeah, so think about an applications that's made

43
00:01:54,327 --> 00:01:56,880
you happy. What has blown your mind by delivering

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,200
an awesome user experience? Keep that app in mind,

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,430
because we're going to be using that later on this lesson.
