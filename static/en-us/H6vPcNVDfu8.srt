00:00:00,036 --> 00:00:03,807
Let's take a look at a commonly used kernel in scientific computation.

2
00:00:03,807 --> 00:00:08,103
This is called N-body computation. In an N-body computation you have N objects,

3
00:00:08,103 --> 00:00:11,664
each of which exerts a force on each other object.

4
00:00:11,664 --> 00:00:17,580
You'll use N-body computations to, say, model the gravitational interaction between stars and a galaxy

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,644
or the electrostatic forces between a number of charged particles.

6
00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:25,252
It's the way we compute molecular dynamics, which in turn can model protein folding and misfolding

7
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:28,688
and is an important component of our understanding of disease and drug discovery.

8
00:00:28,688 --> 00:00:31,458
N-body techniques are used in folding at home, for instance.

9
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:36,229
The specific formulation of N-body computation that we'll discuss today is called all-pairs N-body,

10
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:42,703
and I'm basing this discussion on an excellent article by Lars Nyland, Mark Harris, and Jan Prins in 2007 in GPU Gems 3.

11
00:00:42,703 --> 00:00:45,773
All-pairs N-Body is the simplest N-body computation.

12
00:00:45,773 --> 00:00:51,210
It's known as a brute-force method, and it involves separately calculating the force between each pair of elements

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,145
and then adding up the resulting forces on each element.

14
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:57,251
A simulation using N-body will usually have two steps.

15
00:00:57,251 --> 00:01:03,490
First, compute the forces on each element, then move each element a little bit based on its force, and then repeat.

16
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,259
So we first want to understand the complexity of this approach.

17
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:11,164
So we have N objects, each of which computes the forces on it from each other object.

18
00:01:11,164 --> 00:01:15,342
For N objects, what is the work complexity of computing all-pairs N-body?

19
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:19,342
Is the amount of work proportional to N, N log N, N squared, or N cubed?
