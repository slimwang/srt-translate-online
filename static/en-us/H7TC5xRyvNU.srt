I want you to give it a shot.

Open up Google Chrome and
visit your favorite web site.

00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,720
Once you're there, try inspecting the
site to answer the following questions.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,595
What HTML tags are used to
build the content on the page?

5
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:17,375
Are the names of the ID and
class attributes descriptive?

6
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:22,385
Does the website use tag, id, or
class selectors to style their elements?

7
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:25,075
When you're done, click the I'm
ready check-box to continue.
