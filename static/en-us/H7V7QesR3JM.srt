00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,487
The method to find the number of occurrences of any word is going to be pretty

2
00:00:02,487 --> 00:00:06,800
similar to the one for occurrences of Alice. But instead of using specific

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,830
references to the word Alice, like Alice, and the length of Alice. It'll use

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:17,260
the given word, and the length of the given word. The calculation of the length

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,500
won't change. But the calculation of the length without the word will. Looks

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:27,754
like I need to actually take in a parameter. And now I return the length, minus

7
00:00:27,754 --> 00:00:34,498
the length without the word. Over the length of the word. Let's add something

8
00:00:34,498 --> 00:00:39,458
to our booktester, to test our new method. To check it we could compare it to

9
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:43,244
our answer for Alice. Looks like I didn't actually make a method occurrences

10
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:51,760
of. Ops. Occurrences of Alice. Should be more general. Hopefully now it'll

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,177
compile better. Here we know to expect 395 from before, and there's another

12
00:00:57,177 --> 00:01:03,662
word that we checked how many times it occurs. We saw before that Mad Hatter

13
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:09,523
doesn't occur at all. Let's try this out. Looks like we got the answers we

14
00:01:09,523 --> 00:01:10,940
expected.
