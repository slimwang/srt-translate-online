00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,690
After the participant sections come the collaborations sections.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,360
Collaboration is

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,640
how the participants work together to accomplish the pattern's goals.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,770
The composite pattern is an example of a structural pattern.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,600
One in which the organization of the information provides the primarily,

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,270
the primary value added.

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,300
For structural patterns, collaboration plays a less important role than

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,558
structure in providing information to the designer.

9
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:27,970
Nevertheless, understanding inter-element behavior is important.

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,700
For example, with the composite pattern,

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,610
a typical behavior is to have the composites iterate through their children,

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,590
performing some operation on each.
