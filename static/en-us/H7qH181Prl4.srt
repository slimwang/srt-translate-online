1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,250
So far, we've addressed the first
of the remaining questions we had

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,520
about the Fordâ€“Fulkerson algorithm.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,200
Now we turn to the second question
regarding its running time.

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,950
Recall that the only
bound that we have so

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,830
far on the number of iterations,
is the value of the flow itself,

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,480
since each iteration must increase the
value of the flow that we find by one.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,510
Let's see if this bound is tight.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,620
Consider the flow network below, and

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,710
give the maximum number of augmenting
paths that Ford-Fulkerson might find.
