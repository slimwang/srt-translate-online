00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,090
Okay, here's a quiz! So, just to get at this issue of why it's

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,230
so important that we consider infinite hypothesis

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,610
spaces, let's look at some hypothesis spaces that

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,330
have come up in prior lectures. So, for each one on this list check

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,190
it off if it's infinite, and otherwise don't check it off. Does that make sense?

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,990
>> Makes sense to me.

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,410
>> Alright, let's do it.

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,190
>> Go.
