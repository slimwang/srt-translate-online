1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It turns out the answer is no, not all problems have efficient algorithms.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
They are some that actually require an exponential amount of running time.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
For example, an algorithm may have a bound of Î¸(2âż).

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So an n gets larger, this is getting larger and larger and larger very very quickly.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So this is considered not efficient.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We're going to talk in this course about any other problems that have provable lower bounds

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that are exponential that is to say that there can be no polynomial time solution to them.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
There is one in the literature, which is a generalization of checkers

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that you can learn more about if you take a course in complexity.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But what I would like to talk about is this sort of funny gap between the problems that we know

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
have efficient solutions that have polynomial running time,

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and the problems that we know do not have efficient solutions.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
They have the fastest algorithms that could run for them have to take of this exponential time.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Then in between here there's a gap.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There's actually some very very important problems that we don't know

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
whether they have a polynomial time solution of if they require exponential time.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
They are just kind off hovering in this no man's land. The great unknown.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There's lot of different kinds of classes of problems that live in this gap,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
but I'm going to focus on for this unit is a class of problems known as the NP complete problems.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
They are not the only problems that fall in here, but they are very important class

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and probably the best studied class of problems that actually fall in this gap

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
where we just don't know if they are polynomial or exponential running time,

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and it's really frustrating that we don't know where this problems lie, but we do know something,

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and that is for all the NP complete problems

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
either they are all easy and they fit in the polynomial running time class or they are all hard

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and they fit in the exponential time running class.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We don't know which it is, but we do know that they can all be hang together,

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and so sometimes it's very useful if your studying a problem to discover whether it belongs

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
to this funny class of NP complete problems

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
that fit in the gap, so that's what we're going to take a look at.
