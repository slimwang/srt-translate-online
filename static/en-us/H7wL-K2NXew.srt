00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Here is my solution. Test is a function of the data l and the hypothesis h.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We first compute the mean and then the plus/minus term of the confidence intervals,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and if our actual hypothesis differs from the mean by less than the confidence interval size,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
we return true, and that is a two-sided test,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
hence the absolute involving the difference between h and m.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If we look at this, this logical expression at the bottom will only trigger,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
if h deviates way too much more than c from m, and so it goes.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Down here is the output of our example from class. 201.5 was the mean.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
1.366 was the size of the interval, and we got a false.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We don't believe h zero.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If I change my hypothesis to 201 and one will test again, we now get a true as a result of this test.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Great. You programmed confidence intervals and you programmed a hypothesis test.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That is actually really cool. If you programmed it, I bet you now really know how it works.
