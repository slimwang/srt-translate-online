00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
This is Adrienne Felt.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,000
Adrienne is a PhD student at Berkeley, and she's done a lot of interesting work

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
on computer security.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So what do our students need to understand about security?

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
One of the first projects I looked at, which I actually worked here with Dr. Evans,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
was I use Facebook and I install and use Facebook applications.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Many of you may be familiar with the Washington Post Social Reader.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And at the time I was just curious.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,500
What are these doing with my data? How are they getting my data?

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,000
How do these things work?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And so I decided to learn more about how they work,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and from there it led to basically what ended up becoming my thesis topic in a PhD program.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm still interested in how do applications get data and how do they use the data.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
When developers are writing applications that access users' private information

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
or resources like their location or their camera,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
they need to keep in mind that they need to a) respect users' privacy

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and only use the resources that they need to use,

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and b) they have to be careful to build their applications in such a way

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
that they don't accidentally leak this data to other applications.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So I primarily focus on Android development and security of Android applications.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
One thing that's really important for an Android application developer to know

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
is about the privacy and security of their applications.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So when a user installs an application from the Android Market,

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
they're shown things called permissions, which are small warnings

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
that tell the user about all of the resources that the application gets access to on their phone.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
For example, for this application I'm looking at,

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the application can get access to location, the Internet, the list of contacts, camera, etc.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So the user is warned before the application installation is completed

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
that the application can do all of these things.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So as a developer, it's important to only ask for access

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
to resources that your application really needs.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Otherwise you might unnecessarily scare off users

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
who might otherwise want to install your application.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So one of the projects we built was a static analysis tool

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
that analyzes the permission usage of Android applications

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
so that it can warn developers if developers are requesting more permissions

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
than they actually need for their applications to work.
