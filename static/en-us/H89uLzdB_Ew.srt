00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,410
I'll be going over these
answers pretty quickly, but

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:06,280
we're going to go into more detail
about if else statements after that.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,790
For this code snippet in
the weatherActivity.java file,

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,310
we create a boolean that's called
isRaining and we initialize it to false.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,690
Then we go to the next line of code,
which prints out a log statement

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,460
that says, thank you for
using the weather weather app.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,970
Then we have an if else statement.

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,600
If the isRaining boolean is true,

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,830
then we should run the code in between
these opening and closing braces.

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,920
Otherwise if the isRaining
boolean is false,

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,720
then we should do the code inside
these opening and closing braces.

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,597
Since isRaining is actually false,
as shown up here,

13
00:00:40,597 --> 00:00:45,585
then we skip this if condition and
go all the way down to this else case.

14
00:00:45,585 --> 00:00:47,131
Within this else block of code,

15
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:50,009
we have one log message that
prints It's unlikely to rain.

16
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:52,747
Reading through all of this code,
it should say, Thank you for

17
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:54,151
using the whetherweather App.

18
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:58,800
And then it should skip down to here and
say, It's unlikely to rain.

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,240
That leads us to answer C.

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,710
Continue on for more practice.
