1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,980
Now we are ready to create deployments,
one for each service.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,610
Front in, auth, and hello.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,660
Then will defy internal services for
the off and hello deployments.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,900
And an external service for
the front in deployment.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,149
Let's examine the off
deployment configuration file.

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,250
The first thing I'm going to do is
specify the number of replicas.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,200
This deployment can be used to scale
pods by changing the replica count

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,650
in our manifest.

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,950
Moving on, you can see the labels that
will be attached to the off pods.

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:35,090
A little further down you'll see we're
using Version 1.0 of the off container.

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,820
Use the kubectl create command
to create the off deployment.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,800
As with any other kubernetes object,
we can use to describe command

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,900
to see more information
about the off deployment.

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,970
Okay, it's now time to create
a service for off deployment.

15
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,958
You've already seen service manifest
files, so I won't go into details here.

16
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:57,299
Use the kubectl create command
to create the off service.

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,790
Now, I'm going to do the same thing to
create and expose the hello deployment.

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,895
I wanted to repeat these steps one more
time for the front end deployment.

19
00:01:07,895 --> 00:01:10,790
We'll also need to configure engine X
like we did in the previous tutorial.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,290
Now we are ready to interact with
the front in by grabbing this external

21
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,290
IP address.

22
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,520
And using curl to hit it.

23
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,070
Congratulations, you've deployed
the multi-service application using

24
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,160
kubernetes.

25
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,410
The skills you've learned here will
allow you to deploy complex applications

26
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,200
on kubernetes using a collection
of deployments and services.
