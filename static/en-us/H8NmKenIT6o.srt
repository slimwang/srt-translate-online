1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,130
And the answer is the first three.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:06,525
This last one doesn't make any sense,
because Yuv must be non-negative.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,270
If u were in B, and Y were in A,
then Yuv would be 0,

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,290
which shouldn't count towards
our objective function.

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,880
One thing to notice immediately
about this program is that

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,450
because the capacities are all positive,
the Yuvs will be as small as possible.

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:28,116
Next, the parallelism between
these equations suggest

8
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:33,309
that we think of, ys,
being a variable fixed as 1,

9
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:37,452
and yt, be a variable here, fixed as 0.

10
00:00:37,452 --> 00:00:42,197
All of these edge variables then
only need be greater than zero when

11
00:00:42,197 --> 00:00:47,820
the left hand variable over here is
one and the right hand one is zero.

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,460
This immediately suggests that variables
with a single sub script indicate

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,150
which side of the partition in the s-t
cut the corresponding vertex is on.

14
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,160
If they differ in the right direction.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,030
Then Yuv must be one,
it's an edge cut by the cut and

16
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,610
the capacity of that edge counts
towards the objective function.

17
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,920
The first three points follow
from this realization.
