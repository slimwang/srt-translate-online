00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And I would argue that this is possible.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It sounds arrogant to say that most people are smarter than the average person.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sure it's not based on scientific evidence but statistically this is very much possible.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
When people say this is a contradiction--it can't be that most people are smarter than average.

00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Just smile and say--you took Sebastian's stats 101 and you understand.
