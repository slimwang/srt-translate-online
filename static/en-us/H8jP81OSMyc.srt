1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,780
All right.
So, the first filter that we want to

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,010
apply is: the conference
is taking place in Tokyo,

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,910
which is to say, conference.city,
double equals, string Tokyo.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,110
Then, if we want one to
nine seats available,

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,980
that means we want greater than zero and
less than ten.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,160
You could also use greater than or equal
to one, or less than or equal to nine,

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,470
if you want, but
this is pretty straightforward.

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,460
Then we have three order by conditions.

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,790
First we want to order by seats
available, then by name, and

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,980
finally by month.

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,000
And there we go, all on one line, or
seven, depending on how you count.
