00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,568
Let's see what this graph predicicts the population will be in 2013. I'll slide

2
00:00:05,568 --> 00:00:11,737
my point down to the corerect X value. In 2013, it says there should be 3.2

3
00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:18,880
billion people. So is this an accurate prediction? The answer is no. We saw on

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,613
our chart earlier that by 2011 there were 7 billion people in the world. So,

5
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:28,951
this is greatly underestimating the total world population. Using only the

6
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:32,427
first two points in our chart doesn't actually predict very well what the

7
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:34,880
population ended up being.
