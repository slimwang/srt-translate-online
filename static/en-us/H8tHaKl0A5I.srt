1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,030
Well, it was a little bit of
a trick question because both

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:11,215
of these will accomplish the same goal,
namely normalizing everything

3
00:00:11,215 --> 00:00:16,600
according to the first row.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,280
This method uses two nested four
loops to go through each date for

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,380
each symbol and then make the division.

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,330
This is the preferred method however,
and

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,120
that's because it's elegant,
just a single line.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,990
We divide the entire data
frame by its first row.

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,630
The other reason that this is the way to
do it is because it's much much faster.

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,510
This ends up being executed
in C at lower levels.

11
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,020
Whereas this will be executed
at the higher level,

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,900
the higher interpreter
levels of Pandas and Python
