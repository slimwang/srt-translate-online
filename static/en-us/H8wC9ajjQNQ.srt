00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,410
Well you did it again.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,170
You made it to the end of a course.

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,100
We hope that you have a new confidence
in your tool set for persisting data.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,570
It seems pretty likely that you feel
good about NSUserDefaults and NSCoding.

00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,920
We hope that you have a new
affection for Core Data as well.

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,420
See you soon.
