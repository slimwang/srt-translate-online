00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,560
Oftentimes in research, we're interested
in making a change in the world and

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,030
then measuring the effect
that that change had.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:06,530
For example,

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,920
we might want to give students a tool
that we believe will help them learn,

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,050
and then measure how well that
tool actually helped them learn.

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,170
But sometimes we're not ready to
actually make a change in the world yet.

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,820
Sometimes we just want to understand
the world a little bit better.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,150
We just want to understand
the nature of reality, and

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,980
that can then inform some
tools we design later on.

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,610
Survey research is one
way of doing this.

11
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,090
In survey research we're not actually
making a change to our participants.

12
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,159
We're just asking them to report on
their opinions, their perspectives,

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,600
their experiences.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,520
And using the results of those surveys,

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,420
we then construct an understanding of
whatever population we're investigating.

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,960
Survey research can be
very complicated though.

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,000
It's very difficult to
design a good survey.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,136
It's difficult to know how to draw
a representative sample out of

19
00:00:46,136 --> 00:00:47,340
a population of people.

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,340
You might not even know
what those words mean yet.

21
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,030
So in this lesson we're going
to talk about these things.

22
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,550
We'll talk about designing good surveys,
and making sure that the results you get

23
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,840
from those surveys are actually valid
and generalizable to that population.
