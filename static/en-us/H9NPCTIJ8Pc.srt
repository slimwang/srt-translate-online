1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,280
So, here I have two curves, okay, f1 and

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,670
f2, and those are meant to be
as taken in two different times.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,410
And, here I'm just looking at
this point, x0, and, just so

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,290
you understand, this is the value at,
if you will, time two.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,940
This is the value at time one,
and that's true for all of these.

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,090
And the question is,
how much does the curve move?

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:28,400
So, what I have to do is,
I want to find this displacement at x0.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,150
All right, so do it as follows.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,410
So, here's how we do it.

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,010
We initialize, since this is iterative,
we have to initialize.

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,060
We'll first start by assuming
that our displacement was 0.

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,760
That is u and v are all 0's everywhere.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,260
That's great,
that makes the work really, really fast.

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,520
I don't do anything,
it's the original picture.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,510
Now I have to estimate the next one,

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,160
d1 by figuring out what
the new displacement is.

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,990
That's what this new little
delta d is going to be.

18
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,200
So how do I do that?

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,950
Well I have to compute
these tangents and

20
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,850
you can see the tangents
are right there, okay?

21
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,170
And what I do is,
based upon that tangent, come down here.

22
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,550
It says oh, okay,
if this thing were actually a plane,

23
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,500
this amount, that's my d hat.

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:17,110
That's the amount I have to displace
over in order to line up these points.

25
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,667
That's assuming this thing were a plane.

26
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:22,350
If we really were a plane, that would be
the amount that I would have to move.

27
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,750
So let me do that displacement and
I end up there.

28
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,730
So now I've got my d1 which was
just d0 plus my new estimate.

29
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,583
And guess what?

30
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:36,125
I have to do it again so now I take a
look and say I have to move this amount.

31
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:40,160
So I add that to my d,
and I move it that much.

32
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,110
And guess what?

33
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:41,840
I do it again.

34
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,930
Estimate tiny little d hat, this time.

35
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,830
And voila.

36
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:53,670
It turns out that f1 of x minus d3
is almost exactly f2 at this point.

37
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,220
Okay?

38
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,500
That's the iterative refinement.

39
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,060
And the only thing that
it takes in order to do

40
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,850
this iterative Lukas-Kanade beyond
the regular one is this warping step.

41
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,810
Given some UV that you've
computed between one image and

42
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,810
the next, take that first image,
warp it through that, that flow field.

43
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,890
And now you'll have almost the second
image, and you just apply it over again
