00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,689
For this first one, translations represent movements. Just like vectors can be

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:08,071
summed together to make a single movement vector, translations can be multiplied

3
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:11,668
together to get a single translation. The order that we add the vectors doesn't

4
00:00:11,668 --> 00:00:15,250
matter. Likewise, translation order among translations doesn't matter. So the

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,660
answer is yes. Rotation order certainly does matter. Reversing the order will

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,529
normally change the effect. So this second question's answer is no. For scaling,

7
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:27,980
each access scale is independent of the others. If you stretch an object along

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,955
the y-axis, its x and z coordinates do not change. Because each is independent,

9
00:00:31,955 --> 00:00:35,376
there is no danger of the scales interacting with each other. Each axes' scale

10
00:00:35,376 --> 00:00:39,831
factors can simply be multiplied together. Multiplication is commutative, so the

11
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:44,280
scales can be done in any order. Yes. For this last question, say you rotate

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,484
around the y-axis and translate along the same axis. The rotations can be done

13
00:00:48,484 --> 00:00:52,731
in any order, since each is just an angle change around the y-axis. The rotation

14
00:00:52,731 --> 00:00:56,726
affects the x and z coordinates of any point transformed. Translation affects

15
00:00:56,726 --> 00:01:00,298
only the y coordinates. Since these are independent values, rotations and

16
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:04,422
translations along the axis can be evaluated in any order. So the answer here is

17
00:01:04,422 --> 00:01:04,733
yes.
