00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:06,425
We need an exponent of 4 here and an exponent of 6 here. Remember that the

2
00:00:06,425 --> 00:00:10,956
interest is being compounded twice a year. So to figure out how many times it

3
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:16,500
has been compounded total, we multiply the number of years that have passed

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,491
times the number of times compounded in a year.
