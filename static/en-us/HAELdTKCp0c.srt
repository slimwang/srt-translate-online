00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,740
Now that we have written our word in Pos
function, let's put it all together.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,070
In this quiz, you'll write code for
a final function, play_game,

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,080
which will be our new and
improved madlibs generator, which can

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,710
replace words other than noun and verb,
and keep all existing punctuation.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,490
The function takes in as inputs,

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,860
parts of speech, which is a list
of acceptable replacement words.

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,888
And ml_string,

8
00:00:22,888 --> 00:00:27,304
a string which can contain replacement
words found in parts_of_speech.

9
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:31,420
Your play_game function will return the
joined list replaced, which will have

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,250
the same structure as ml_string, only
that the replacement words are swapped

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,310
out with corgi, since this program can
not replace those words with user input.

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,593
After we write code for this function,
we'll show you how to integrate user

13
00:00:43,593 --> 00:00:47,029
input, which will be a very simple task,
and walk you through the steps on how to

14
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:49,158
run this program on your Mac or
Windows machine.

15
00:00:49,158 --> 00:00:53,131
We already went over how we'll approach
writing code for this function a couple

16
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:56,628
videos back, but the basic idea is
to convert ml_string into a list,

17
00:00:56,628 --> 00:01:00,421
iterate over it, check if the current
iteration is in parts_of_speech,

18
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:02,584
using the word and
post function we wrote.

19
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:05,251
And if it is,
we replace the word with corgi, but

20
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:09,150
make sure to keep the punctuation and
add it to replaced.

21
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,340
If the iteration or word we're looking
at is not in the list parts of speech,

22
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,560
we'll just add it to replaced.

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,050
We continue this process until we
reach the end of the split ml_string,

24
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,570
convert the list replaced into a string
by using the join function and

25
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,220
return the new replaced string.

26
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,640
All right, good luck.
