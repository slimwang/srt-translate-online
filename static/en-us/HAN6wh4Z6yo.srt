So, the last stage of life is of course death. Now, it's sobering to think

2
00:00:03,864 --> 00:00:06,600
about, but we're all going to to die and we all know we're going to die.

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,190
Different people respond to death in different ways. These differences are best

00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,240
seen in cases where people know that they're going to die in advance and have

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,057
time to prepare for it. For example, someone with a terminal illness. The

00:00:20,057 --> 00:00:24,128
psychologist Elisabeth Kç«¯bler-Ross developed the most widely known and applied

00:00:24,128 --> 00:00:29,120
psychological model of people's response to death. People go through

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,207
predictable stages with their own death. Most people go through all of these

9
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:37,782
stages, but some stages may be more intense than others. The five stages are

10
00:00:37,782 --> 00:00:42,200
denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.
