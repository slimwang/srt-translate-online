00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,800
Let's look at the answer to
our fault classification quiz.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,860
The phone got wet.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,930
By cause,
it's definitely an environmental fault.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,440
What kind of fault by duration is it?

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,670
Getting wet is a transient fault.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,490
Eventually it gets dry.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,460
The explosion would have been
a permanent fault from which you

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,570
really cannot recover, but
getting wet is only a transient fault.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,000
Now because the phone was supposed to
prevent itself from running when wet,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,600
the fact that it did heat up, and

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,650
it wasn't suppose to,
is an indication of a design fault.

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,590
So really,
it was suppose to not do this but

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,030
the way it was designed actually made
it do that, so it's a design fault.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,670
And design faults
are typically permanent.

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,890
And this is one more example
of when you can have a fault

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,490
that never becomes an error or failure.

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,560
So the permanent fault of
being poorly designed so

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,750
that when it gets wet it can heat up and
explode would never become an error or

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,260
a failure until we actually
get that particular phone wet.
