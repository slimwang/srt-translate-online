00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,910
Overcoming rejections from investors
is something all entrepreneurs do.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,460
Google, LinkedIn, all those
founders got rejected dozens and

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,200
dozens of times before they
got their first investment.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,270
So if you get rejected, good news!

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,010
You're part of a great
group of entrepreneurs, and

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,070
it's actually part of the process.

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,840
I think the key is to
learn from each rejection.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,100
Why were you rejected?

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,970
Maybe you didn't approach the right
investors in the first place.

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,430
Maybe your pitch was too long or
not clear enough.

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,290
Try to get that feedback from
the investor as to how to improve it and

12
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,730
improve your chances of raising
funding with other investors.
