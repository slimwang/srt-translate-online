2
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:06,410
Ajay, what's wrong?

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,699
>> Well, I'm really having
a hard time finding a new home.

4
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:14,099
You see,
I like to be in a very specific area.

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,410
And it would be awesome if I could
tell the site which blocks I want.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,440
And which blocks I do not want.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,660
But I'm left having to go
through them one by one.

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,620
>> Ooh, that sounds really frustrating,
why don't try using my listing site?

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,789
You see, in my site, you can draw the
exact area that you want to live within,

10
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:34,750
and only search for
listings within that area.

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,899
You can leave out the shady
parts of the neighborhood.

12
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:37,640
>> Really?

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,408
Wow, thanks,
I'll be sure to check it out.

14

15
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:45,487
>> Let's dive back into
the JavaScript API and

16
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:48,870
learn how to put such a dope
feature into our site.

17
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:53,396
Remember that library's parameter we
added earlier into our call to load

18
00:00:53,396 --> 00:00:53,987
the API?

19
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:57,469
We're going to load the geometry
library when we load the API by using

20
00:00:57,469 --> 00:00:59,670
the library's parameter.

21
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,196
Yep, that.

22
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,146
So a lot like a physical library,

23
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:07,349
the maps JavaScript API libraries
are full of useful things.

24
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:09,059
But they're only useful
when you use them.

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,600
And they take up extra
space if you don't.

26
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:12,609
Like all of your cookbooks.

27
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:15,560
It would be a lot better not to have
them sitting around if you're just going

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,060
to get takeout.

29
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,879
With the maps API libraries,
you only load what you need.

30
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,010
So we already have the geometry library
loaded, which allowed us to use that

31
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,130
cool spherical calculation to get
the heading for our street view image.

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,579
The geometry library is all about making
it easier to do complicated calculations

33
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:34,340
in the mapping space.

34
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:38,989
Essentially it allows you to skip
the math and let Google do the work for

35
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:42,869
you when trying to translate our 3D
world into the 2D mapping space.

36
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:46,209
There's also the visualization library.

37
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:49,445
Which it allows you to use your
data set to create heat maps or

38
00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:52,123
other representations
of data concentration.

39
00:01:52,123 --> 00:01:55,050
Read through the next section to
learn more about those two libraries.
