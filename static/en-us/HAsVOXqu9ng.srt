1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,600
So now that you've learned about pacing
your game and making it challenging.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,710
But not too challenging by
adding goals and obstacles.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,870
What else can we do to keep
our players interested?

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,570
>> I know I'm getting a lot better
playing our bouncing game by myself but

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,500
I wish there was some way I could
know exactly how good I am.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,570
>> Yeah.
It would be great to see how we rank

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,080
against other players.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,840
Let's play against each other and
add some competition.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,020
>> All right, when players compete and
have a chance to win or set a record,

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,910
they have even more motivation to
keep coming back to your game.

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,770
Let's see some different ways that
game apps create competition.

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,240
>> One simple way to create some
friendly competition in your app

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,260
is to add a leader board which lists
the players with the highest scores or

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,380
achievements.

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,940
Like in the game Temple Run,

16
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,040
it lets players share their rank with
one another and lets you keep track

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,270
of the highest scores over the current
day, the week, and over all time.

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,060
Another good way to include
competition is with personal ratings

19
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,350
like the star rating in Angry Birds,

20
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,640
which is an example of
a personal player achievement.

21
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,680
It gives players a number of stars,

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,110
one out of three,
based on how well they beat the level.

23
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,120
This gives them an idea of how
skilled they are at the game.

24
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,460
And if they think they can do better,
they'll play the game for a longer time.

25
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,310
And the more time players
spend in your game,

26
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,990
the more money it will
eventually be able to make.

27
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,950
Another way to get players to
keep coming back to your game

28
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,740
is to offer them special timed awards.

29
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,240
Really cool items or mystery stages
during a specific time window.

30
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,810
This is also a great strategy for

31
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,610
getting players who may have
left your game to come back.

32
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,910
By offering a special stage or award you
keep your game exciting and interesting.

33
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,730
For example, puzzle and
dragons have urgent dungeons that can

34
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,710
only be played on a specific day or
within a limited timeframe,

35
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,080
like this dungeon can only
be played on a Thursday.

36
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,240
Other games have daily or
weekly challenges.

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,610
And these special timed events, combined
with leaderboards and achievements,

38
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,850
create exciting competition between
members of the gaming community.

39
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,120
And are all great ways to
keep players involved.
