00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Norvig] Here we see a more complete representation of a problem solving domain

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
in the language of classical planning.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Here's the Fly action schema.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I've made it a little bit more explicit with from and to airports

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
rather than X or Y.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We want to deal with transporting cargo.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So in addition to flying, we have an operator to load cargo, C, onto a plane, P, at airport A--

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
you can see the preconditions and effects there--

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and an action to unload the cargo from the plane

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
with preconditions and effects.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We have a representation of the initial state.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There's 2 pieces of cargo, there's 2 planes and 2 airports.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This representation is rich enough and the algorithms on it are good enough

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that we could have hundreds or thousands of cargo planes and so on

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
representing millions of ground actions.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If we had 10 airports and 100 planes, that would be 100, 1,000, 10,000 different Fly actions.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And if we had thousands of pieces of cargo,

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
there would be even more Load and Unload actions,

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
but they can all be represented by the succinct schema.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So the initial state tells us what's what, where everything is,

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and then we can represent the goal state:

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
that we want to have this piece of cargo has to be delivered to this airport,

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and another piece of cargo has to be delivered to this airport.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So now we know what actions and problems of initial and goal state looks like

25
00:01:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in this representation, but how do we do planning using this?
