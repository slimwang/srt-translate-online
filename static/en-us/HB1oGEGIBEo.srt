00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,150
So it seems that the variable audioPlayer is defined within, and

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,730
is local to this function viewDidLoad.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,100
And I'm trying to use it here, in the playSlowAudio function.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,330
To fix this, I can declare it as a global variable at the top here.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,780
And I can remove the initialization from within viewDidLoad.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,750
So the variable AudioPlayer is of type AVAudioPlayer.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,420
It's being declared here, initialized here, and used here.

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,600
All right, let's run this project.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,890
I'll go to the second scene and then click on this button.

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,590
>> My mama always said, life was like a box of chocolates.

11
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,650
>> All right, we have sound.
