00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,452
Let's learn one last method to help us solve what may look like a quadratic

2
00:00:03,452 --> 00:00:09,185
equation. Let's look at the equation x to the fourth minus 13x squared plus 36

3
00:00:09,185 --> 00:00:14,196
equals 0. This equation is considered to be a pseudo-quadratic equation, or a

4
00:00:14,196 --> 00:00:18,518
false one. It almost appears to be quadratic, but we really have a fourth power

5
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:23,740
here. Notice too that we have no odd powers of x. We just have x to the fourth,

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,666
x squared and then no x term, just a constant here. We can change this equation

7
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:33,995
into a quadratic equation that we can potentially solve. This part would be

8
00:00:33,995 --> 00:00:38,415
quadratic, since we would have something squared minus another something plus a

9
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:43,605
constant. Notice how the powers on any variable term would be 2 then 1 and then

10
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:48,795
0, since there's no variable here. In this first equation, we actually have a

11
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:53,122
repeated expression here. When we have an expression that's repeated, we can

12
00:00:53,122 --> 00:00:56,594
make a substitution for that expression and replace it so we have a simpler

13
00:00:56,594 --> 00:01:02,258
equation to solve. So what do you think is that repeated expression? What

14
00:01:02,258 --> 00:01:04,260
should we place inside these parentheses?
