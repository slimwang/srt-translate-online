1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,500
We can remove a 4 from the first 3 terms of out numerator, leaving us with 4

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,124
times x squared plus 4x plus 4. We can also remove a 4 as a greatest common

3
00:00:10,124 --> 00:00:14,010
factor from 4x and 8. This leaves us with 4 times x plus 2 in our denominator.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,707
We have a quadratic trinomial here and not only that it's a perfect square

5
00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:23,212
trinomial, so we can factor that as x plus 2 times x plus 2. Finally, we cancel

6
00:00:23,212 --> 00:00:27,570
the factors in the numerator and the denominator. So x plus two divided by x

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,772
plus two equals one, and four divided by four equals one. Remember, we're only

8
00:00:31,772 --> 00:00:35,930
simplifying factors, or things that are being multiplied in our numerator and

9
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,832
our denominator. This leaves us with x plus two divided by one, or just x plus

10
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:45,450
two. Notice that not every rational expression simplifies to another fraction.

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,883
Sometimes we'll just get another polynomial.
