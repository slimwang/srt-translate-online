1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,766
Let's return to our diagram of the HTTP
request and response lifecycle and

2
00:00:04,766 --> 00:00:07,515
talk about step one,
forming the request.

3
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:11,915
We mentioned earlier that a client
can request data from a web server by

4
00:00:11,915 --> 00:00:13,339
accessing it via URL.

5
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:16,279
In conversation,
you may hear this URL be

6
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:20,731
referred to as a query URL where
query means a request for data.

7
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:25,188
In our case, we can get the earthquake
information from the USGS by going to

8
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:26,478
a very specific URL.

9
00:00:26,478 --> 00:00:30,554
Note that the different USGS URL's
will give us different data.

10
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:34,491
These are known as different server API
endpoints that the client can talk to.

11
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:39,254
For this example, this URL gives us
the top earthquakes in the world from

12
00:00:39,254 --> 00:00:43,017
January 1st, 2016 to January 31st, 2016.

13
00:00:43,017 --> 00:00:47,632
Now this is a completely different URL
that gives us the top earthquakes over

14
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:51,108
the same time period but
with a magnitude of 5 or higher.

15
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:54,771
Later in lesson four, we will explore
the different parts of a URL and

16
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:57,439
how you can modify it to
get the data that you want.

17
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,246
All right, here's another
example if you're curious.

18
00:01:00,246 --> 00:01:03,278
Now Spotify is a popular music
streaming service today.

19
00:01:03,278 --> 00:01:06,509
And they provide the developer API
that you can use to create an app or

20
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:08,844
website that communicates
with their service.

21
00:01:08,844 --> 00:01:10,132
Assuming a base URL,

22
00:01:10,132 --> 00:01:14,799
you can add additional parts to that
URL to hit different Spotify endpoints.

23
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,626
For example, you can get albums, you can
get specific tracks within an album.

24
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:24,936
And you can get an artist's top tracks
simply by just changing the pieces that

25
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:26,272
you add to the base URL.

26
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,124
In other words, by adding this
additional text to the URL,

27
00:01:29,124 --> 00:01:32,048
you're actually hitting different
end points on that API.

28
00:01:32,048 --> 00:01:34,614
Okay, so back to our tsunami app.

29
00:01:34,614 --> 00:01:35,929
We query specific URL and

30
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,821
our app shows the first earthquake that
comes back in the list of results.

31
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:40,532
For this quiz,

32
00:01:40,532 --> 00:01:44,000
I want you to look through the app
code to find where it's located.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,680
What's the name of the variable
that holds the query URL?

34
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,343
Then I want you to modify the value
of that variable to be a different

35
00:01:52,343 --> 00:01:53,110
USGS URL.

36
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,893
Use the link in the notes below.

37
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:58,320
Now once you change that URL,
build and run the app on your device.

38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,450
You should see a different
earthquake displayed on the screen.

39
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,120
So write down the location of that
earthquake that you see in the app here.
