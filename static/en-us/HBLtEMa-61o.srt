1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,019
So let us take a look at what is a cognitive system.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,060
Notice that I'm using the term cognitive system and

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,970
not the term knowledge-based AI agent. I could have used that term also.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,130
When we talk about knowledge-based AI agent, then we could take two views.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,770
One view is that we are going to build a knowledge-based AI system, which need

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,880
not be human like. Another view is that the knowledge based AI agent that

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,282
we will build will be human-like. The cognitive system is situated in the world.

8
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:34,310
Here by the world I mean the physical world. For example, the world that I

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,330
am interacting with right now, with this screen in front of me and

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,350
this microphone. This world is perceptionate. There's an example, the percept

11
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,770
something being a straight line or a color of some object. Or the smoothness of

12
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,670
some of the texture of some object. This perceptionate around the world and

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,760
cognitive system is using sensors to perceive this percept. That's the input of

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,540
the cognitive system. The cognitive system also has some actuators. So, for

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,750
example, I have fingers that I'm using right now to point to things. And

16
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:13,230
a cognitive system uses actuators to carry out actions on the world.

17
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:19,030
Cognitive system then is taking perceptor's input and giving actions as output.

18
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:24,000
So far, we've talked about a single cognitive system. But of course one can have

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,120
multiple cognitive systems. These multiple cognitive systems can interact with

20
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,920
each other. Just like a cognitive system situated in a physical world,

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,560
it is also situated in a social world. Let us now zoom into the inside

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,960
of a cognitive system. What is the architecture of a cognitive system?

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,260
So the cognitive system takes as input certain percepts about the world. It has

24
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,140
a task of giving as output actions of the world. The question then becomes, how

25
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,350
can these percepts be mapped into actions? One way of mapping them is that we

26
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,780
will do a direct mapping. These percepts will be directly mapped into actions.

27
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,940
Let's take an example. Imagine that you're driving a car, and the brake lights

28
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:13,420
of the car in front of you, become bright red. Should that happen, you will then

29
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,290
press on the brakes of your car. Well, that is an example of a reactive system.

30
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,095
The percepts were that the break lights on the car in front of you became bright

31
00:02:22,095 --> 00:02:26,460
red and the action was that you pressed on your own brakes. In doing so,

32
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,750
you may not have planned. This is now a direct mapping of percept into actions.

33
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,540
Alternatively, consider a slightly different problem.

34
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,210
Again you're driving you're car on the highway, but

35
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:42,360
as you're trying to drive on the highway your task this time is to change lanes.

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,860
Now, in order to change lanes, again you may look around and

37
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,970
look at the percept of the road. There are other cars on the road, for

38
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,179
example, and you need to take some action that will help you change lanes.

39
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,910
This time you may actually deliberate, you may actually look at

40
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,510
the goal that you have as well as the percepts of the environment and

41
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,710
come up with a plan that will tell you what action to take. As we discussed in

42
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:11,050
the last lesson, the deliberation itself has a number of components in it.

43
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,400
Three of the major components that we'll studying in this class are learning,

44
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,610
reasoning, and memory. These three components interact with each other in

45
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,040
many interesting ways that we will decipher as we go along.

46
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,820
Now, deliberation was reasoning about the world around us. So

47
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,780
if I take that example again of changing lanes, as I'm driving on the highway,

48
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,190
then I'm reasoning about the world around me. Where are the other cars? Should I

49
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:41,390
change lanes to the left or to the right. Metacognition on the other hand,

50
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:46,490
the third layer here, has to do with reasoning about the internal mental world.

51
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,470
So metacognition reasons about the deliberation. Or metacognition can

52
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,310
also reason about reaction. Let us take an example of the metacognition also.

53
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,130
Image again that I had to change lanes. And I did,

54
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:05,240
as I changed lanes to the left, the cars behind me honk because I

55
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,760
did not leave enough space for the car that was already moving on the left lane.

56
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,380
In that case I know that the lane changing did not go very smoothly.

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,399
I may now think about my own actions in the world, about the deliberation that

58
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:27,030
led to those actions, and I may then decide to change or reconfigure, or

59
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,200
repair the deliberation that led to that sub-optimal plan for

60
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,380
changing the lanes. That is an example of metacognition. So now I

61
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,490
have this three layered architecture, reaction, deliberation, metacognition.

62
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,620
Note that we have defined intelligence in a way, intelligence here is

63
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,270
about mapping percepts in the world, interactions in the world. Intelligence is

64
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,480
about selecting the right kind of action given a particular state of the world.

65
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,256
But there are many different ways in which we can map the percepts into actions.

66
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:02,810
Purely reactive, deliberative, or

67
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:08,390
also entailing metacognition on the deliberation and the reaction. This then is

68
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,490
the overall architecture of the cognitive system. This is called a three layered

69
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,960
architecture. We'll be returning to this architecture many times in this course.
