1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,552
Over here where we'll still know we're
in one of four states rather than in one

2
00:00:04,551 --> 00:00:05,580
of eight states.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,824
Note that it's possible to form
a plan that reaches a goal without

4
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:10,469
ever observing the world.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,050
Plans like that are called
conformant plans.

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,280
For example,

7
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,939
if the goal is to be in a clean
location, all we have to do is suck.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,460
So we go from one of these eight
states to one of these four states

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,260
In every one of those four,
we're in a clean location.

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,289
We don't know which of the four we're
in, but we know we've achieved the goal.

11
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:35,679
It's also possible to arrive
at a completely known state.

12
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,953
For example,
if we start here, we go left,

13
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:43,471
we suck up the dirt there,
we go right, and suck up the dirt.

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,429
Now, we're down to a belief state
consisting of one single state.

15
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:49,039
That is we know exactly where we are.

16
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,057
Here's a question for you.

17
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:56,094
How do I get from the state where I
know my current square is clean but

18
00:00:56,094 --> 00:01:00,347
know nothing else to the belief state
where I know that I'm in the right

19
00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:04,060
hand side location and
that that location is clean?

20
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,001
What I want you to do is click on
the sequence of actions, left, right, or

21
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,880
suck, that will take us from
that start to that goal.

22
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:20,879
