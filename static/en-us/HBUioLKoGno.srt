1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,970
Let's make our GitHub account.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:08,570
>> Okay. So I'm going to call it 2048-class. Okay, and

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,570
then I'll do the free play, and I"m sure that's fine. Right?

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,786
>> Yeah.

5
00:00:11,786 --> 00:00:13,997
>> That doesn't seem to do anything, but

6
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:16,760
I don't want to enter my credit card number

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,994
>> Hm.

8
00:00:17,994 --> 00:00:19,724
>> Maybe I can, okay set up my account.

9
00:00:19,724 --> 00:00:22,985
>> Let's see. Yeah, let's just see if we can go

10
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:25,699
to the account. It looks like it's set up. I don't know.

11
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:27,696
I guess we don't need to put in a credit card.

12
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:32,003
>> Alright, so we have an account. What's, what do we do next?

13
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:34,829
>> Well so we, first we need to install Git.

14
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,681
And so there, there are two ways to access Git.

15
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:38,819
>> What is, what is Git?

16
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:39,942
>> It's the version control system itself.

17
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:40,818
>> Okay.

18
00:00:40,818 --> 00:00:45,607
>> So GitHub is just a place to store Git repos, repositories. So

19
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:50,775
we actually need the, the software on our computer to, to actually make the

20
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:53,765
Git commits and run all the Git commands.

21
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:57,840
>> Okay. So, should I, does Git have software like that?

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,010
>> So there, there is a get hub specific UI that could

23
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,185
handles Git for you, and it installs Git when you install it. So.

24
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:06,960
>> Okay.

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,240
>> We can go ahead and use the Git gooey.

26
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,736
>> So I'm going to just search for

27
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:13,974
that. What I, what should I search for? GitHub?

28
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:15,091
>> Gui?

29
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:15,553
>> yeah,

30
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:17,721
that'll probably get us there.

31
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:17,782
>> Get us there.

32
00:01:17,782 --> 00:01:20,093
>> [LAUGH]

33
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:21,652
>> Okay, I'll do GitHub for Mac.

34
00:01:21,652 --> 00:01:25,055
>> Yeah, we want the one for Mac.

35
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:29,237
>> Okay, easy enough.

36
00:01:29,237 --> 00:01:30,096
>> There it goes.

37
00:01:30,096 --> 00:01:40,014
>> Alright, so we've downloaded it, unzipped it. Now, let's install.

38
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:41,012
Alright.

39
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:43,436
>> Alright, so we've installed it. We opened it,

40
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,552
and now we have this folder that says My Repositories.

41
00:01:45,552 --> 00:01:48,016
>> Yep. So now we actually need to get our repository

42
00:01:48,016 --> 00:01:48,846
>> Okay.

43
00:01:48,846 --> 00:01:48,930
>> To put in there.
