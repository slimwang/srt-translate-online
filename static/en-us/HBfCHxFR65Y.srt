00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,940
An example of a client class here, might be an out of stock detector. That is,

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,490
you have an application that's going through your inventory,

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:11,270
trying to find places where you might have to reorder. The component class here,

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,640
is inventory item. That is, it's an abstract class of which all of the parts

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,270
subscribe. An example of the leaf class is this stainless steel hex bolt.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,310
An example of a composite class,

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,860
might be the BlueBirdBoxKit. Which is itself made up of other parts.
