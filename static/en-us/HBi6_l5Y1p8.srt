1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,200
Nevertheless, let us continue and

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,370
see how else this theory
enables common sense reasoning.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,210
So consider the sentence,
Ashok enjoy eating the frog.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,770
So not just Ashok ate the frog,
Ashok enjoyed it.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,810
How do we make sense of this term?

6
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:18,160
Once again, because the word eat, we may
have the primitive action for ingest.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,000
Here is Ashok as the agent, frog as the
object, and this time we'll have under

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,150
the slot called result, which shows
what happens when Ashok eats the frog.

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,650
We will call this frame a state-change
frame, where there was some initial

10
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,340
state and some state at the end of this
particular action, the action of ingest.

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,030
So, here there is Ashok's mood,
which is becoming happy.

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,670
>> So Ashok, how would the agent
know that in this case,

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,380
the verb we're going to key on
first is eating instead of enjoyed?

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,590
Good point, David.

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,780
So we can imagine
a different action frame for

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,480
feel because of enjoy being a feel.

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,660
The agent as Ashok.

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,550
Ashok is the one holding the feeling,
and the object, or

19
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,140
the feeling that is being felt, is joy.

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,950
We can still have a frame for eating,
and we can relate those two frames.

21
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,200
So what specific interpretation an agent
will make this particular sentence

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,770
will depend on the precise rules that
we're going to put into this slot so

23
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,660
that the agent can make either this
interpretation or that interpretation.

24
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,300
We'll see another example of
this situation in just a minute.
