00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,680
Sumat, what type of advice could you give students who

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,300
are looking to integrate maps into their data visualizations?

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:12,680
>> So I think maps are a different and difficult category of data to show.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,240
But they can also re, be really powerful.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,600
So I think, like with many other graph types,

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,600
one of the most important things about when you're making a map is,

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,030
to decide in advance what you'd like your audience to know.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,080
And to decide how you're going to show that.

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,890
so, that involves things like, you know,

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,130
deciding what scales you're going to be showing.

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,800
You know, what the variation is.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,030
Making sure that you have a clear outcome, for

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,090
the people who are going to be looking at it.

14
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,520
So, I think a lot of times when you're making any graph,

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,980
it's really useful to think in advance.

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,400
What's it, what's the main thing that I want people to take away, because as

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,670
a data scientist, it would be your job to tell people what they need to know.

18
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,560
>> Hm.

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,370
>> And so, often times it can be useful to do something like, even just like

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,410
titling, or using on of the axis labels to say, what the main takeaway point is.

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,590
And using an annotation to point out what a particular event or an outlier was.

22
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,908
So we have a couple examples up here that we can show.

23
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:18,621
So this one is a, a contour map that's on top of a scatter chart.

24
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:26,458
That shows temperature anomalies in July with respect to 1981 to 2010.

25
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:30,694
And so it lets us see variations between temperatures in very cool and

26
00:01:30,694 --> 00:01:32,180
meaningful ways.

27
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,210
And you can see it scaled from over here, to show differences in temperature.

28
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,620
We also here have a bubble chart that lets you look at,

29
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,080
different sizes of Canadian cities and the population that lives in them.

30
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,740
And so this is a fun one because it lets us just kind of like visually get

31
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,823
a sense for, the overall population of Canada.

32
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:58,190
>> Hm. >> Which you can see is just heavily centered around the border here.

33
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,570
And then also where the most populated cities are.

34
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:06,100
For making these maps folks have used the maps package.

35
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,913
Or a maps library, n r, and then use Basemap from Python.

36
00:02:09,913 --> 00:02:11,260
>> Mm-hm.

37
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,400
>> For making maps if you would like a GUI Tableau and

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,410
Data Wrapper both have really good tools.
