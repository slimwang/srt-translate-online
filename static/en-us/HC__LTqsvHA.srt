00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,508
What we've been looking at for the last few examples is vertex form. Vertex

2
00:00:05,508 --> 00:00:10,360
form indicates the vertex of a parabola, h and k. For parabolas that open up

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,390
and down, the h value is the opposite sign of the one in the binomial, and the

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:20,394
k value is the one on the end. Remember we can always find the x coordinate of

5
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:25,474
this vertex by setting the binomial equal to zero. And if we look at the number

6
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:28,951
in front of the squared term, we can determine whether or not the parabola

7
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:35,140
opens up, or if the parabola opens down. If the a value is positive or greater

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,596
than 0, the parabola opens up. And if the a value is negative, or less than 0,

9
00:00:40,596 --> 00:00:45,622
then the parabola must open down. Horizontal parabolas are a little bit more

10
00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:50,738
tricky. These parabolas start with x equals and either open to the right or to

11
00:00:50,738 --> 00:00:58,482
the left. We find the vertex by looking at h and k. Notice here that h is added

12
00:00:58,482 --> 00:01:03,352
on the end or subtracted in some cases. And k is the number inside the

13
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:08,115
binomial. Notice that h is now the number on the end, where k is the number in

14
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:13,564
the binomial. We can find the y coordinate of the vertex by setting this

15
00:01:13,564 --> 00:01:18,296
binomial equal to zero. The x coordinate of the vertex, for horizontal

16
00:01:18,296 --> 00:01:23,395
parabolas, will just be the number, added or subtracted, on the end. And

17
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:26,915
finally, if the a value was greater than 0 or positive, we know the graph opens

18
00:01:26,915 --> 00:01:32,093
to the right. Whereas if the a value is less than 0, or negative, then our

19
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:34,760
graph opens to the left.
