1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,210
Sensor sizes play a role in all of this too.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,830
Here I'm basically showing you the aspect ratio and

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:11,310
sensor size of a 35 millimeter standard, full frame camera.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,040
So basically this is a 1 to 1 full frame, 35 millimeter, 24 millimeter.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,900
Sensor of course that impacts the field of view of a camera that you use to

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,840
capture images.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,144
Slightly smaller.

8
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:27,878
This is another sensor size that's widely used 28.7 to 19.1.

9
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:31,779
And the aspect ratio is no longer full frame, but 1 to 1.26.

10
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:34,643
This is yet another well known and widely used.

11
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:38,250
The aspect ratio in this one is 1 to 1.5.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,810
These days micro four-third cameras are getting more common and

13
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,600
this is the sensor size for that.

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,590
Of course a micro two-third camera sensor size is this.

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,730
Other sensor sizes exist, 7.25 millimeter to 5.33.

16
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,330
And again, now you notice that we're moving from a much more

17
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:59,500
professional digital SLR all the way to handheld cameras or

18
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,010
pocket cameras or more instant you know, cell phone cameras.

19
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:10,130
This, for example, is a sensor for iPhone 5, 4.54 times 3.52 millimeters.

20
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,930
And of course we can keep on getting other type of sensor sizes.

21
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,830
But you noticed this is a sensor for

22
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,720
a professional camera all the way to kind of what's in mobile phones like this.
