00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, now for a quick quiz.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We have this definition of decorator, and we've seen how that works.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Here's an alternative that was proposed by Darius Bacon,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
which is this1 line--return the function that updates wrapper for the decorator

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
applied to the function from the original function,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and then 1 more line, which says, decorator = decorator of decorator.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Can you get any more recursive than that?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The question is, does this work?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I want you to give me the best answer.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The possible answers are yes, it does; no, it's an error; no, it correctly updates decorator

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
such as n_ary, but not the decorated function such as (seq);

12
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or no, my brain hurts.
