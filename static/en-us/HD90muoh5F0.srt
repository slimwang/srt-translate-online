The final attachment style is secure attachment, and about 65% of babies have a

00:00:04,222 --> 00:00:09,255
secure attachment. Babies with secure attachments cry and become really

00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:13,791
distressed when the caregiver leaves. But when the caregiver returns, the baby

4
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:18,580
offers warm hugs, and the baby will settle down fairly quickly. Attachment is a

00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,130
born with a temperament which can influence how we attach to our caregivers,

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,380
but we also have to consider nurture or the experience our caregivers provide

00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,829
us. This can also affect our attachment to them.
