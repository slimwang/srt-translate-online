1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,830
Inbound marketing refers to the
activities that you do and the content

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,270
that you create that drives people to
come to you and engage with your site,

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,680
your product, or your social channels
rather than having to go out and

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,379
get people's attention by ads or
other outbound marketing activities.

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,880
You're earning the attention
of your customers and

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,200
drawing them in by producing
interesting content.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,600
Then you want to personalize your
content to the needs and wants of your

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,620
target audience, and your going to
want to have multi-channel mindset here.

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,780
With inbound marketing you're going to
need to connect with your users,

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,180
where they are, and where they want
you to connect with them whether

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,090
that be by using your blog,
publishing things on social media,

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,340
your SEO search results, or
even emails you send out.

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,380
Now one thing that's really important
with inbound marketing, and

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,130
frankly with all of your marketing
efforts is making sure you're publishing

15
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:56,090
the right content to the right people
in the right place at the right time.

16
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,720
This intersection will allow your
marketing efforts to be helpful and

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,540
relevant rather than annoying and
repetitive.

18
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,069
Let's go to Greg to talk about his
thoughts on inbound marketing.

19
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,850
>> My name's Greg Brauner.

20
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,140
I'm Head of Marketing, at Udacity.

21
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,250
I've been in marketing for
about 15 years.

22
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,810
Inbound marketing is a set
of activities that you take

23
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,910
to engage with your audience to get
them to come to your site directly.

24
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,780
These are things like blog posts, social
posts, things on Facebook, LinkedIn, and

25
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,010
Twitter that you engage
direct with your audience and

26
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,420
get them to come to your site.

27
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,985
So the content attracting
the user to the site is going

28
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:26,835
to have to be relevant.

29
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:30,405
So for example in Udacity's case we
provide an education platform and

30
00:01:30,405 --> 00:01:32,745
an education service for
you to come and learn from us.

31
00:01:32,745 --> 00:01:35,243
If we were to post things relating to
education that show us thought leaders

32
00:01:35,243 --> 00:01:37,732
or knowing exactly what we're talking
about in the education space, or

33
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:39,995
relevant to topics that
they're interested in they're

34
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:41,135
more likely to come to us.

35
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:44,140
So being an educational platform when
we send out things that are related to

36
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,640
the continuing education for

37
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,120
them, things that we're
launching that are new,

38
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,495
things that are really relevant to why
they came to use in the first place.

39
00:01:49,495 --> 00:01:52,630
If we start out saying things about cats
and muscle cars it's really not what

40
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,510
they want to hear from us and
they'll ignore us pretty quickly or

41
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,070
wonder what the heck
we're doing over here.

42
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,320
So when you look at creating different
types of content what you really want to

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,030
understand is what type of content your
audience really wants to engage with.

44
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,130
There is everything from webcasts
to info-graphics to memes,

45
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,930
but you have to pick the right one for
you and

46
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,850
your audience because they're going
come want to consume in a certain way.

47
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,770
The best way to do that is back
to AB testing is to go ahead and

48
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,730
send out two different messages.

49
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,220
Send out an info-graphic one month and
a meme the next month and

50
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,420
a vine the third month.

51
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,850
See what gets the highest engagement,
and

52
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,480
then from there you can refine
your marketing plan and

53
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,540
determine out what kind of inbound
content you want to spend time on.

54
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,010
So when you look at creating content
you want to make sure you're hitting

55
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,880
the right people with the right content
at the right place at the right time.

56
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,010
Look at Facebook versus Twitter to
get an example of how you engage your

57
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,140
audience differently.

58
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,930
On Facebook you can post
long form content and

59
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,010
engage in a very deep
discussion with your customers.

60
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,060
On Twitter it's a shorter medium right?

61
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,350
So you only have a 140 characters so

62
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,700
you have to really be thoughtful
about what you post, and try and

63
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,510
get them back to your site and
engage with you there.

64
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,920
So when you look at good
quality content and

65
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,960
creating quality content you want
to do it yourself if you can.

66
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,750
You can control the message,
the theme, the colors, the images, and

67
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,940
it's something that really
ties to you and your company.

68
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,780
If you buy content or

69
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,380
syndicate someone else's content you
don't always get what you really want.

70
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,940
I think Virgin America right now is
doing an amazing job with their content

71
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,100
creation and their marketing.

72
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,600
It's unique, it's original,
it's definitely to their brand.

73
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,960
I encourage you to check out their
billboards, and their website.

74
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,720
They've done an amazing job
in creating a fun airline in

75
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,622
a space where it's really
not a lot of fun to fly.

76
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,560
When you look at creating a blog and

77
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,780
a readership there what you really
want to do is have a contact calendar.

78
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,640
Look out a month or two months of what
you want to write, what you want to

79
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,290
talk about, and then figure out
how to get that content created.

80
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,410
So again we're talking
about original content.

81
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,220
What you want to have is
someone creating it for

82
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,620
you in a way that tells your story.

83
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,750
That's the best way to create any
type of sort of blog following.

84
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,640
I would say when you look at publisher
and social you really have to pay

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,580
attention to what channels
you want to engage with and

86
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,130
have time to engage with.

87
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,010
When you look at LinkedIn or
Twitter or Facebook,

88
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,830
which are the three kind of big ones
right now they all have their different

89
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,420
ways people want to interact, and
they want to hear back from you as well.

90
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,430
So example on Twitter don't just post
stuff and never go back to it again.

91
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,330
You want to actually engage
because people will retweet you.

92
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,110
They'll talk to you, ask you questions.

93
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,090
Make sure if you do engage in
social you have time to nurture and

94
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,760
engage that community in the way
that they want to talk to you,
