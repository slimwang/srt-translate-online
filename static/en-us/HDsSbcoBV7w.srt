1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here what I think the best answer is.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The best possibility is that we do have a mathematical proof

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that follows standard rules of deduction that shows that the cipher is secure.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There are very few ciphers that we can actually get that for.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
One actually is the one-time pad.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We'll see later this unit how to prove in a mathematical sense

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
that it has a very strong security property.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The next best one is the last one,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
which is to show in a formal way

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
why this cipher is at least as hard as some other problem.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We'll talk about reduction proofs more later in this course.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The basic premise here is that there is some other problem that we have good reasons

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
to believe is always already hard.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Then we're going to show that if we could break the cipher,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
we could solve that other problem that we already have good reasons to believe is hard.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The next best is this one--

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
that many smart highly-motivated people tried to break but couldn't.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is often the best we can do.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For the best symmetric ciphers that are in use today

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
this is really the reason that they're argued secure.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There may be formal arguments that show why they resist particular attacks,

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and that's part of smart people trying to break ciphers,

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
knowing all the known best-case attacks and trying them against the cipher

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and seeing that the cipher resists them.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But ultimately the best we can do is show that

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
we think it's secure because it has these properties,

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and lots of smart people weren't able to break it.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But that's not a very satisfying way to know it's secure.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We're certainly much rather have the strong mathematical proof.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The worst possible argument here is the key-space argument.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This one is often made incorrectly.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The number of keys gives you an upper bound on the difficulty to break the cipher,

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
because at worst the attacker could try all the keys.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's not true for the one-time pad, as we saw.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Trying keys gives you perfectly sensible messages.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You'll eventually see all possible messages.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You can't know which key is correct.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
For ciphers where the key space is smaller than the message space,

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
you could try keys and have a good likelihood

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
if the key leads to a sensible message, that that's the right message.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This gives you an upper bound on how hard it is to break a cipher.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It doesn't give you a lower bound.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The fact that you have a large number of possible keys doesn't mean the cipher is secure.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We can always add to the key space without increasing the difficulty in breaking a cipher.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We'll see many ciphers with very large key spaces

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
that are completely insecure.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Our best possible argument is to have a mathematical proof.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's what Claude Shannon was able to do for the one-time pad.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's really a fairly unusual case where we can get

50
00:02:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
a mathematical proof that's that strong.
