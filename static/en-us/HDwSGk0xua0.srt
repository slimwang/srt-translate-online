Sometimes students have a hard time determining whether something is

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,610
reinforcement or punishment, or positive reinforcement or negative

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:11,025
reinforcement. The first the easiest thing to do is to say does the behavior

4
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:16,488
increase? If the behavior increases, it's reinforcement. If the behavior

5
00:00:16,488 --> 00:00:20,500
decreases, it's punishment. After you decide that, then go back and look, did

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,370
the behavior increase because something was added to the environment? If so

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,121
that's positive reinforcement. Or did the behavior increase because something

8
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:34,164
was taken away from the environment? If so that's negative reinforcement. And

9
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:37,250
the same for punishment. If behavior decreases, did it decrease because

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,813
something was added to the environment, for example a painful shock? That would

11
00:00:41,813 --> 00:00:45,471
be positive punishment, and removing something from the environment and

12
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:50,408
behavior decreasing would be negative punishment. So first ask, does behavior

13
00:00:50,408 --> 00:00:54,046
increase or decrease? And then ask, did it happen because something was added

14
00:00:54,046 --> 00:00:57,755
to the environment or taken away? You can use this when you're going through

15
00:00:57,755 --> 00:01:00,763
the problem sets, but I encourage you to look at your own life and see examples

16
00:01:00,763 --> 00:01:05,690
of positive and negative punishment, and positive and negative reinforcement.
