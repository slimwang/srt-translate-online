1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,100
So in that example, the thing to realize is

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,611
those two squares that have the same measurement of intensity.

3
00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:08,850
All right?

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:15,250
So seeing is not the same thing as just measuring image properties.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,950
In fact, seeing is called, we refer to it as building a percept,

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,410
a build up a description in your head of what's actually going on there,

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,640
based upon what's in the measurements.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,550
That can be illustrated in a couple of ways.

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,910
Here's one, so this is a very, very old stereoscope.

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,260
This is a slide borrowed from Michael Black.

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,030
And we'll talk about this in detail when we do stereo.

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,520
And if, and the, the stereoscope here is designed so

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,210
that one image goes through one eye, and the other image goes to the other eyes.

14
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,880
So, here they, here they are.

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,780
If you take a look at those two images, this is the left image, and

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,050
this is the right image.

17
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,750
Left, right, left, right.

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,150
It's the difference between those two images that lets your brain realize that

19
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:00,000
the dad holding the kid is in front of the bed where the mom is.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,890
Okay, and it's that difference you're building that

21
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,700
description from the difference between those images.

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,170
So I'm going to show you a video now from Dan Kersten that shows you

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,530
that perception is an active construction on the part of your head.

24
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,210
So here, there's going to be this ball rolling back and

25
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,350
forth, okay, and the ball's going to do the same thing, but

26
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,270
the shadows are going to do something different.

27
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,208
Ready, watch.

28
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,019
Whoa.

29
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:25,830
Okay.

30
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,710
So let's do that again.

31
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,960
So you see the ball, and the shadow goes with it, and

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,650
you see the ball going to the back corner of the checkerboard.

33
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,800
And now, we move the shadow sideways, and you see the ball lifting up.

34
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,330
The ball did the same thing in both cases.

35
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,320
All right?

36
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,560
But your brain, because of the shadow, says the ball did something different.

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,430
So again, that’s not a property of measurement.

38
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,580
So here’s another example.

39
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,230
So what you’re going to see is what looks like a green piece of paper or

40
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,890
something on a checkerboard.

41
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,070
You saw that green thing lift up.

42
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,150
Right? You saw it come right off the checkerboard, right?

43
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,900
Let's do it again, all right?

44
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,530
Here we go, it comes up off the checkerboard, right?

45
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,410
Just look at the top left-hand corner of that green thing,

46
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,870
and you will see that absolutely nothing moves.

47
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,700
None of the green pixels move at all.

48
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,120
The only thing that moves are those darkish pixels,

49
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,640
which your brain says is a cast shadow.

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,960
So that means your brain had to pretend there was some illuminant up in the sky

51
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,440
over here, making these shadows.

52
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,990
And the only explanation is that the,

53
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,140
the green thing came up off the, the, the checkerboard.

54
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,969
So it's another example of your brain doing this construction.

55
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,260
So the previous examples I was showing you,

56
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,850
are in some sense the human system doing something wrong, right?

57
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,620
The ball didn't actually change what it did.

58
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,220
But actually, what happened there is that, there's ambiguity as to what the ball

59
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,860
is doing, and your brain is creating the story, it is making the description,

60
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,530
and the difference between straight image processing and

61
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,360
computer vision is building that description.

62
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,750
And we're going to show you some of the methods that you would use to help do

63
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,480
that construction.
