1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,920
So you should promote everything, right?

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,770
You know, we'll change all the things?

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,870
>> Yeah I think that'd be helpful.

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:05,689
>> No it would not.

5
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,020
>> Okay.
>> 'Kay, like i said earlier,

6
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,830
layer management and compositing are not
free and so this is a balancing act.

7
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,090
There's no magic number of layers that
you should aim for but you are shooting

8
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,650
for no more than two milliseconds in
update layer tree and two milliseconds

9
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,809
in compositing, for 60 frames a second
critical work like animations.

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,430
>> Of course, if you're still going
over that by hitting 60 frames

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,400
per second, that's not bad.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,430
The key is knowing about the tradeoffs
and then finding the right numbers for

13
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,110
your own project.
