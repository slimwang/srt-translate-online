1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay. The answer is: q=on & r=on

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
because those two checkboxes were checked "on"

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and the third one, "s", wasn't checked at all.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's go ahead and check this out on the browser, for real.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Here is our form--just how we left it.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We've got our first two checkboxes checked.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And when I click Submit, we see in the URL:

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
q=on&r=n.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Simple enough. Cool.
