00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,440
One of our goals here at
Udacity is to help you become

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,710
an independent developer.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,140
Not independent in the sense
that you only work alone, but

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:14,310
that you feel empowered to take on new
projects, research unfamiliar ideas,

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,059
and ask questions without our help.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,770
I would like to first go over some of
the types of reference material that

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,510
is available to you on the web,
as well as some strategies

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,250
to help you determine if a resource
will be valuable to use.
