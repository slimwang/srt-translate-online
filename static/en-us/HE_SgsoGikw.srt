1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,340
Now, before we actually do step two, let's have a brief review of what step two actually means.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,660
So, to show that shortest tour is NP-hard, which would then make it NP-complete,

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,060
because we've already shown that it is in NP,

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,330
what do we need to show?

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,390
Do we need to show that the input for some NP-complete problem

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,380
can be transformed into an input for shortest tour.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,710
And, of course, if this input here is a yes for this NP-complete problem,

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,220
then it has to be yes for shortest tour here as well.

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,450
If it's the no it's has to be a no.

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,170
Or do we need to show that the input for shortest tour can be transformed

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,260
into an input for some other NP-complete problem?

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,260
Basically, I would like you to review here which direction these transformations work.

13
00:00:38,260 --> 99:59:59,999
Of course, we'll always make the assumption that the transformation is in polynomial time.
