1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,974
The answer is, ZERO_RESULTS.

2
00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:07,713
ZERO_RESULTS responses occur
when the service request is

3
00:00:07,713 --> 00:00:11,321
successfully passed
through to the server.

4
00:00:11,321 --> 00:00:14,004
It's authenticated, and
a query is executed,

5
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:16,039
but no matching results were found.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,500
As long as you pass an API key and

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,449
have a valid request format,
you can request any address be geocoded.
