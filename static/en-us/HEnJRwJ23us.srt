1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,250
So this is the essence of Bayes' rule, which I'll give to you in a second.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,830
There is some sort of a prior,

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,090
by which we mean the probability before you run a test.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,010
And then you get some evidence from the test itself.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,935
And that all leads you to what's called a posterior probability.

6
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:19,050
Now this is not really a plus operation.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,230
In fact in reality it's more like a multiplication.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,380
But semantically what Bayes Rule does is it incorporates some evidence

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:34,680
from a test into your prior probability to arrive at a posterior probability.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,560
So let's makes this specific.

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,760
In our cancer example we know that the prior probability of

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,648
cancer is 0.01 which is the same as 1%.

13
00:00:44,648 --> 00:00:50,480
The posterior of the probability of cancer given that our test says positive,

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,210
abbreviated here as positive,

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,880
is the product of the prior times our test sensitivity.

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:03,390
Which is, what are the chance of a positive result given that I have cancer.

17
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,940
And you might remember this one was 0.9, or 90%.

18
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,660
Now, just to warn you, this isn't quite correct.

19
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,260
To make this correct we also have to compute the posterior for

20
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,580
the non-cancer option.

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,720
Written here is not cancer, given a positive test.

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,260
And that's using the prior.

23
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,730
We know that P of Not C is 0.99.

24
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,050
It's 1 minus P of C.

25
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:34,350
Times the probability of getting a positive test result given Not C.

26
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,800
Realize these two equations are the same but exchange C for not C.

27
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,750
And this one over here takes a moment to compute.

28
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,620
We know that our test gives us a negative result if it cancer free, 0.9 chance.

29
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,253
And as a result it gives us a positive result in

30
00:01:51,253 --> 00:01:55,330
the cancer free case with 10% chance.

31
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,290
Now, what's interesting, is that this is about the correct equation.

32
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,205
Except the probabilities don't add up to 1.

33
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,990
To see, I'm going to ask you to compute those.

34
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,160
So please give us, give me the exact numbers, for

35
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,060
the first expression, and the second expression, written over here.

36
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,310
Using our example up here.
