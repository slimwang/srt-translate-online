1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,510
So here we're going to show you some example of disparity, okay?

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,870
In the left hand side, you'll see,

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,680
that there is a point, at the bottom of this window, okay?

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,170
And in this image on the right over here, and by the way,

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,240
it took me a while to figure out which image was left and

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,400
which image was right, and I did that by looking right up here at the trees.

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,890
You can see that, in the image on the right, that the chimney has moved to

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,970
the left with respect to the tree behind it, so that's the right image.

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,940
What happened is, if I go to the same location in this image as in

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,770
the first image, I don't land on the window.

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,600
I actually have to move this far, in order to get to that window point.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,770
That's the disparity.

13
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:49,720
And in fact, you can build what's called a disparity map, for every point x, y,

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,340
you can say what's the disparity.

15
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,720
And you'll notice something about this disparity image,

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,630
right, notice that the stuff here is brighter than the stuff there.

17
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,890
Well, I just made an image of disparity, and remember, disparity is

18
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,850
inversely proportional to depth, so the brighter values are the closer zs.

19
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,380
All right.

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,050
And the smaller values are further away, and, the really small values,

21
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,830
which are very dark, are going to be further away yet.

22
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,530
Okay, and that's this notion of, from disparity being able to get to depth.
