00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,702
Great job.

2
00:00:01,702 --> 00:00:05,580
By this point you have started to
analyze the problems that exist in your

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,870
company.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,530
Throughout the standard degree, we'll
dive deeper into typical problems faced

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,110
by companies and
come up with potential solutions.

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,280
In the process,

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,740
you'll learn about spinning up
virtual machines in the cloud,

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,980
using configuration management software,
managing microservices, and more.

9
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:29,110
In the meantime, make sure to submit
Projects Zero for review and feedback.

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,530
Now DevOps is all about
communication and collaboration.

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,500
We put this into practice when
building this nano-degree.

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,290
We have people from Udacity and Google,
people from operations, development,

13
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,200
project management, who agreed to
lend their expertise to the program.

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,010
That said,
it's time to hear from someone new.

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,443
I'm going to pass you along
to my colleague, Carl.

16
00:00:54,443 --> 00:00:58,073
>> Hi, I'm Carl,
a course developer here at Udacity.

17
00:00:58,073 --> 00:00:59,105
In the next lesson,

18
00:00:59,105 --> 00:01:02,393
we'll talk more about the history
of dev ops in the Combs Model.

19
00:01:02,393 --> 00:01:03,010
See you soon.
