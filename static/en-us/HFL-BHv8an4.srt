00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,180
Typically, whenever we're working
with an existing Gradle project,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,830
we'll be using the wrapper,
because that way we can ensure that

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,240
everyone working on the project is
using the same version of Gradle.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,710
For our purposes however, it'd be a bit
of a pain to generate the Gradle wrapper

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,500
scripts for
every single one of these folders, so,

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,340
we'll have you use a local
installation instead.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,339
You can find these instructions in the
course repository under

8
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:24,019
1.02-Exercise-InstallGradle.

9
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:26,930
These instructions will have you first
check that you have got a working Java

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:27,940
installation and

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,720
then we'll walk you through
the process of installing Gradle.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,910
Note that if you're on Mac and

13
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,580
you are a Homebrew user, that's
a very easy way to install Gradle.

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,510
Also on Mac, there is the GVM,
the Groovy Environment Manager, and

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,530
that will also automatically
install Gradle for you.

16
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,520
Those are some good
options to check out.

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,410
So let's walk through the process
of installing Gradle manually.

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,710
First let's check that we have
a working Java installation.

19
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,610
Looks like we're good to go here.

20
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,990
If you don't have a working Java
installation there are instructions for

21
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,590
how to install that in
the course repository.

22
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,440
Now we need to download Gradle.

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,650
Head on over to
Gradle.org/downloads to do so.

24
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,610
We want the complete distribution.

25
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,140
Once we have the Gradle complete
distribution downloaded,

26
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,720
we need to do a bunch of other
things to get Gradle installed.

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,060
We need to move it to an appropriate
place on our machine, our suggestion is

28
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,480
user local Gradle, and then we also
need to add a few environment variables.

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,720
You can do all of this by yourself,
however, if you just paste in this

30
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,890
giant block of script into your console,
that'll do it all automatically.

31
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,120
All right, here goes nothing.

32
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,930
There we go.

33
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,790
Gradle has been extracted to user local
Gradle, and now we're ready to rock.

34
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,160
By the way,
if that last command complained,

35
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,930
you might need to run it with sudo.

36
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,010
All right.

37
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,070
Let's see if Gradle installed correctly.

38
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,290
Hey, there we go, that's looking good.

39
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,860
Gradle 2.3, ready for action.
