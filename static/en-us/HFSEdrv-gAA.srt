Thanks, Chris, for teaching us how to add
and subtract fractions and finding the

2
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:10,193
least common denominator. Now let's

00:00:10,205 --> 00:00:14,807
a pretty easy problem. We're going to try
7 12ths plus 3 8ths. You can put your

4
00:00:14,818 --> 00:00:00,000
answer for the numerator in that box and
the denominator is that box. Good luck.
