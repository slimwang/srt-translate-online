00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,310
In this lesson we have introduced
the P versus NP problem.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,090
As we said in the beginning, the class
P informally captures the problems

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,190
we can solve efficiently on a computer,
and the class NP

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,510
captures the problems whose answers we
can verify efficiently on a computer.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,110
Our experience with finding a clique in
a graph is just that these two classes

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,310
are not the same.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,150
Cliques are hard to find,
but they are easy to check.

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,300
Intuitively solving a difficult
problem should be harder

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,470
than just checking a solution.

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,439
Nevertheless, no one has been able
to prove that P is not equal to NP.

11
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,720
Whether these two classes are equivalent
is known as the P versus NP question and

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,040
is the most important problem in
theoretical computer science today.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,140
If not in all of mathematics.

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,280
We'll discuss the full implications
of the question in a later lecture.

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,110
But for now,
I'll just mention that in the year 2000,

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,430
the Clay Mathematics Institute
named the P versus NP problem

17
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,220
as one of the seven most important
open questions in mathematics.

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,290
And has offered a $1 million bounty for
a proof that determines whether or

19
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,790
not P equals NP.

20
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,239
Fame and fortune await the person that
settles the P versus NP problem, but

21
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,319
many have tried and failed.

22
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,500
Next class we look at
the NP complete problems.

23
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,970
The hardest problems in NP.
