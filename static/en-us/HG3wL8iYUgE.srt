Let's return to our Alice in Wonderland example for a minute. What if I want to

2
00:00:03,202 --> 00:00:07,310
write a program that finds interesting words that occur in the book? A lot of

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,673
the time shorter words are more common words. Maybe longer words are more

4
00:00:11,673 --> 00:00:15,860
interesting, and more likely to be related to the exact topic of the book. We

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,664
could write a program that would help us test this. Let's write a program that

6
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:23,615
finds the first word in Alice in Wonderland that's longer than nine characters.
