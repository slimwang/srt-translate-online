Hi and welcome to Udacity's machine
learning engineer nanodegree program.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,410
My name is David Joyner.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,790
I'm a course developer with Udacity,

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,890
as well as an instructor
over at Georgia Tech.

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,300
And I'm thrilled to bring you this
program because machine learning is

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,070
really at the core of many innovations
going on in lots of different areas.

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,175
Finance, education, healthcare.

8
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:19,247
These are all industries that are being
revolutionized every day by what

9
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:21,040
machine learning can do.

10
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,930
And in this nanodegree program, you're
going to develop your own understanding

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,670
of what machine learning can do for
these areas as well.

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,350
Over the course of this program
you're going to be covering the major

13
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,790
schools of thought in machine learning.

14
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,030
You're going to be using the same tools,

15
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,730
the same methods, the same
algorithms that experts are using

16
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,200
everyday to uncover new information
about different industries.

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,272
By the end of this program, you'll have
developed a portfolio that demonstrates

18
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:43,469
what you can do,
the kinds of problems you can address,.

19
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,081
Including some problems
we've picked out for you,

20
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:47,720
as well as some problems you'll
get to pick out for yourself.

21
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,210
I'm excited to get started,
and I hope you are too.
