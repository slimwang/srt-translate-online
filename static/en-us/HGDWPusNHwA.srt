00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,300
Whenever I'm learning a new framework,
I never quite feel like

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,290
I've really got it set up until I
can start making changes myself.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,930
So before we quit for the day,
let's make one simple change.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,293
That background seemed a little too,
well, orange.

5
00:00:15,293 --> 00:00:17,840
Let's swap that out for a nice blue.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,390
If you open up the TODO pane down
at the bottom of Android Studio,

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,457
you can see that there's a to do item
to make this UDACITY_BLUE instead.

8
00:00:26,672 --> 00:00:29,110
Let's double-click on that to
see what it's talking about.

9
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,350
So now we're in the actual game code
itself which we haven't talked at

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,930
all about yet.

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,970
We'll be getting into that next level.

12
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,577
But looks like there's a TODO to
make this UDACITY_BLUE instead.

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,250
Think you can take care of that?

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,010
Go ahead and make this first project
your own by swapping out these colors.

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,600
Open up the TODO pane in Android Studio.

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,670
Double click on the TODO make
this UDACITY_BLUE instead item.

17
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,410
Follow those instructions.

18
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,270
Then try launching the Desktop
run configuration to see the new

19
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,310
game running on your desktop, and

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,180
run it on your phone again and
enjoy the nice blue color.

21
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,350
By the way, if you can't quite
figure out how to do this, there'll

22
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,540
be a solution video following this quiz
that shows you exactly how to do it.

23
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,270
So, if you run in to any troubles,
just hit view answer and

24
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:14,970
I'll show you how to do it.
