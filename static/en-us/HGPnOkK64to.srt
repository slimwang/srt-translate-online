1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,250
All right, that ends this lesson.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,846
What we've done so far is we've derived how the extrinsics and

3
00:00:05,846 --> 00:00:09,880
the intrinsics are combined to form a single calibration matrix.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,860
And this matrix maps from some arbitrary world coordinate all the way down to

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,820
a pixel value.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,230
What, you know, some x, y,

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,720
z in the world, what UV does it end up in the, in the image.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,950
All right?

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,030
So what are we going to do in the next lesson?

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,060
Well, the obvious thing in the next lesson is,

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,240
how would you go about finding that matrix, all right?

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,575
And basically, the requirement's going to be, if I gave you the location of some

13
00:00:35,575 --> 00:00:40,320
3-D points in space, and I gave you the location of those points in the image,

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,960
I should be able to recover that camera calibration matrix.

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,010
And that's what we're going to do next time.

16
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,300
And then, a couple of times after that, we'll say, well if we're less interested

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,180
in going from a world coordinate system to a camera coordinate system, but

18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,230
instead, we're interested in going from one camera coordinate system to another,

19
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,840
remember that stereo thing?

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,710
How would we do that calibration?

21
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,540
But first, we go from the world to the image.
