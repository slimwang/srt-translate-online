00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,080
The key to D3's magic is in the selection before the data binding,

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,350
the data binding itself, and the selection after the data has been bound,

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,560
in this case the .enter selection, which is actually a very special type

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,760
of select which we then eventually add shapes or

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,230
circles, SVG, or HTML to our page for every element in this enter selection.

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:32,090
Many tutorials out there gloss over this detail of what exactly is the enter,

7
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,410
at least to start off.

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,240
But I think once you have a solid understanding of the data join,

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,550
these selections that come after data join, much of the rest of the library,

10
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,410
d3 that is, and the complexities involved with adding interaction and

11
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,972
animation to your graphic fall into place quite nicely.

12
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:56,480
Mike Bostock, the creator of d3, has one of the best posts on the subject,

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,670
not surprisingly, and it's titled Thinking with Joins.

14
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,720
I'll take a short diversion to explain what a join actually is and

15
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,830
what it means in the context of d3.
