00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,010
Since we're monitoring one 2 to the 16th of the entire

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,630
internet, or 1 over 65,535 of the total internet, we simply need

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,760
to take the rate that we've observed and invert that. In

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,590
this case, that rate would be roughly 6.5 billion packets per second.
