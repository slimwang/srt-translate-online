I'm going to ask a slight variation on this question.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This time you're given e and n and the question is is it hard to compute d.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The answers are yes, otherwise it would mean RSA is insecure

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
or no we can just compute the totient of n on the multiplicative inverse using

5
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
using the extended Euclidean algorithm.
