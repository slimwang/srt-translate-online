1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,819
What answer did you come up with, David?

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:03,570
Is two the correct answer?

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,420
>> So
I said that that was the correct answer.

4
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,300
It looks to me like the relationships
at play in frame A and

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,650
frame C are the same.

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,400
And the relationships at play in
frame B and frame 2 are the same.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,660
We saw that x was unchanged between
the two frames, just as r is.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,230
Y expanded, just s does.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,220
And z was deleted, just as t is.

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,330
Similarly, y was above x,
just as s is above r.

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,010
So I think it's the right answer.

12
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,330
>> Good David,
that's in fact the correct answer.

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,930
Two is the best choice of a level here.

14
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,240
But imagine that for 2 s row,
the match between the representation

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,000
on the left side and the representation
on the right side was only partial.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,360
Just like it was when
we had five over here.

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,581
How then would we make a choice
between two and five, David?

18
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:52,461
>> So it sounds like so

19
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:56,149
far we've been talking about an
all-or-nothing match of transformations.

20
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:59,643
But if we didn't have an exact
match between the transformations,

21
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,584
we'd have to come up with some
way to evaluate how well two

22
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:05,230
transformations actually fit together.

23
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,920
So we might say that these
transformations are 95% similar,

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,280
while these two are only 70% similar.

25
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,890
So that would allow us to
choose one over the other.

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,880
>> That sounds fair.

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,290
In fact, we'll come across
something like this very soon.
