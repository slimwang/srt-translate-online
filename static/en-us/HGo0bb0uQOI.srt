00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,105
Let's start by finding the degree of each term in either polynomial. So I'll go

2
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:07,893
ahead and do that right now. Once we figure out the degree of each term in

3
00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:11,809
either expression, we rearrange those terms that the term with the highest

4
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:15,661
degree comes first and then the rest of the terms go in order of decreasing

5
00:00:15,673 --> 00:00:21,001
degree. So for this top polynomial, we'll need the terms to go in order of

6
00:00:21,013 --> 00:00:26,257
degree from 3 to 2 to 1 to 0. So that's going to give us 32x cubed minus 16x

7
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:31,823
squared minus 7x plus 12. We can do the same thing for the second polynomial.

8
00:00:31,942 --> 00:00:37,471
Written in standard form, this polynomial is negative 12x to the 7th plus 3x

9
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:41,968
squared plus 64x. X. Now that we have them written in this way, we can see right

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,567
off the bat that this top polynomial is a third degree polynomial and this

11
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:49,347
bottom one is a seventh degree one. So, standard form definitely makes our job

12
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,663
easier. Remember that standard form is something that applies to all

13
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:56,418
polynomials, not just ones with single variables or ones with just x's. You'll

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,400
get more practice with other polynomials in standard form later.
