1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,490
So which of these would be appropriate
for a parent-to-child transition?

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,360
Transition A was far too slow.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,860
Transition C was all over the place and
kind of hard to follow.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,880
So that leaves us with transition B.
