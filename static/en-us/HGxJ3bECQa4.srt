1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,330
For product form, it's important to
remember that your competitors offer

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,510
nearly the exact same thing as you do.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,758
So we found a competitor
that did just that.

4
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:12,081
They had a few small differences,
such as allowing the sitters to stay

5
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:15,770
in the owners home rather than
the dog going to the sitters home.

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,300
Now for product category,

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,310
it's important to remember that
the scope was a little bit larger.

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,699
Now your competitors here don't do
the exact same thing you do, but

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,006
are pretty close.

10
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:25,528
So for

11
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:30,850
aBARKment, the local dog kennel is our
main competitor at the category level.

12
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,140
It's more like a hotel for dogs rather
than having your dog stay in a home

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,920
with someone, and
it's a little bit more expensive.
