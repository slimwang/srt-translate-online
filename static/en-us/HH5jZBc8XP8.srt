00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,340
Before we go on, let's do a simple and

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,080
quick review of what we have looked at so far.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,650
We have looked at the concept of images and

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,330
cameras as they form the foundations of computational photography.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,570
We have discussed at length how rays of light go through a camera, and

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,670
then register on the sensor to be able to give us an image.

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,230
We've looked at how aperture and all of the different parameters or different

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:29,860
controllable quantities within a camera are used to generate an optimal image.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,049
Then we have studied how a sensor or

10
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:36,000
a film, converts the light information into an image.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,030
Which then we have discussed how we can actually convert to digital

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,370
information in case of a sensor.

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,160
And then of course, we have learned about how we can process an image to

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,780
be able to take something like this and find interesting, and information

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,950
theoretic features out of it that we can use for a variety of things.
