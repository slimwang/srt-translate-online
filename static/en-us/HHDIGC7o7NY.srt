1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,450
So let’s follow our Jersey Square team and

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,014
see what they did with customer segments.

3
00:00:05,014 --> 00:00:06,647
Now, what happened is, they got out of the

4
00:00:06,647 --> 00:00:09,794
building and this time, after they spoke to

5
00:00:09,794 --> 00:00:12,892
a series of customers, they spoke to over 60.

6
00:00:12,892 --> 00:00:14,193
And what they found out was what they

7
00:00:14,193 --> 00:00:16,041
originally thought was a single customer

8
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,358
segment actually turned out to be there

9
00:00:18,358 --> 00:00:21,276
were two separate segments. It turned out

10
00:00:21,276 --> 00:00:23,775
there were the original segment they thought,

11
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:26,311
rabid sports jersey owners, who were male,

12
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:29,092
13 to 35, who passionately followed their

13
00:00:29,092 --> 00:00:31,359
team and went to a lot of games. But there

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,841
were also people who casually attended

15
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:35,041
games. Male and female and they kind of

16
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:39,848
were closer to 18-30 and they were casual fans.

17
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:41,565
So number one, as you can now see that

18
00:00:41,565 --> 00:00:44,221
there are not only two customer segments,

19
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:46,989
but there are two value propositions, that is,

20
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:49,486
there is a value proposition that matches

21
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:52,537
each one of the segments and there’s a

22
00:00:52,537 --> 00:00:55,893
revenue stream that matches each one of the

23
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:57,624
segments. And so now you could kind of

24
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,191
see the power of the canvass. This is a

25
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:02,791
multi-sided market. You have at least two

26
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,465
customers segments and you have two

27
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,429
value props and attending revenue streams.

28
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:10,214
Now you should notice what the Jersey

29
00:01:10,214 --> 00:01:12,949
Square team did wonderfully, they actually

30
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:14,915
started with the archetype. The archetype

31
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:18,095
though, if you remember is, kind of the end

32
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:20,312
result of understanding the pain and the

33
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:23,114
gain we were solving with the value

34
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:25,393
proposition. So they really were missing

35
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:28,776
talking about gains and pains over here as well.

36
00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:30,745
And it would have been great if they had

37
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:32,774
that added in, but a pretty good job in

38
00:01:32,774 --> 00:01:34,628
trying to understand what their archetype

39
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,815
was which need to match their

40
00:01:36,815 --> 00:01:40,815
minimum viable product over here.
