1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,440
You now have an understanding of how
endpoints simplifies dealing with

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,280
authentication.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,120
There are a couple things you have to
do to make sure authentication works,

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,080
not only in your development environment
on local host, but also on F-spot.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,900
To do both of these,
you'll go to your developers console at

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,645
console.developers.google.com/project
and select your project name.

7
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:21,395
The first thing you'll need to do
is to configure your App's user

8
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:24,185
consent screen.a Google won't
tell your app anything about

9
00:00:24,185 --> 00:00:25,955
the user without the user's consent.

10
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:29,447
So, the user will have to accept this
consent screen before the app can work.

11
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:31,487
This screen will display
your app's name and

12
00:00:31,487 --> 00:00:33,437
give the user a chance
to know what's going on.

13
00:00:33,437 --> 00:00:37,327
So, go to APIs & auth,
and then Consent screen.

14
00:00:37,327 --> 00:00:40,627
Select an email address that you
want to associate with the app.

15
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:41,727
And, put in a product name.

16
00:00:41,727 --> 00:00:44,587
And, that will be displayed over
on the user consent screen when

17
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:45,970
the user logs in.

18
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,810
Second, you need to make sure that your
app's front end will be allowed to

19
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,930
access the backend.

20
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,320
To do this, under API and
auth, go to Credentials.

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,630
In the Auth section say,
Create New Client ID.

22
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,660
Then, pick Web application, and
under Authorized JavaScript Origins,

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,540
change the URL field
to contain two URL's.

24
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,930
One for the https URL of your appspot
app, and one for your local host,

25
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,310
including the correct
port your server runs.

26
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,390
Bearing in mind, if it's the second
app you have running on local host,

27
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,250
because you still have the hello app
running, it'll be 9080 instead of 8080.

28
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,620
Now, copy this client ID value.

29
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,190
Yes, this big long noisy string
that ends in googleusercontent.com.

30
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,420
And open up settings.py.

31
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,760
And, put it here under Web_Client_ID.

32
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,670
In the next exercise, you'll get some
practice adding functionality to

33
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,960
the Conference Central app.

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,490
Previously, we used dummy data in
the get profile from user function.

35
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,370
Instead, you'll now be able to get
the data from the logged in user, and

36
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,340
create a profile for them.
