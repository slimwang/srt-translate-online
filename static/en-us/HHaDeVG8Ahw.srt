1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,800
Okay, I know my cell is doubling every time so I have two and then there's seven

2
00:00:04,812 --> 00:00:09,200
rounds of doubling. So I have 2 to the 7th. Here are my seven two's. I'm going

3
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:13,950
to group them and them and then I'm going to group these. So I have 16 times 8.

4
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:18,075
I know 8 times 6 is 48, so I put an 8 and carry the 4. 8 times 1 is 8 plus 4 is

5
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:22,900
12, so 128. So if I start from one cell, after seven rounds of division there

6
00:00:22,912 --> 00:00:23,725
would be 128.
