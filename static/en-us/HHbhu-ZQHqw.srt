1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So now it's time for the first quiz about mutation.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In a previous quiz, we defined the variable stooges

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
to hold 3 strings, strings Moe, Larry and Curly.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But in some of the Stooges films,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Curly was replaced by Shemp,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so your goal for this quiz is to write 1 line of code

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that changes the value of stooges to be the list containing 3 strings,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Moe, Larry, and Shemp,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but doesn't create any new list object.
