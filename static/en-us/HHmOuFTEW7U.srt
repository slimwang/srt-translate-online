1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,150
Another set of examples are this.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,260
So here, basically, what I want to do is I want to now merge two images.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,950
I have a background image, and a foreground image, and this is basically showing

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:13,760
you the UI, that by taking pixels from the background and the foreground, I can

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,140
now find a best possible seam that lets me merge these two images together.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,410
Let's look at this example again.

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,600
I have a original source image and a target image.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,710
this, of course, is a blurry, you know, stream.

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,690
And then I want to, on top of it, put this raft.

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,810
What I do is, of course, take the source image.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,970
And we have a nice UI for doing this.

12
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,590
And I basically say, take all the pixels from this image here.

13
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,540
But now, take this image.

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,420
But in this case, take the pixels from just the region I'm touching.

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,340
Find all the similar ones from there.

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,320
And of course, what it does, it finds the best possible seam and

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,820
blends it together.

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,070
Now, for those of you who are very good at this, you may notice that yes,

19
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,030
this is not the best possible photographic output, because there's blur in

20
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,550
the water and sharp water here, but this is just to prove the point.

21
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,430
It can really, just by doing simple two clicks here,

22
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,464
generate a new image by merging, and but

23
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:10,060
it can find the best possible seam between one image to the other.

24
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,190
So just to show this in detail, I have two images.

25
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,260
I generate this image, but basically what has best happened is that we have

26
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,800
actually found a seam between these two images that lets me merge them.

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,070
And again, you see my problem here with blurry and sharp water.
