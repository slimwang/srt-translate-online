1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,220
So switching over to Android studio,

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:08,180
we need to do a couple of steps before
we can extract a palette from an image.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,020
The first thing we need to do
in our apps build.grade file

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,515
is to add the support library for
palette as a dependency.

5
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:20,475
So after we get our resource identifier
for our image, we can convert

6
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:25,605
that into a Bitmap, that the palette
will use to generate the color swatches.

7
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:28,540
These color swatches fall
into two different areas.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,008
Either a vibrant color or a muted color.

9
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:37,680
The type in number swatches is dependent
on the composition of your image and

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,870
how much of it is in a certain color and

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,770
how that contrasts to
other colors in the image.

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,600
If you want more information for that,
you can check the source code for

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,150
the palette library.

14
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:53,970
So right here in this code,
I take a palette and I'm looking through

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,750
all of the different swatches to see if
they exist because they can be null and

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,660
then I return that map.

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,450
So if we want to see this on a device,
make a little app here

18
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:09,010
that can show an image and
pull out the palette information.

19
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,300
So let's hit this floating action
button down here and pick an image,

20
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,580
and let's pick one of the images from

21
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:25,990
our Android kick off, and we can see
that it's created a palette for us.

22
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,960
Now, the interesting colors here,
I'd say, is the vibrant color

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,900
that it's picking up from
these Android stickers
