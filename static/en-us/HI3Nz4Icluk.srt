00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,876
So tell us how you got involved in GPU's with the first place.

2
00:00:02,876 --> 00:00:06,200
>> It goes way back; I was actually an undergrad.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,329
I was working on some of the original SGI Octanes with OpenGL

4
00:00:11,329 --> 00:00:16,950
and discovering that actually some of those OpenGL Octane machines for doing graphics--

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,036
you know, the kinds of image processing you do in OpenGL

6
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:24,212
could actually be used for simple computational things like fluid flow.

7
00:00:24,212 --> 00:00:28,709
So 1 of my undergraduate theses was to study fluid flow and simulation

8
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:31,784
in the OpenGL pipeline on an old SGI Octane,

9
00:00:31,784 --> 00:00:35,129
and then went on to Stanford, did a few other things but came back to it eventually

10
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:37,334
and that built a career out of it.
