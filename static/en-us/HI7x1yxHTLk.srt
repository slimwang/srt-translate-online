1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,096
In the example shown here, remember we
talked about a feature space that may be

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,780
four by four by four for RGB?

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,731
Well they did 16 by 16 by 16, and

4
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:13,170
then they manually selected
a target on the first frame.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,160
So you can see here that, see this
ellipse that's been put down here,

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,568
and this ellipse that's
been put down there?

7
00:00:19,568 --> 00:00:22,640
They, they specified that in advance and
they said, go, and

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,830
that one starts going, and I guess they
go here, and that one starts going.

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,640
And I want you to notice,
whoops lets get rid of the,

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,650
how well those mean shift models
stick to the players, okay?

11
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,570
The average number of
iterations was only four,

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,480
that is from one frame to another,
they had to move,

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,030
do the mean shift thing four
times to track the density.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,830
They also worried about scale, in terms
of looking at how the the scale changed.
