1
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:50,789
about. >> That sounds right David. There are sort of several other things to

2
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,930
note here. What is the last sentence that has two verbs in it? Decided and

3
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,030
go. You'll see in a minute, how we can deal with sentences or

4
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,450
stories that have multiple verbs in them. Second, you are right in

5
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,940
that it is not always very easy to decide which is the best primitive action for

6
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,940
capturing the meaning of a particular verb here.

7
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,300
So the verb here was pushed, and the reason David propelled or

8
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,340
moved object is because in propulsion the body is in some sense in

9
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,990
contact with the particular object that is getting moved. Now we are not sure

10
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,880
inherently detailed specification of each of one of these primitive actions. But

11
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,790
I can tell you that the readings at the end do give them in detail
