00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,350
The answer is that he's keeping a separate view for

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,670
each cat, and showing and hiding them.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,170
Let's take a look at Andy's HTML.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:13,570
It looks like he hard coded all five buttons, and all five cats, down here.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,060
Now if we had asked him for 15 cats, this would be a very long file.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,110
The other thing to notice is that he doesn't have a single area to show the cat.

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,910
Every cat has its own view, if you will.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,640
And as I mentioned before, if something bad happened and somehow two of these

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,750
were shown at the same time, that could break the way the application looks.
