00:00:00,261 --> 00:00:03,410
The correct answer for this formula is 1, 3, 3, 1

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,970
and you plug them in, you can see it’s correct.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,301
This is actually called a Pascal Triangle. If you

4
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:10,176
have never seen this before, you can check it on

5
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:14,176
Wikipedia. It’s actually quite easily calculated.
