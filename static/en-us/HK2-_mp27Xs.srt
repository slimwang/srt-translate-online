00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,390
Let's discuss an example of SPD and
SADB.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,420
Recall that in transfer mode,
the traffic is protected end to end,

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,830
whereas internal mode,
the traffic is protected

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,160
between the gateway of one network
to the gateway of another network.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,780
First, let's consider the end to end,
or transfer mode policy from A to B.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,950
Suppose the policy says that for

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,810
any traffic from A to B,
the packets need to be authenticated.

8
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:30,870
And further,

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:36,800
the suggested algorithm is to use HMAC
with MD5 as the embedded hash function.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,850
This policy is stored
as an entry in SPD.

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,940
The negotiated parameters, again A and

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,710
B, are store in SA in both A and
B's SADB.

13
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:54,340
For A's SADB,
it stores a secret key for HMAC and

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,840
SPI for looking up the SA in B's SADB.

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:05,450
Then when A sends out traffic to B it
can include this SPI in the IPsec header

16
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:10,720
so that B can use it to look up
the SA and un-process the traffic.

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,260
Now let's take a look at
the tunnel mode traffic

18
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,190
from the subnet that A belongs to,
to the subnet that B belongs to.

19
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:24,260
Suppose the policy says that for any
traffic From A's subnet to B's subnet,

20
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,400
the tunnel's destination
is B's gateway which is D,

21
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,820
and the data should be encrypted,
therefore ESP should be used,

22
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,080
and further, 3DES is requested.

23
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,110
Since C is the gateway of
the subnet that A belongs to,

24
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,010
C's SPD stores this policy.

25
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,865
And its SADB stores the SA
that has a 3DES key.

26
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:51,940
And SPI, for
looking up SA in these SADB.
