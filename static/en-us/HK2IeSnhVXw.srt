00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
To fill the ray called energy, we go through all steps which is one more than you may think.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The equation as such isn't really surprising.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This time for the first time to use a line break, which is a break slash.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What the results tells us is that energy keeps increasing.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
With every orbit, there's a gain in energy and that's pretty much visible in the trajectory,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
which of course is not the actual physical trajectory.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The trajectory keeps expanding and expanding so the long-term behavior of this orbit is pretty poor.
