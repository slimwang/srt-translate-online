00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,080
In this lesson, we will discuss storage
systems such as hard drives and

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,450
how they're connected to
the rest of the computer.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,270
This will help us understand
why they are so much slower but

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,280
can store so
much more data than the main memory.
