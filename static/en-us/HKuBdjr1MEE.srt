00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,010
Let's look at the solution for our speed doubling quiz. This is a period of

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,194
36 years. If speed doubles every two years, that means that

3
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:15,255
the speed has doubled 18 times. So, we have 2 to the 18th

4
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:19,917
times 380. And if you multiply this out, it

5
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:26,030
amounts to about 99 million kilometers per hour and change.

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,830
In reality, the speed record for trains has not even doubled between

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,001
1971 and 2007. The fastest thing that humankind ever built

8
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:44,290
is the Voyager one probe. And its top speed was 62,000 kilimeters per hour.

9
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:50,844
If trains, since 197, followed speed doubling of processors,

10
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:55,490
trains should have moved this fast by 1996.

11
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,185
So, as you can see, processors are one of

12
00:00:58,185 --> 00:01:01,573
those rare things that have observed speed doubling

13
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:05,190
continuously for many years and are still doing that.
