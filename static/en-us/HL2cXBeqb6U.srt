00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,090
A controlled experience is kind of
the Holy Grail of scientific research.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,650
In human subjects research, a controlled
experiment is where we get some

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,450
participants, randomly assign
them to certain conditions and

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,560
then treat each condition
in a different way.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,660
What we do to each condition
is called a treatment and

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,250
then each group of participants
is called a condition.

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,840
Typically we have
a control condition and

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,310
an experimental condition where
the experimental condition

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,100
is where we're trying out something
that we're interested in.

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,260
Controlled experiments give really,
really nice generalizable and

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,380
clean results, but they're also
very difficult to do in education.

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,150
Usually in education,
we're working in real classrooms,

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,460
where we don't have the power
to randomly assign people.

14
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,870
And usually we'll want to do things that
last several weeks or several months.

15
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,000
And it's difficult to control for

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,320
everything when we're doing
controlled experiments.

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,768
But if you're interested in doing
a controlled experiment, in this lesson

18
00:00:43,768 --> 00:00:45,948
we'll talk about the different
things that you need to be aware of,

19
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:47,479
different tools that
are available to you, and

20
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,260
different things you need to
make sure to control for.
