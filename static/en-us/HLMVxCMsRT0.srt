1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,340
So how'd all the logging code go?

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,370
>> It went great, I'm actually having
a launch party for version three soon.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,670
Let me show you all the screens and
features we made from the wireframes.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,780
We're now supporting email login and
Google login.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,560
We also created a pretty
cool reset password flow

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,940
where users are sent their
passwords via email and

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,390
therefore verifying that they actually
own the email that they've given us.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,360
But we worked on more than just
login in this version of the app.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,470
We used the login data to change
what the app actually looks like.

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,250
The app now controls what the user sees
based on who they are logged in as.

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,150
Also, we can keep track of who
buys what items and allow for

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,140
users to signal that they're
actively shopping on a list.

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,480
>> Yeah, and now we're halfway
through our projected final launch.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,110
Anyways, we're having a little 0.3
launch party, you should come.

15
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,190
>> I'll see what I can do.
