1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,583
In order to figure out how things
are moving in the image, okay.

2
00:00:05,583 --> 00:00:08,690
This is, this is how they
are moving in the world.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,408
In order to figure out how
they are moving in the image,

4
00:00:11,408 --> 00:00:14,375
we have to go from world
coordinates to image coordinates.

5
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,500
Okay.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,748
Here's our simple equation for,
in a font that is to small to read, but

7
00:00:18,748 --> 00:00:20,167
it will get bigger in a minute.

8
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:21,210
It's okay.

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,708
We're just going to use straight
perspective projection.

10
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,389
We're going to assume
the origin is in the middle,

11
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:28,000
we're going to assume nothing is skewed,
etc.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,625
So the only thing is is that we
need to know the focal length.

13
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:36,458
So little x is the focal length times
big X over big Z, same thing with y.

14
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:37,460
Right?
That's our

15
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,958
usual perspective transformation.

16
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,210
Okay.

17
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,923
That's X and Y, but
what about how X and Y are changing,

18
00:00:45,923 --> 00:00:49,042
given how how the points are moving?

19
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:50,792
Given the V in the world?

20
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:53,140
Well, it turns out that's pretty easy.

21
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,792
We're going to call little u and
little v here.

22
00:00:56,792 --> 00:01:00,293
The velocity in x and the velocity in y.

23
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:04,290
So these are just the derivatives in
time, so this is how things are changed.

24
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,708
So u is the velocity in x,
dx, dt, y is v is dy, dt.

25
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:10,542
All right?

26
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:15,250
Well, so to take the derivative
of x with respect to something.

27
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,240
In this case, time.

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,792
Right?

29
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:17,940
How it's moving.

30
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,459
Well, you remember, the,
the formula for the derivative of a,

31
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:24,000
of a quotient, right?

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,375
Meg is saying, thank God.

33
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,840
No, I don't have to know these things.

34
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,543
Well, it's just the derivative of
the top times the bottom minus

35
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:32,750
the derivative of the bottom times the
top all divided by the bottom squared.

36
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,250
Right?

37
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:33,792
Right.

38
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:34,490
Okay.

39
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,458
That's what this is, right here, okay?

40
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:40,499
Vx, that's the, that's the change,
that's the velocity in x times Z minus

41
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:44,172
the top, X times the velocity in Z
divided by Z squared multiplied by f,

42
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:45,960
that's just the constant.

43
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,083
Same thing down below, okay?

44
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,377
Then we start to expand this stuff and

45
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:53,620
we get this nice little formula here,
okay?

46
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,556
So when you look at it, that's still
kind of ugly, because you don't actually

47
00:01:58,556 --> 00:02:02,917
know what Vx, Vz and Vy, you,
you know that they're from back here.

48
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:07,107
Well, it turns out, you can write
them pretty beautifully for

49
00:02:07,107 --> 00:02:12,170
some twisted definition of beauty
in this very simple formula here.

50
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:17,025
1 over Z at some point x,
y times A times T plus B x,

51
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:21,904
y of omega and
let me show you exactly what that is.

52
00:02:21,904 --> 00:02:23,084
Okay?

53
00:02:23,084 --> 00:02:25,020
So here, I've rewritten it.

54
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,746
So this is the motion, so u is how much
it's moving at some point x, y, so

55
00:02:29,746 --> 00:02:32,083
we know the point x, y in the image.

56
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,900
The question is how much
motion are we seeing?

57
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,667
So we've got the u and the v, that's
the motion in x and the motion in y.

58
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:39,630
All right?

59
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,746
And what it does is this formula
relates the translation and

60
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:47,792
rotational component of the point
out there in the world.

61
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,720
These are world T and world omega.

62
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,208
Two, how it's moving in the image?

63
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:53,708
Okay?

64
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:01,583
Thing to realize is that this quantity
A is just a function of things we know.

65
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:05,071
We know, we're assuming we know the
focal length of the lens and if we're at

66
00:03:05,071 --> 00:03:08,360
some point x, y, we know what that
point, this is little x, little y.

67
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,208
This is the location in the image.

68
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,220
Cap X, cap Y, cap Z, out in the world.

69
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,250
Little x, little y in the image.

70
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,090
All right?

71
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,750
So you'll notice that
A is just this function.

72
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,750
B is a little more complicated, but it
is still just a set of things we know.

73
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,540
Okay?

74
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,018
So, if you tell me some point and
you tell me the focal point,

75
00:03:29,018 --> 00:03:31,625
I can tell you this A matrix and
this B matrix.

76
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:36,875
I might not know T and omega, I might
want to solve for T and omega, okay?

77
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,830
But A and B I know everything of.
