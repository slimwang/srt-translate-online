00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,770
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,070
Megan's laughing already,
because you could tell it's Friday.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,029
Today, we're going to start on just
a couple of lectures that are,

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,010
could be labeled other
stuff you should know.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,230
It's just things that come along in
Computer Vision that are, are relevant.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,260
Some of them are very old,
some of them are new.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,320
Some of them seem trivial so
we don't even teach about them normally.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,910
And yet if you don't know about them,

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,100
you're totally mystified when
somebody talks to you about them.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,260
And what we're going to talk about
today is a little bit about color.

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,940
Now, I had to wrestle a little bit with
exactly how to do this because my own

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,480
background color really came
through psychophysics psychologies.

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,040
My, my degree was in brain and
cognitive sciences.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,260
So and I think of color as a
psychophysical or perceptual phenomena.

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,680
That is when you see this thing and
you say, oh, that's a light blue shirt.

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,730
That's actually not a physics statement,
it's a psychophysics statement.

17
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,550
So I'm actually going to start there.

18
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,860
We're going to talk about just a little
bit about, actually an, anatomy.

19
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,810
And then we'll move on to a little
bit of computational elements having

20
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,269
to do with color.

21
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,580
So and also in a few more lessons,

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,423
you're going to see some, just a few
of these slides and discussions again,

23
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:14,690
because we're going to talk
about the humans vision system.

24
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,080
But I need to just talk about
a little bit of it now, and

25
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,920
in particular,
I have to talk about your retina.

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,790
Well, and my retina,
and everybody's retina.
