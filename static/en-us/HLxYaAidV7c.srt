00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,798
The simplest test of genes in the environment is when we compare two sets of

2
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:09,370
identical twins. Those who are reared apart, and those who are reared together.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:14,130
Because they're genetically identical, if genes played no role in personality,

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,540
then we'd see a very small correlation or similarity between twins who were

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:25,720
reared apart, so different environments. Likewise, if environment played no

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,780
role, we would see the same correlations between twins that were raised

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:34,490
together and those who were raised apart, regardless of where they were raised.

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,900
When researchers collected data on personality of relatives including identical

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,869
twins, they found evidence for about 50% of the differences in personality

10
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:49,228
stemming from genetic influence. So, about half of our personality differences

11
00:00:49,228 --> 00:00:53,806
are due to our genetic make up. So, you would think that the other half stems

12
00:00:53,806 --> 00:00:58,760
from the environment. And that's essentially true. But, it's not that simple.

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,680
We can look at environment in two ways. One that we share with our family and

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,287
one that we do not share with our family. So, friends, teachers, role models,

15
00:01:09,287 --> 00:01:10,260
and more.
