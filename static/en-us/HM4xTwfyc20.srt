1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,941
Recall, one basic premise
we started this class off.

2
00:00:03,941 --> 00:00:08,028
And that is photography is
about capturing rays of light.

3
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:12,399
We came up with this whole pipeline that
we want to capture a 3D scene that's

4
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:13,299
illuminated.

5
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:18,523
We want to use optic, sensor, processing
and display to generate an image.

6
00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:23,387
But one thing we actually also looked
at was while the rays of light were

7
00:00:23,387 --> 00:00:26,684
the most important
primitive in the 3D scene,

8
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:31,622
we basically took that whole pipeline
to give us pixels at the end.

9
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:35,379
In essence, that was the goal
of the part of the pipeline.

10
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:40,186
So, in essence to us an image
of a scene was nothing else,

11
00:00:40,186 --> 00:00:42,299
but 2D array of pixels.

12
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,483
While we did actually believe that rays
of light are the fundamental primitives

13
00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:47,988
that we'd like to capture.

14
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:52,468
Most of the illumination in a scene
is actually rays of light that follow

15
00:00:52,468 --> 00:00:56,138
a straight path most of the time
from the scene to a sensor.

16
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:58,392
We have looked at a variety of ways,

17
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:02,076
where we have actually taken
rays of light through a lens or

18
00:01:02,076 --> 00:01:07,600
even a pinhole camera and put it on
a sensor where the image is formed.

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,723
And we argued that
computational photography,

20
00:01:10,723 --> 00:01:14,082
basically controls the various
set of parameters.

21
00:01:14,082 --> 00:01:17,336
And the optic sensor and illumination
and that's how computational

22
00:01:17,336 --> 00:01:21,330
photography is now impacting
the whole discipline of photography.

23
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,178
So the question I have really
in this lecture is, are pixels,

24
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:30,850
you know, are rather limiting
form of what we can capture.

25
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,797
So, in essence, we are doing a whole
lot of this and ending up at pixels.

26
00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:38,211
Is that a limitation?

27
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:42,274
Can we do something not to be just
stuck with pixels at the end?

28
00:01:42,274 --> 00:01:45,827
Can we do something that will let
us capture more of the environment?

29
00:01:45,827 --> 00:01:47,227
So then, for example,

30
00:01:47,227 --> 00:01:50,657
we can do something at the end
to generate the right image.

31
00:01:50,657 --> 00:01:55,138
So this whole pipeline, of course, we do
a lot of processing after we get pixels.

32
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:59,176
Can we do something by capturing
something a little earlier that would

33
00:01:59,176 --> 00:02:03,428
let us actually generate the pixels at
the end, like the way we want them.

34
00:02:03,428 --> 00:02:05,470
We saw various examples of this already.

35
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,506
Now we're going to actually kind of come
up with a formulation that will let us

36
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:12,721
understand the both the parameters
of how this can be done and

37
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:14,760
what are the variabilities faulted.
