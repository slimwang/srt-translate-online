1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
Let's look at this concept of the frequency domain of

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,930
a signal in a different way.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,100
Let's create this three-dimensional axis.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,490
A is amplitude, t is time.

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,740
This is exactly how we've been looking at signals.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,350
But, now, actually, let's look at also the third dimension here,

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,420
which relates these things, but now we're measuring the frequency.

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:23,100
So the first one, f1, we looked at, was basically our first frequency, right?

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,110
Which basically had this amplitude and

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,245
this variations for, again, a period of 4.

11
00:00:27,245 --> 00:00:31,450
f2 basically is, again, A and t are the same,

12
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:37,190
but what we did was we basically added and multiplied the frequency by twice,

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,300
to be able to have the same, twice the number of cycles in the same period.

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,670
So f2 was basically a step up in the frequency domain, here.

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,610
And similarly, f3 was another step in the frequency domain.

16
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,550
If we were to look at the same plot in a and

17
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,880
T, of course, it went from here to there to this.

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,820
This is how we actually looked at all of those four different, f1, f2,

19
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,880
f3 and f4, in the previous slides.

20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,170
So in essence, what we're trying to do is now look at the signal in these two

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,500
axes, amplitude versus frequency, not just amplitude and time.

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,690
In amplitude versus frequency, we have three different plots here,

23
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,530
of course we want to look at it from this direction.

24
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,570
For, in the time domain, we have been looking at it in this direction, and

25
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,920
we have seen these plots before.

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,330
But now we want to be able to look at these things from that side in this axis.

27
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,630
So one big question is,

28
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,180
how many samples do we want in different frequency domains?

29
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,890
Here we just showed three.

30
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,980
As I showed you before, if you went from N equals to 3 to N equals to 10 to

31
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:41,150
N equals to 50, we were actually much closer to the final signal that we wanted.

32
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,340
And of course, as N grew larger, we were even much closer.

33
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,580
So, of course, one big question remains is,

34
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,780
how many samples do we want of different frequencies?

35
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,850
Another part of it is, in the frequency domain, as we go down this axis,

36
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,210
what each and every one of the signals contributes to the overall signal, and

37
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,920
how we can control it.

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,990
And finally, the most important part,

39
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,080
why we want to do this kind of analysis in the frequency domain is, for

40
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,400
example here, if I'm looking at f1, I'm only looking at a very coarse signal.

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,062
When I'm looking at f3,

42
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:16,010
I'm looking at A comparatively from f1 a more finer signal.

43
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,470
So if you go down this axis where N is increasing, we basically,

44
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,220
here we're going to be looking at a very coarse signal.

45
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,910
And here we're going to be looking at a very fine signal.

46
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,958
So if you notice, one important part of it is, now we can do

47
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,957
analysis differently for coarse signal and differently for fine signals.

48
00:02:35,957 --> 00:02:37,594
And that's an important part of what we want to do,
