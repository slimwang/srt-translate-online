1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,690
So look at this framework here.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,350
Again, what we're interested
in is simple translation.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,340
Have an image.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,650
This image, in this case, has been
translated by certain tx and ty.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,200
Question for you to think about is,

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,070
how many points do I need to have to be
able to now model this transformation?

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,656
So please put in,
how many points correspondences we need?

8
00:00:20,656 --> 00:00:22,960
So in the previous case
I showed you before,

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,210
do we need all four of them here?

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,470
That's one question.

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,863
And also, how does, how many degrees
of freedom can be used to model this?

12
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,380
Please fill out these boxes.

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,820
And then, in this matrix,

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,440
tell me which parts of this three
by three matrix do we think that

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,280
the values would have to be, related to
the parameters that we need to change.

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,280
Just for simplicity sake, know that
we already know this will be one.

17
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,940
So, fill out the others, please.
