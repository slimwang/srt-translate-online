00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,323
If x-bar increases, then the difference between x-bar and mu 0 becomes larger.

2
00:00:05,323 --> 00:00:10,106
And therefore the t statistic becomes larger. That means the t statistic will

3
00:00:10,106 --> 00:00:15,280
be out here more, to the right. And then that's evidence that the mean of the

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,985
population that x bar comes from is greater than this mean. If x bar decreases

5
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:25,340
goes the opposite way, then the distance between these will also increase but

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,984
in the opposite direction. x bar will then be less than this value whatever it

7
00:00:30,984 --> 00:00:36,203
is. That means the t statistic will be way out here in the left. And then

8
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:41,571
that's evidence that mu is less than mu 0. And finally the further the value of

9
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:48,690
x bar from mu 0 in either direction. The stronger the evidence that they're not

10
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,254
the same. So when we're comparing x bar to mu 0, we center the t distribution

11
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:59,690
at mu 0. And then we find where x bar lies on this distribution. The further

12
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,899
out x bar is, the more likely that it comes from a population that has a mean

13
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,573
significantly different than mu 0.
