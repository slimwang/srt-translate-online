1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,799
Okay, so now you've decided which
features to extract from each image, and

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,209
you've trained a classifier
using label data.

3
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:08,240
Great work.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,390
The next step is to implement a method
of searching for objects, in this case,

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,080
for vehicles in an image.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,239
So how are we going to do that, Drew?

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,725
>> Well, you've seen that
you can consider cutouts or

8
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:22,150
subregions of an image, and
run your classifier on each subregion

9
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:24,399
to see if it contains the object
you're trying to detect.

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,739
So what you'll do next is implement
a sliding window technique,

11
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:29,739
where you'll step across
an image in a grid pattern and

12
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:33,129
extract the same features you trained
your classifier on in each window.

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,940
You'll run your classifier to
give a prediction at each step.

14
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:36,619
And with any luck,

15
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,070
it will tell you which windows
in your image contains cars.
