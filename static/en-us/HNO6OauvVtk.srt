1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,120
Throughout this lesson, we're going to
be highlighting different rules and

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,350
conventions, inspired by hiring
managers in the research we've done.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,029
These are the rules and

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,620
conventions you should follow when
writing or editing your resume.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,610
Please be aware that not all of
those rules apply worldwide.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,540
Our research is mostly focused in
Northern America, and we know that

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,730
there are different conventions in other
regions, like Germany where I'm from.

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,340
In true Udacity fashion, you'll solidify
this knowledge with interactive

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,630
activities that will have you analyzing
and assessing yours and others' resumes.

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,270
To let you focus on the concepts
in that note-taking,

11
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,290
we've provided you with a checklist that
summarizes everything we'll be covering.

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,550
There's a link to the digital and
PDF version in the instructor notes.

13
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,390
The digital version links
back to videos in the class.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,200
Let's get started.
