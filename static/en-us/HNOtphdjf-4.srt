00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,880
The answer is these last two. We'll go through

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,900
these one by one. In the first case, the

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,640
owner of the file is another user, and I'm

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,710
not in the group either, so I fall into

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,020
the other category. The other category has read permissions,

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,220
so I can read the file, and the command

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,000
succeeds. Now let's see what happens when I try

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,400
to read dir/bar.txt. I am the owner of bar,

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,260
and the owner has read permissions, but to get

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,160
there I have to pass through the directory dir, and

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,760
since I don't have execute permissions on dir, this generates

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,420
an error. The same thing happens for touch. Writing to

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,200
the directory file is okay, but actually creating a

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,010
new file in the directory requires the ability to pass

15
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,460
through. It is interesting to note what would have happened

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,562
if I had reversed the permissions on dir. Then cat

17
00:00:50,562 --> 00:00:54,000
dir/bar.txt would have worked, since I just need to pass

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,190
through the directory. The touch command would not have worked

19
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,520
however, as I would need to add the new file

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,050
name to the directory, and I don't have write permissions.
