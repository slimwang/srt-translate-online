00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,780
It sounds like Walters wrists
are getting better and

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,540
adding users is a big turning point for
the app congratulations.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,128
Whoa Laila you look terribly tired.

4
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:15,760
Is everything okay,
when's the last time you slept?

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,820
>> Yeah it's been awhile.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,790
We do a lot more user data now but
I'm not sure it's anything to celebrate.

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,270
Still struggling with just
exactly how to implement sharing.

8
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,430
Walter asked for sorting data.

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,330
And, well, that's pretty easy to
filter and sort our shopping lists.

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,295
As it is it makes me think of bigger and
badder looming questions.

11
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:40,720
>> And what are those?

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,520
>> I'm just I'm terrified about
what happens when we start getting

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,060
thousands of users.

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,050
I know too many as it
isn't a problem right now.

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,840
Heck it's even hard to
get my roommates and

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,535
Nana to use the app
in its current state.

17
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:57,825
But the decisions they make about
data now will affect the future.

18
00:00:57,825 --> 00:01:02,027
Our current model we made was
somewhat randomly put together.

19
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:04,930
Without any rigorous
thinking about performance.

20
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:10,100
I'm not even sure what the best way to
dissociate users and shopping lists is.

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,076
>> Yeah I could see how
that could be stressful.

22
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:16,549
Why don't you walk me through the exact
kind of functionality you are working on

23
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:18,180
in and worried about.

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,657
>> [SOUND] Let me pull the wire frames.

25
00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:25,170
So we could have the settings activity
show different sorting options.

26
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,850
And then on the items page,

27
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,690
we could differentiate between the
bought items and the non bought items.

28
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,570
The bought items would
all be on the bottom and

29
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,690
crossed out instead
of mixed in randomly.

30
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,940
As for how the data of the firebase
database itself should be organized,

31
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,080
I just don't know.

32
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,530
Finally, I want to implement some
sort of sharing functionality.

33
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,760
Right now all the lists are world
viewable which doesn't make a lot of

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,600
sense when we get tons of users.

35
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,317
What I'd like to happen is
that the users can make lists.

36
00:01:53,317 --> 00:01:56,470
But they're private until
their shared with other users.

37
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,615
>> Do you know what the sharing
flow will look like???

38
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:02,975
>> So I was thinking something
like a user can add friends and

39
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:04,660
then once a friend is added.

40
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,120
They can click a little check mark box
to show whether the list is being shared

41
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,990
with that friend or not.

42
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,970
And I was thinking of trying
to filter to allow for

43
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,240
basic auto complete functionality.

44
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,380
>> Well the first part where
you sort of list sounds easy.

45
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,670
Firebase has some basic filtering and
sorting function I built into it.

46
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,290
So you shouldn't worry
too much about that.

47
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,748
>> [SOUND] So what do you think?

48
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:28,840
Can we tackle sorting?

49
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,980
I can make the UI screens.

50
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,550
>> You know what,
why don't you take it easy for a bit.

51
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,190
I'll chat with the developer
about sorting.
