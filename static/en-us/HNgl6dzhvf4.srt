00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's now look at the data set that relates age to wage--how much money you make.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Most of you out there are young, so your preference might be that the world pays

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
young people the best, but in many countries wage goes up with age

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
until perhaps you hit retirement age.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Which one is it? Let's plot the data.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Here is a very elaborate data set of people of certain ages and their wages that they receive.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I want you to make a scatter plot for this data.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You'll realize that the highest wage is $267,000, and I want you read off the scatter plot

9
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
what is the youngest age in this data set where this wage is being realized.
