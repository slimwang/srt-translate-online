1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
With this answer, the rate of change of the number of recovered persons would be negative,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
meaning that that number shrinks.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This cannot be true. That number has to grow, so we can rule out this answer.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This derivative of a number of persons with respect to time

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
has to be something about persons per days.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It cannot be days times persons, so this cannot be true.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The remaining two answers are correct in that respect.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This answer which need to unbound its exponential growth. This works like compound interest.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The rate of change is proportional to the current value. This cannot be true.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So we are left with this answer, which make sense.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
For instance, if we have twice the number of infectious persons, this rate would go up

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
by a factor of 2--twice as many persons will recover per day.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And imagine you have 5,000 infectious persons, then you get a recovery rate

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
of 5,000 persons/5 days, 1,000 persons per day that recover.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
These 5 days seem to be something like a typical duration for the disease.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is right answer.
