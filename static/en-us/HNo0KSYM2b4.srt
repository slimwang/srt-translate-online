1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,340
Now, if I was looking at the scatter file,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,290
I would say that the correlation between these two

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,624
variables is about zero. Now, the autograder would have

4
00:00:07,624 --> 00:00:10,917
accepted anything between negative 2 10ths and positive 2/10. We

5
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:14,780
just wanted something reasonable. Now, to actually calculate the

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,330
correlation, we'd run cor.test function on Mitchell Month in

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,680
Mitchell Temp. It turns out that the actual value

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,360
is 57000ths, seems like a pretty weak correlation to me.
