00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,970
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,130
Today finally, finally,
finally we get to finish up on tracking.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,820
We've discussed tracking a few ways
from the inference perspective

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,850
where we have a dynamics model, and you
know the whole bit now at this point.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,900
Where we predict forward the state,
we take a measurement, and

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,180
we do our correction.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,940
One was a Kalman filter where
essentially we have a specific

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,340
representation for our densities,
namely Gaussians and

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,680
all the world's a Gaussian.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,630
Then we discussed,
particle filters where

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,790
because we're using samples you can
have much more arbitrary densities.

12
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,020
You just have to have enough
particles to represent them.

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,000
And also you need a generalized
censor model which works well.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,370
For this last section just talk
about a couple more methods.

15
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,280
Just so
you should see that they're being done.

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,650
And then at the end, I'm going to
talk about some issues that show up

17
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,980
in tracking,
no matter how you're doing it.

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,120
And it's sort of outside of
the main tracking conversation and

19
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,550
yet, if you don't deal with
those issues, nothing works.
