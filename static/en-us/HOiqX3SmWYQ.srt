Next question comes from Thomas,

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and his question has to do with mistakes.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Basically, you never seem to make any--at least in the videos.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Maybe you can talk a little bit about your design process in coming up

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
with these lectures and how mistakes figure in there.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There is always a trade off of how many mistakes we want to leave in,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and believe me, I make lots of them.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And I make them at various points in time.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So as I'm first thinking up the questions we're going to do, I'm coding up answers.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And I make mistakes there in a couple of ways.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
One is, I just make errors.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I write something. It computes the wrong answer.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It generates an error.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I swapped the order of two arguments, or I pass the wrong thing in.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm making those mistakes all the time.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Those aren't very interesting ones, so I don't show them.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And then, when I'm recording the videos, I make mistakes there too.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And, sometimes errors have crept into the program

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
that I didn't notice when I was developing them.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I didn't write enough test cases, and then I have to decide what to do.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And mostly, those have ended up on the cutting room floor.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So, just as when you watch a movie or a TV show, you don't see most of the outtakes.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sometimes after the credits, they roll a few of the outtakes

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So believe me the errors are there, we're not just showing most of them.
