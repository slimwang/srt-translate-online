00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,170
Here's our third practice problems for rationalizing higher order denominators.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,454
Now careful here, we don't have a cube root anymore. We have a six root. So

3
00:00:08,454 --> 00:00:11,678
think about what factors you need to multiply by or what powers these would

4
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:16,583
become in order to rationalize your denominator. Good luck.
