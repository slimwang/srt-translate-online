00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,348
So, how does a neuron work? To answer that, we first need to know the different

2
00:00:03,348 --> 00:00:07,676
parts of the neuron, because each has a different function. Then, we can take a

3
00:00:07,676 --> 00:00:12,935
more detailed look at precisely how the neuron fires. Which is what we call an

4
00:00:12,935 --> 00:00:16,786
action potential. First, we have the cell body or the soma, it contains the

5
00:00:16,786 --> 00:00:20,934
nucleus and genetic information, along with components for the maintenance and

6
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:26,395
function of the neuron. These are the dendrites. They're finger-like branches

7
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:31,510
that project from the soma to connect to other neurons and receive messages.

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,780
Extending out from the soma, on the opposite side of the dendrites, is the

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:41,132
axon. The axon transmits electrical impulses towards adjacent neurons and

10
00:00:41,132 --> 00:00:45,688
stimulates the release of what we call neurotransmitters, we'll get to those in

11
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:51,518
a second. Some axons have a myelin sheath wrapped around them. The myelin

12
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:56,290
sheath insulates the axon and makes the nerve impulse more effective. At the

13
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:01,745
end of each axon are the axon terminals, and the terminal buttons. The terminal

14
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:07,510
buttons contain tiny vesicles or sacs that contain neurotransmitters. Now, I'm

15
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,560
going to zoom into these terminal buttons so we can get a closer look at the

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,639
neighboring neuron and how the two connect.
