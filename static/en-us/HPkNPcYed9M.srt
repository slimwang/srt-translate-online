1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This is the correct way to write this condition.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In Python and most other programming languages, or has a little precedence than and.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And if you write this without parenthesis, the effect of this is that, this will be implicitly prioritize as this,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
meaning that the condition that tag must be said applies only for single quotes

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
but not for double quotes which would always be stripped.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And this is the reason why double quotes are stripped whereas single quotes are not stripped.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, they are stripped but only when we are in tag mode

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and when we are in tag mode, then the characters wont appear anyway.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We can apply this very same fix in our program simply by putting parenthesis

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
around this junction in here such as this junction takes precedence over the conjunction.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's see whether our example with the double quotes now works. Yes it does.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Now, we actually get the quotes properly in here. Let's try it a few more.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So let's see whether the single quotes still work too and while we read it

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
we can even add a few more to that--let's see what the output will be.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
First example, with double quotes are still there, not stripped.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Second example, single quotes, not stripped.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Third example, just the HTML markup, HTML markup is stripped.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Next one, quotes around HTML markup, quotes remained, HTML markup stripped.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So HTML markup is removed in all cases.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
How about our almost complex example, we have the reference with quotes within the tag.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Are they still properly stripped? We try this out. Yes, everything is properly stripped.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Quotes and greater than signs are handled just as they should be.
