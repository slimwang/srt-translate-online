00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,812
You now know about the fundamentals of interactive rendering. We've covered a

2
00:00:03,812 --> 00:00:08,116
lot ground. The basics of lighting and cameras, pipelines and bottlenecks,

3
00:00:08,116 --> 00:00:12,130
pixels and the z-buffer. I'd estimate you now know more that 99.44% of the

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,405
population, about what make interactive rendering tick. In the lessons ahead,

5
00:00:16,405 --> 00:00:20,092
we'll learn more about these subjects and related fields. You'll also begin to

00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:23,676
program and create virtual world to yourself as we delve further into the key

7
00:00:23,676 --> 00:00:25,503
elements of interactive 3D graphics.
