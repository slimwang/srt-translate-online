00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,426
One of the most famous trends is probably one

2
00:00:02,426 --> 00:00:05,610
you have heard of, it's Moore's Law. Moore's Law

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,720
roughly states that every one and a half to

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,750
two years, we will fit twice the number of

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,580
transistors on the same chip area. So this is

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,276
what technology improvement promises to do. As computer architects,

7
00:00:19,276 --> 00:00:22,488
we try to translate that into doubling the processor

8
00:00:22,488 --> 00:00:25,378
speed every 18 to 24 months. So what we

9
00:00:25,378 --> 00:00:27,338
try to do is, if the technology can give us

10
00:00:27,338 --> 00:00:30,026
twice as many transistors, we try to translate that into

11
00:00:30,026 --> 00:00:33,150
doubling the processor speed. We also try to reduce the

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,650
energy per operation to about half it was every 18

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,880
to 24 months. Pretty much. The transistors are now half

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,060
the sizes they used to be, so we try to

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,220
translate that into using half as much energy for the

16
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,526
operation of the same work. And we try to double

17
00:00:50,526 --> 00:00:53,810
the memory capacity every 18 to 24 months.

18
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,794
So we can fit twice as many transistors

19
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:57,960
on the same chip area. We tried to

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,540
translate that into having twice as much memory, if

21
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,805
this is a memory chip. Again note that,

22
00:01:04,805 --> 00:01:08,153
this is what the technology can be expected

23
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:10,943
to do and this is what architects are

24
00:01:10,943 --> 00:01:15,610
expected to do with that technology. That way we

25
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,920
can plan for what the technology will be able to provide us with, and we

26
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,320
know what the computer market will expect from our future computers.
