1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
And the correct answer here is that the running time of Bob's algorithm is 2^n * n²,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,250
which is just the same running time as the algorithm that Alice was using,

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,620
and the reasons are also very similar.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:20,350
If you have n genes, then again there's 2^n assignments of 0 and 1 to the genes,

5
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:27,570
and checking if an assignment is valid, so checking if all genes that have a 1 are connected

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,670
will also take O(n²*).

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,870
That, of course, depends a bit on how many 1's there are in the assignment,

8
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:41,050
but a worst-case analysis would be here that close to n genes have been assigned 1,

9
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,500
so we need to check all of their connections which similar to Alice's algorithm,

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,820
you already know there are about n² many of them.

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,430
Bob, similar to Alice, has so far only found an algorithm that is totally impractical

12
00:00:54,430 --> 99:59:59,999
for the problem that he's trying to solve because it has exponential running time.
