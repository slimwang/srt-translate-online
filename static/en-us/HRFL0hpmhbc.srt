00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,260
When we're all done forming the HTTP
request, we tell the Android system to

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,480
package and send out the request
over the Internet to the server,

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,800
which is step two of the process.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,900
In the Soonami app,

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,780
what line of code actually
establishes the HTTP connection?

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,610
Copy and
paste the line of code right here.

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,840
Once we have the connection, you'll see
that we can read information from it or

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,940
write new information to send to
the server over that same connection.
