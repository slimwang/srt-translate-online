00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,580
Let's analyze some of the benefits
of coded aperture here.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,970
Basically, we looked at
variety of different you know,

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,630
types of kernels here, larger scale,
correct scale, and a smaller scale.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,670
And, of course, we have the coded
apertures, of course, also scaled down.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,001
If you had an image like this to be
reconstructed on a conventional the,

6
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:21,724
again, Lucy Richardson types
of deconvolution method,

7
00:00:21,724 --> 00:00:23,072
you'd get a lot of ringing.

8
00:00:23,072 --> 00:00:26,200
Of course, if we do it at the correct
scale so the size of the kernel matches

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,230
the kind of signal that's in the
original image, you'll do much better.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,760
But of course,
if you do it a smaller scale,

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,340
you actually will add
other forms of blur.

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,110
Of course,

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,510
the secret is to figure out which of
these scales to do this kind of stuff.

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,890
We've looked at that concept, and

15
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,015
we looked all the frequency,
domain, fading, and blending stuff.

16
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:45,290
But in case of coded,
of course we have an artifact

17
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,810
that we might actually generate
something like this, but

18
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:53,050
we actually do get a much better
image at the right scale.

19
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,670
And of course,
a little bit of blurriness and

20
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,450
ringing at the scale that's smaller.

21
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,830
I do loo, encourage you to look at the
Levinthal paper, that'll gives you more

22
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,569
detail about this kind of stuff and
how to choose the right scale.
