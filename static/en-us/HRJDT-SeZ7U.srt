00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,900
All right, welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,870
Last time, or whenever it is you chose to watch.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,820
The last thing I talked to you guys about was how surface appearance involve

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,140
the interaction between the lighting and the surface itself and the shape.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,920
So that's what it says here that the image intensity that we'll see will be

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,290
a function of the lighting or the illumination, the surface reflectance, and

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,580
then when we say the shape what we actually mean is sort of the surface normals.

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,130
That is, how the shape is how the surface bends depending upon its

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,190
direction with respect to the illumination.

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,450
And so one of the challenges that this poses is, if you wanted to recover

11
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,620
say one of these, like you wanted to recover the shape or you wanted to recover

12
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,130
the reflectance of what's there, you know the texture or how bright it is.

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,850
In some sense you can't do one without knowing the other.

14
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,630
And this is a classic example of what's referred to as an ill posed problem in

15
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,860
computer vision.

16
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,560
That in some sense you cant do it without making some sort of an assumption.

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,960
And a simple example can be seen here.

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,744
All right, so what do you see here?

19
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:10,490
What you see is an image stolen from the web.

20
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,160
But probably what you're probably seeing, is you see some sort of matte,

21
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,930
or, light-textured sphere, with a light shining,

22
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,240
probably from say this direction here.

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,090
You might even see this is just a little ridged in it there, and

24
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,730
then the light falls off and then there's a shadow-cast here.

25
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,780
Is that what you see?

26
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,280
>> Yes.

27
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,350
>> But actually, what's really there, of course, is this very flat monitor

28
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,710
with different pixels that are sort of violating the whole illumination thing.

29
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,870
Because they actually emit light themselves,

30
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,320
which violates the entire principle of what we were saying before.

31
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,080
And, in fact, your stereo, right?

32
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,470
My two eyes are looking at this thing and saying, this thing is totally flat.

33
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,380
And yet, my brain says okay, yeah, there's this nice rounded thing there.
