1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,620
Now that we our animation all set up and

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,520
hooked up in code,
we tie some sound to the experience.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,790
For that, we need an audio clip.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,350
Unity supports a variety
of sound formats.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,756
And once we drag that audio
file into our project,

6
00:00:14,756 --> 00:00:17,347
Unity automatically converts
it into an audio clip.

7
00:00:17,347 --> 00:00:21,853
For this video,
we'll be using waves.wav.

8
00:00:21,853 --> 00:00:24,354
In order to place that
audio clip into our scene,

9
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:26,680
we need to create an audio
source component.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,167
Once we do that,

11
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:33,330
all we have to do is is drag our waves
clip onto the audio clip property.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,380
Of all the components in Unity,

13
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,350
the audio source has a lot of
different properties that we can

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,030
play around with in order to
tweak how an audio clip sounds.

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,720
There's some really simple effects
like volume, pitch, and loop but

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,110
we also have some more complex
effects like bypass effects,

17
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,800
audio mixer groups, and reverb zones.

18
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,180
For VR, one of the most important
effects is spatial blend.

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,980
This dictates whether
the position of our audio and

20
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,620
the scene affects how we hear it.

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,850
Some sounds, like background music,
will want to be heard from any location,

22
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,340
in which case,
we use a 2D spatial blend.

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,160
Other effects, like an animal chirp
will sound much better if they come from

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,850
their own location,
in which case we'd use a 3D blend.

25
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,460
In VR, the spatial blend of our
audio gives us clues as to what

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,410
action is happening around us,
especially when we can't see it.

27
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,290
And at this point you might be asking,

28
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,990
how does Unity know how far
an audio source is from our camera?

29
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,531
And, to answer that,
if we look at our main camera,

30
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:38,690
we'll see an audio listener component.

31
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,420
In our scenes, we're only allowed
to have one audio listener, and

32
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,947
this acts as the position for
calculating all spatial audio.

33
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:51,030
Luckily, we get that by
default on all our cameras.

34
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,479
But if you ever notice
you don't hear any audio,

35
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:56,600
make sure to check that you have
this audio listener enabled.

36
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,851
Since we're using a background noise for
our waves,

37
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:03,333
we can keep our spatial blend for
the audio stores at 2D.

38
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:07,387
And if we hit play now, we can hear our
ocean in the background of our scene.

39
00:02:07,387 --> 00:02:11,224
