00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,104
Let's say that we want to solve the equation x squared plus 8 x plus 15 equals

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:08,232
3. Well, we have two options. Our first option is to solve this graphically by

3
00:00:08,232 --> 00:00:12,487
plotting the intersection of two different curves. And our second option is to

4
00:00:12,487 --> 00:00:16,946
solve this purely algebraically. Let's start out with the first option. So, what

5
00:00:16,946 --> 00:00:21,490
two lines should be graph in order to solve this equation graphically? What two

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,105
lines do we want to intersect?
