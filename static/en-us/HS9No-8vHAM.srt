1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,340
For getting a list of movies by genre,
we use the /genre/(id)/movies method.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,100
And as the documentation indicates,
only movies with ten or more votes, or

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,180
ratings, are included.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,092
Then, to get a list of
a user's favorite movies,

5
00:00:13,092 --> 00:00:16,640
the /account/(id)/favorite/movies
method should be used.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,280
There's also a fun method called
/account/(id)/rated/movies, and

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,970
this returns a list of
the movies that users rated and

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,290
the movie's associated ratings.

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,060
To add or remove favorites, we'll use
the /account/(id)/favorite method.

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,580
This method is different than all
the methods we've seen before and

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,550
it uses the HTTP POST method.

12
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,110
It'll let us post data and
close in our request.

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,670
In this case, it'll be whether or

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,680
not this movie should be
added to our favorites list.
