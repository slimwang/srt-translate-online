Here's a story about
a company with a problem.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,110
Noodle Search runs the world's
best site for finding pasta.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,880
Management rewards the developers for

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,760
shipping new features,
like gluten free rice Noodle search.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,500
So the developers want the operations
team to push out new releases as quickly

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,550
as possible.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,550
But sometimes when releases go out,
the production systems slow down.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,550
Then the users start complaining to
tech support that they can't find their

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,890
linguine in a timely fashion, and half
their wonton queries are timing out.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,710
Then operations goes and
installs additional servers and

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,850
everything gets better,
until the next release.

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,900
What are the causes of this problem?

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,485
Is it that the development
environment doesn't match production?

14
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:42,815
That new releases aren't
being tested for performance?

15
00:00:42,815 --> 00:00:46,075
That operations should
automate the release process?

16
00:00:46,075 --> 00:00:49,372
That the business isn't
anticipating its scaling needs?

17
00:00:49,372 --> 00:00:52,668
Or that developers are being too
harsh to the operations staff?

18
00:00:52,668 --> 00:00:55,140
Mark which ever of these
that you think apply.
