1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,270
As we discussed,
macro virus is embedded in a document.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,120
So it's not really at
the operating system level.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,190
Boot sector virus, as we discussed,

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,620
boot sector virus resides in
the boot sector of the hard drive.

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,660
And it runs before
the operating system is loaded.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,900
So it's not really at
the operating system level.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,020
Memory-resident virus, as we discussed
it is embedded in the operating system,

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,140
so that whenever a system runs,
the virus stays in the memory and

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,198
it can infect any running program.

10
00:00:29,198 --> 00:00:33,130
So therefore, memory-resident
virus begins at the OS level.
