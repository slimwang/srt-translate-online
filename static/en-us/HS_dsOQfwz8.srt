00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,210
A small multiple, sometimes known as a trellis or

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,860
a lattice plot is a series of charts laid out in a grid.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,680
They often represent common data faceted by different categories.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,090
In this case we have engineering,

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:19,580
operations, accounting, HR, IT, and manufacturing.

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,940
On the X axis we have different months of the year.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,960
And on the Y axis we have different salary expenses for each department.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,960
I really love small multiple plots because you can embed any type of chart and

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,080
they generalize to any type of comparison.

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,140
Here we've embedded line plots to show how

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,520
salary expenses vary over months of the year for each department.

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,430
But we could have just as easily embedded different histograms, maps, or

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,920
even pie charts.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,450
The small multiple was popularized in coin by Edward Tufte,

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,470
a leader in the field of data visualization.

16
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,900
We'll learn more about him later in the lesson.

17
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,930
And we'll hear about him throughout the course.

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,970
Box plots are another technique to visualize multiple distributions in

19
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:08,850
one graphic.

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,560
Just like a small multiple, a series of box plots allow us to

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,760
visualize different distributions all in one graphic.

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,690
The box plot was invented by John Tukey and

23
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,670
comes from the field of exploratory data analysis.

24
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,180
While small multiple and box plots are often used for

25
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,390
exploratory data analysis to learn how your data's distributed.

26
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,430
They can also be used to convey certain points and

27
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,860
relationships between your data and your variables.

28
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,640
For example, in the box plot here, we have a series of experiments, one,

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,930
two, three, four, and five, measuring the speed of light.

30
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,360
And for each experiment we take a series of measurements that are visualized as

31
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,070
a single box plot.

32
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,550
Here we can see the quartile ranges, and the mean.

33
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:59,290
And we can plot these side by side to see what we likely believe the speed of

34
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,570
light to be after a series of experiments.

35
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,780
We can see here, the true speed of light is actually plotted in the red line,

36
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,150
and is quite a bit lower than all the experiments shown here.

37
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:15,020
Just one last point on the difference between EDA and data visualization,

38
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,230
typically in EDA you're trying to discover some information about your data for

39
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,580
yourself, whereas with a data visualization you're trying to

40
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,700
communicate some information about your data to others.

41
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,240
Depending upon your intention, you can use both box plots and small multiples to

42
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,910
either learn more about your data or try to convey something to others
