00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,490
For this programming assignment, you needed to have rearranged the

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,890
levels of the age.range variable, so that way, under 18 appeared

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,830
first. One way to do this is to use the ordered

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,430
function on the variable. We'll use the ordered function on age.range,

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,800
and then we'll set the levels. I can run all

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,320
this code to set the levels, and then, I can make

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,140
my plot again. Pretty nice, huh? Another way to achieve the

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,120
same result would be to use this code. Here, we're using

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,310
the factor function. We're taking our age.range variable,

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,710
setting the levels, and then making the order

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,470
be true since we want these ordered. I'll

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,700
run this code. And then, I'll make sure that

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,150
the graph is the same output. And yes,

14
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,830
it is. Now, if you want another challenge, try

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,260
reordering the levels for the income range variable,

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,040
and see if you can produce this same plot.
