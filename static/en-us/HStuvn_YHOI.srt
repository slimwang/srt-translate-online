Here's the perspective projection matrix. I hate it when objects get clipped by

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,563
the near plane. What happens if I set the near distance to zero? The

3
00:00:07,563 --> 00:00:11,968
homogeneous coordinates cannot be turned into NDCs. All the resulting NDC Z

4
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:16,893
values are zero. The X and Y values become mirrored, i.e, negated. The

5
00:00:16,893 --> 00:00:19,530
resulting NDC Z values are almost all one.
