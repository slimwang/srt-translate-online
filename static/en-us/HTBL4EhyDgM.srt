00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,940
So, let's see if we understood
the relationship between refreshes and

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,130
reads.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:12,360
Suppose we have a memory array that
has 4,096 rows and 2,048 columns and

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,940
suppose that the refresh period for
this array is 500 micro-second.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,250
Every cell needs to be refreshed within
this time, otherwise it will lose data.

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,190
Now suppose that the timing for
reads for this memory is as follows.

7
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,820
It takes us four nanoseconds
to select a row.

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,730
Once we activate the row,
ten nanoseconds are needed for

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,392
the sense amplifier to get
the bit values from that row.

10
00:00:38,392 --> 00:00:43,497
Two nanoseconds are needed to put
that data in the row buffer and

11
00:00:43,497 --> 00:00:47,870
four nanoseconds are needed for
the column decoder

12
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,110
to actually figure out which bit
from the row buffer we need.

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,030
While this is happening, we are writing
the data back from the sense

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,540
amplifier to the memory row, and
it takes us 11 nanoseconds to do that.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,450
So this part overlaps with these two.

16
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,000
So the question for
you is how many data, or

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,090
nonrefresh reads per second
can this memory support?

18
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,100
Put your answer here.
