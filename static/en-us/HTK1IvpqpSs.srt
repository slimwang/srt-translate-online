1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,830
So there are lots of different ways to answer this,

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,440
especially, depending on your age. Here's one way. So, I'm going to

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,130
define the variable, age, and I'm going to use my age in

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,340
spirit, which is 7. And then, we'll multiply that by the

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,960
number of days in a year. But let's also define

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,960
a variable for the number of days in a year. And

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,510
we could use 365. If we want to account for leap years,

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,360
it would be more accurate to use 365 and a quarter,

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,480
since one quarter of the years are leap years.

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,460
And to compute the number of days that I've been

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,360
alive, we can multiply those two values and print

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,540
out the result. So let's try that in the Python

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,600
interpreter. So here, we've defined our two variables. We

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,890
have age is 7, not my real age, in case

15
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,100
you're wondering. And days_in_year is 365 and a quarter.

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,430
So we'll multiply those two to print out the result,

17
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,160
which is 2556 and 3 quarter days. Quest to do

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,990
this more accurately, we'd need to use a real age.

19
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,220
And our actual age is probably not an exact number

20
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,490
of years, unless it's your birthday today, in which case,

21
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,140
happy birthday. But otherwise, you'd need to add the number

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,330
of days since your birthday to get a more accurate

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,210
number. I'll change my age to my real age. And

24
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,750
I will add the number of days since my birthday.

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,090
Which is 268, if you're watching this on the day it's

26
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,540
released. And then we got my age, in days, is 14,878. Which

27
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,970
seems pretty old.
