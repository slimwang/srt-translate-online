1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I need one or more leading digits, and then there's a sort of

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
a compound optional part, so I'll use parenthesis.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We may have a dot and to really mean the dot,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm going to use the backslash to escape the dot because remember

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
it has a special meaning in regular expressions, any character.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And then I can have zero or more digits afterwards.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And then that whole grouping is optional.
