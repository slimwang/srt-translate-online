00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,620
So what is a 3D scene made of, anyway?

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,590
Our apartment is going to have chairs,
tables, books, and

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,080
stuff like that, but
what are those items made of?

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,850
It turns out that basically everything
in a 3D scene is made of points and

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,160
those points are joined
together to form triangles.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,920
And those triangles are joined
together to form meshes.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,830
And those meshes are the foundation for

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,620
virtually everything you
see in virtual reality.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,340
Now the meshes go through a bunch
of steps before appearing as pixels

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,730
on your VR headset screen.

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,350
But everything starts out as
simple triangles made of points.
