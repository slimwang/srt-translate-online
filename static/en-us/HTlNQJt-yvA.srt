00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,027
So, you could either choose to subtract the c or divide by a first. It doesn't

2
00:00:04,027 --> 00:00:07,556
matter which order you do these in, as long as you obey all the proper

3
00:00:07,556 --> 00:00:11,615
mathematical rules. In particular, when we divide both sides by a, make sure

4
00:00:11,615 --> 00:00:15,617
that you divide every term on each side by a, and do that division correctly.

5
00:00:15,617 --> 00:00:20,103
The first time I did this, I actually messed up dealing with the second term in

6
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:24,656
the left-hand side. I didn't write a squared, I just didn't write an a at all in

7
00:00:24,656 --> 00:00:29,387
the denominator. So, everyone makes mistakes. It's not a big deal if you do. We

8
00:00:29,387 --> 00:00:34,261
just gotta keep learning from them. Anyway, the equation we end up with at the

9
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:38,973
end of this step is the quantity x plus b over 2a squared minus b squared over

10
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:41,360
4a squared equals negative c over a.
