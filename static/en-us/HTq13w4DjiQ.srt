00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,906
So far the process of completing this square looks pretty similar to what we did

2
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:07,775
before when the leading coefficient was 1. But here's where things are going to

3
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:11,675
get a little bit tricky, or at least a little bit different from what we've seen

4
00:00:11,675 --> 00:00:15,300
before. The next step that I'd like you to do is to factor out that leading

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,170
coefficient that we have on the right hand side. So pull out this 3 from these

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,397
two terms and then write what we need to multiply that by in this box. Think

7
00:00:23,397 --> 00:00:28,497
about why we want to do this based on the final form of the equation that we

8
00:00:28,497 --> 00:00:29,900
want to end up with.
