00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,556
Let's say we don't know how the song might impact engagement. It could make

2
00:00:03,556 --> 00:00:08,512
students less engaged, or make them more engaged. Therefor, we're going to put

3
00:00:08,512 --> 00:00:14,100
here, muse sub song. because the song is the intervention. We're going to try

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,160
to test if this parameter will be significantly different from what you've

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,795
already found. Our next step is to set a criteria for making a decision. Where

6
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:26,956
our decision will be to either reject or fail to reject the noll. We have to

7
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:33,358
choose our alpha level, the alpha level we'll generally use is .05, which means

8
00:00:33,358 --> 00:00:39,178
that for a two tailed test, we have 2.5% or .025 and a porportion of .025 on

9
00:00:39,178 --> 00:00:47,527
the left tail. Then we'll find the z-critical values. And finally, we'll find

10
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:51,640
the z-score of the sample mean, and see if it falls in the critical region.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,534
Based on that, we'll decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null

12
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:59,360
hypothesis. That's an overview of everything you were going to do in this

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,573
lesson. Before we get cracking, let's make sure you understand what it means to

14
00:01:03,573 --> 00:01:08,470
reject the null. Select the appropriate word in each sentence, so that they all

15
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,842
describe what it means to reject the null. One point of clarification, when

16
00:01:12,842 --> 00:01:17,470
figuring out this second one, just ignore negatives. Let's say the z-critical

17
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,130
value is positive, then how big should be the z-score of the sample mean to

18
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,279
reject the null?
