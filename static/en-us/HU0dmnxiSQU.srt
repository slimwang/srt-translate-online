1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,750
It's pretty simple to fix that linear solution that we did before.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,939
So do what we said before, solve for F.

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:12,510
And you can do SVD where that minimum eigenvector or you can

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,670
use the linear thing where you set it to 1, although I don't like that method.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,310
Okay, you solve for an F.

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,170
Then what you do is you decompose your F using SVD again.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,230
This is another SVD, another singular value decomposition.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,994
And you're going to get out three terms, all right.

9
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,405
Remember SVD gives you UVD transpose, V is the lower-dimensional orthogonal

10
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:37,780
matrix of all unit vectors that are orthogonal with each other.

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,130
U is also orthogonal but of the full dimension.

12
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,000
Now, what did D stand for?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,150
No, not dalmatian, not dysfunctional, despite what you might think.

14
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,350
D stood for diagonal, okay?

15
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,560
So it breaks down, it gives you a diagonal matrix.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,820
Now if F is really a full ranked three by three matrix,

17
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,750
D is going to come out as a diagonal matrix with three non-zero elements.

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:10,200
And D, normal SVD, is produced in a decreasing magnitude, okay?

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,970
So it goes from largest to smallest.

20
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,250
So what we do is, we take the D that comes out,.

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,590
And I just wrote that as rst here, okay?

22
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,950
And t is smaller than s which is smaller than r.

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,750
And what we're going to do is we're going to create a new D, D hat.

24
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,700
And just set that less, that least value to 0.

25
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,780
Because it was supposed to be 0,

26
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,180
because that would be a rank 2 F would have a r, s, and 0.

27
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,940
So we make it 0, great.

28
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,860
Once we've done that we can build a new F,

29
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,010
which I'll call F hat, using the same U that we got the first time.

30
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,450
The same V that we got the first time, but

31
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,060
we substitute in this new D, right, D hat.

32
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,260
Which is the one that has only got two diagonal elements.

33
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,850
And that gives us a new fundamental matrix that has just rank 2.

34
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,050
When I apply that to the example that I showed you before,

35
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,660
you get epipolar lines that look like this.

36
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,080
Way, way better.

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,210
In fact, you can see here the camera was not moving perfectly straight.

38
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,010
It was moving off to the side just a little bit in that direction,

39
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,250
and here is the epipole, right?

40
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,000
All the epipolar lines go right through the epipole, so

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,940
we've got the good F, and all is happy in Oz.
