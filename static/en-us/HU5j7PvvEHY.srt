00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,050
For most of us, we tend to use odd sized sets of weights.

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,510
And what that lets me do is put my set of weights centered over the pixel that

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,670
I'm changing.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,020
All right? Otherwise, what I have to do is sort of put the center

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,770
between the set of weights and average them that way.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,740
And that what, and then, so we tend to use a odd but symmetric weight mask.
