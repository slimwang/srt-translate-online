1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,750
In this one we're talking about
a company, in particular payroll data,

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,580
who gets paid how much.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,870
And so we have a file that stores data
that is created by a user who works for

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,330
the payroll department.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,309
And obviously this user is
an employee of the company.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,050
But let's say it has
a compensation information.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,740
By the way, there is a large company
right next to the Georgia Tech

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,420
campus had a situation where
people's salaries were leaked.

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,850
And that happens when somebody shares
the information, either by mistake or

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,780
by design, with others of whom
this information should be shared.

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,980
So here we're talking
information of that kind.

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,880
Access to it has to be controlled.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,990
So what kind of policy is going to help
us provide the right kind of access

14
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,840
control for it.

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,150
There are two options.

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,820
It could either be DAC or
it has to be MAC.

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,890
So I want you to think about it and

18
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,460
then we'll discuss which
answer is the right one.
