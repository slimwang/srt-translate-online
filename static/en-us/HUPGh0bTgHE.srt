1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,070
So then, I guess you know, this, there is a bug there definitely.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,870
And then if next is equal to blank which is the character we want to

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:16,410
count the count is incremented using the plus, plus operator.

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,600
[COUGH] Then we read the next character again using the read.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,400
function, the read method on on the stream.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,560
And then it would print the character that we just read.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,710
>> Should we really be printing all these characters on a new line every time?

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,960
Or do we want the sentence to actually look like the characters are one

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,500
after another in a sentence?

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,660
>> You have to say that was not specified.

11
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,749
So I made that decision but.

12
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,700
It didn't sound like a very good decision.

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,354
I mean, you think you're going to have this, [LAUGH] this line of characters,

14
00:00:47,354 --> 00:00:52,227
vertical line of characters coming out that you, then it's difficult for

15
00:00:52,227 --> 00:00:56,224
you to check if the sentence that I put in, that was the sentence,

16
00:00:56,224 --> 00:01:00,848
try to figure out you know, if it actually caught them all and, and, and-

17
00:01:00,848 --> 00:01:03,484
[CROSSTALK].

18
00:01:03,484 --> 00:01:04,186
>> Kind of drives-

19
00:01:04,186 --> 00:01:04,976
>> Right now it's a vertical line of integers, it's not even characters.

20
00:01:04,976 --> 00:01:09,210
>> Yeah, that's true.

21
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:09,870
>> So, it's-

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,120
>> Even worse.

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,970
>> Right. >> Yeah, you're right, okay.

24
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,135
Okay, okay, that's fine.

25
00:01:13,135 --> 00:01:16,188
I didn't realize that, that was going to be printed as an integer.

26
00:01:16,188 --> 00:01:17,885
You're probably right.

27
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:20,856
And so it should be really printed as a character.

28
00:01:20,856 --> 00:01:23,704
[CROSSTALK].

29
00:01:23,704 --> 00:01:24,566
>> You didn't realize.

30
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:27,339
I mean, you never even ran your code once on your test.

31
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:32,028
>> I did run it I just, the input wasn't just that.

32
00:01:32,028 --> 00:01:34,520
>> It's like students who appear in science class.

33
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,660
It just compile it doesn't work.

34
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,978
>> I mean, this is one of the advantages of-

35
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:39,053
[CROSSTALK].

36
00:01:39,053 --> 00:01:42,750
[LAUGH].

37
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,050
>> This is actually, you know, one of the advantages of inspection.

38
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:51,810
I mean, this code, is could just, part of a larger piece of code and

39
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,835
so we're just reading it right now and didn't really.

40
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:55,380
[COUGH]. >> Go through a serious testing phase.

41
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,145
Yeah, I compiled. [COUGH].

42
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:57,590
>> To make sure there were no syntactic errors.

43
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,700
>> We can continue from here.

44
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,560
>> We can continue.

45
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,912
Thank you. [COUGH] Okay, so at this point-

46
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:03,450
>> We're going to get bite me to go see if he can compile it and

47
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,150
see if it even compiles.

48
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,100
I'm not even sure if it compiled yet.

49
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,508
>> Well, it may have of compiled.

50
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:10,229
I can't remember.

51
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,210
The last time I checked I know it didn't work.

52
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,430
It didn't give us what we wanted.

53
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,043
>> It does compile though.

54
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:15,729
I mean I'm positive about that.

55
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:16,270
>> Okay, okay.
