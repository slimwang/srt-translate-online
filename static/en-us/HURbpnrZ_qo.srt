1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answers are for this anchor the prefix has got to be one character--the A.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This anchor--we can't cover another anchor, so it's got to be zero.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This anchor--we conclude this if we want, but we can't go on to the other anchor, so it's zero to one.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Here we've got to include the D but nothing else, so it's 1.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now, there's one more thing about anchors I want to cover,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
which is how we deal with the words in the other direction.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
For these five anchors there are no letters in the other direction.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So these are completely unconstrained.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We say that any letter can go into those spots.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But in these two anchors, there's adjacent letters,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and it would be okay. We could form a word going in this direction.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But we can do that only if we can also form a word going in this direction.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's say there are no more. This is either the edge of the board or the next row is all blanks.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Then we can say, well, what letters can go here?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Only the letters that form a word when the first letter is that word and the second letter is U.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
In our dictionary, it turns out that that possibility is the set of letters M, N, and X.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
MU, NU, and XU are all words in our dictionary, believe it or not.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The Scrabble dictionaries are notorious for having two- and three-letter words

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
that you've never heard of.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Similarly here--what are two-letter words that end in Y?

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It' the set M, O, A, B. You've probably heard of most of those.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
When we go to place words on a particular row,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
we can pre-compute the crosswords and make that be part of the anchor.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What we're going to do is have a process that goes through, finds all the anchor points,

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and finds all the sets of letters--whether it's any letter for these five anchors,

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
or whether it's a constrained set of anchor letters for these two anchors.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Sounds complicated, but we can make it all work.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let me say that once you've got this concept, the concept of the anchor sets

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and the cross words, then basically we're done. We've done it all.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We can handle a complete board no matter how complicated, and we can get all the plays.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It's just a matter of implementing this idea and then just fleshing it out.
