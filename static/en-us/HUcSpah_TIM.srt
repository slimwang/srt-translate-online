00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,720
Before we start with the examples,

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:05,589
you should become familiar with
two cheatsheets I have for you,

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,169
the seven commandments of AutoLayout and
the guiding principles of AutoLayout.

4
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:13,890
Let's take a look at them.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:19,390
The guiding principles of AutoLayout
are generic rules about wisdom

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,560
related to AutoLayout.

7
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:25,239
So the first one is,
we always start with StackViews and

8
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:29,139
only use constraints if we cannot
solve the problem with StackViews.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,399
So StackViews first.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,940
Start small, or not at all.

11
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:40,799
What this means is you should choose
a small part of your UI and start

12
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,899
from there, not the other way around,
from the bigger picture to the details.

13
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,920
Start with the details.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,200
Work from the inside out.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,990
This is related to the previous one.

16
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,300
We're always going to start with
some inner small part of the UI and

17
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:58,379
then grow from there.

18
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,800
This is a very important one,
trust the simulator only.

19
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:07,531
Why, because even though Xcode or
Interface Builder will provide you

20
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:13,471
with a pretty decent preview of how
your UI will look, it still has bugs.

21
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:15,810
So it will not always work.

22
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,799
So if you are sure that
your layout is correct but

23
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,390
it's not showing the way it
should on the preview simulated,

24
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,780
tried it on the simulator or
on a device.

25
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,049
And the most important of all,
don't panic, okay?

26
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,759
So AutoLayout is complex, but
trust me, there is a logic to it,

27
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,880
a bizarre one, but there is a logic to
it and you will soon understand it.

28
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,049
So stick to the principles, the
commandments, and remember, don't panic.

29
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:54,390
Let's take a look at the seven
commandments of AutoLayout.

30
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,989
These are specific techniques that you
will apply in all of the examples and

31
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:03,069
in any usage of
AutoLayout in the future.

32
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:08,585
First thing you should do is tweak
the properties of the StackView.

33
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:13,570
If that doesn't fix it,
we're going to use another StackView.

34
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:16,989
Usually we'll put that first
StackView inside of another one.

35
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:22,900
Still in trouble, then we tweak
the compression resistance or

36
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,140
the hugging priority of
the views inside the StackView.

37
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:34,951
Only if we reach this point should we
add constraints, but to the StackView.

38
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:40,609
If it still doesn't work, then we add
constraints to the views themselves.

39
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,350
Still in trouble?

40
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,790
If you have to connect views that
are within different StackViews,

41
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:50,310
then you should use
the fifth commandment.

42
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,580
We'll see this in an example.

43
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:56,121
And if everything else fails,
then use a filler view.

44
00:02:56,121 --> 00:03:00,210
We will also see later what this means,
a filler view.

45
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,443
You're not expected to understand
all of this at this point.

46
00:03:03,443 --> 00:03:08,990
So don't worry, we'll go through all
of the commandments along the examples.

47
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:14,189
Although I highly suggest that you write
these down or even tattoo them somewhere

48
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:17,889
because you're going to use them very,
very often.

49
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:20,294
Anyway, enough talk,
let's fire up Xcode.
