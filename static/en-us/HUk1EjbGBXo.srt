00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,180
Let's build off this a little bit.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:08,890
Let's do that by taking all of these vertices that have k+1 edges or more and actually putting them

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:14,430
in the cover and that's because we already said it has to be in the cover.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,610
Now, what we can do is actually remove these vertices from the graph and any edges

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,420
connected to them because those edges are automatically covered

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,450
so we don't have to worry about them anymore.

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:31,250
We automatically are dealing with a much smaller graph or potentially much smaller graph.

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:37,530
What this tells us is that after removing these vertices, each remaining vertex can cover

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,780
at most a certain number of edges if it's put in a cover, and this could either be--

10
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,320
k-1, k, k+1, 2k, or k² edges.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,150
What this would then mean is that the remaining graph can't have no more than a

12
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:58,520
certain number of edges if G is a "Yes" instance of the vertex cover decision problem,

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:08,010
which is the original assumption that we made, and this can either be k-1, k, k+1, 2k, or k².

14
00:01:08,010 --> 99:59:59,999
So please check whichever is appropriate for both of these questions.
