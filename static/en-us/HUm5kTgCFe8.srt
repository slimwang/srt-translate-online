1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,500
Let's roll back time a little bit.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,150
Let's go back to where we had
$10,000 in our account and

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,970
we owed Joe 100 shares of stock.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,780
What can go wrong?

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,840
What if, instead of going down,

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,870
IBM went up to $150 per share, and
now you want to exit your position?

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,810
Well, again, you go to Lisa and
say, hey, Lisa,

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,950
do you want to sell me your shares?

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,180
She says no.

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,200
Well, Nate is still out there,
he's willing to sell.

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,658
So again, you buy those shares from
Nate then you return them to Joe.

12
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:40,120
But this time it costs you $15,000
because the price has gone up.

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,270
And remember,
you've got only $10,000 in your account.

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,784
So the net result after all this is
said and done is that you're out $5,000.

15
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:54,809
So if you bet wrong when you short
a stock and the price goes up,

16
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,689
you lose money, and
it can be significant.

17
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:59,720
So to recap,

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,489
we've gone through many of the different
aspects of the mechanics of the market.

19
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:09,270
We've shown you how hedge
funds exploit the market.

20
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,330
We've shown you different order types.

21
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,670
And we've shown you especially
the details of short selling.

22
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,590
I'll see you at the next lesson.
