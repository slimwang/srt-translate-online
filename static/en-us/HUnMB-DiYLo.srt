There are a few canned materials that 3JS provides. You can have a diffuse

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,586
surface, a glossy surface, and a reflective surface. You can make objects

3
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:13,590
transparent. You can even apply textures. In this unit we'll start by digging a

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,634
bit deeper into the graphics pipeline. One important element of the modern GPU

5
00:00:17,634 --> 00:00:20,514
is that significant parts of its pipeline can be programmed to do whatever we

6
00:00:20,514 --> 00:00:25,730
want. This is particularly compelling for displaying materials. You can use a

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,753
wide variety of equations to simulate how a surface looks. With this ability to

8
00:00:29,753 --> 00:00:32,987
fully control the illumination model, you can create a wider and wider range of

9
00:00:32,987 --> 00:00:37,118
substances as you learn more techniques. You can create objects that look

10
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:41,340
refractive like glass, or semitransparent and hollow. You can make objects that

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,925
have unusual optical properties. Once you get into illumination models and

12
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:49,971
shader programming the world takes on a slightly different look. I know myself

13
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:53,133
when I look at some unusual mineral or beautiful wood grain I think, hm, how

14
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:56,421
many shader instructions could I do that in?
