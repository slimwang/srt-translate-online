1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,230
We discussed the need for reducing
the size of the trusted computing base.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,220
If we do that, we have couple
of different options here,

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:12,250
so you should check each one that you
think smaller size TCB would help with.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,110
Okay?

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,520
So, for example, tier testing or

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,950
verification, if smaller size helps with
each of these, you check those options.
