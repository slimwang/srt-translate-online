1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,513
Now we've got everything we need to play basic sound effects with no unfly

2
00:00:05,513 --> 00:00:08,314
audio processing.

3
00:00:08,314 --> 00:00:08,755
[SOUND].

4
00:00:08,755 --> 00:00:12,103
The only thing we have left to do, is to adjust the volume of various effects

5
00:00:12,103 --> 00:00:17,923
based on where they happen in the game world. For example, when my character

6
00:00:17,923 --> 00:00:23,700
picks up quad damage, I hear it at full volume. [SOUND]. An explosion that

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,670
happens in the distance may only be heard at half volume. [SOUND]. And it won't

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,550
even hear an enemy who picks up an energy canister on the far edges of the map.

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,144
Now, Grits uses a pretty simple distance calculation based on the ViewRect

10
00:00:40,144 --> 00:00:46,414
side. We want to be able to hear the sound, within the screen radius at full

11
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:52,823
volume. Then, we'll want to scale down the volume to zero, as we reach two

12
00:00:52,823 --> 00:00:59,466
times the radius. Finally, you won't hear any sound at all outside of that

13
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:00,701
radius.
