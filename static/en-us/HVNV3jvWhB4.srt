1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,450
At this point, we've gone over
how to understand the market.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,900
We did this by creating
a market segmentation and

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,080
identifying our most valuable
customers to focus on.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,390
We learned how to position our
product to these customers and

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,905
how to, differentiate what we're
offering from our competitors.

6
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:19,955
And we were able to sum all of this up
in our value proposition statement.

7
00:00:19,955 --> 00:00:23,585
>> These skills help you to not only
prepare your marketing plan, but

8
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:25,915
more importantly understand your users.

9
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:28,515
Who are these users you want
to market your product to?

10
00:00:28,515 --> 00:00:30,575
Hopefully you have this picture by now.

11
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:32,795
Now, we're going to add
to what we've learned and

12
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:34,465
go over what to do before you launch.

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,750
With pre-launch we're going to
explore what it takes to prepare for

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,320
your launch in an efficient and
productive way.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,180
We're hoping to provide
you with a toolbox,

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,800
bunch of things you have to learn and
do before you launch your product.

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,620
This preparation will help you launch
more successfully and more effectively.

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,780
If you have a good app, and

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,950
I'm sure you do, you may be able to
create some buzz around your launch.

20
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,775
So, you want to make sure
your all prepared to it.

21
00:00:57,775 --> 00:01:00,880
>> In this lesson, we're going to go
through finalizing you marketing plan.

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,610
This is going to include what
we learned in the last lesson,

23
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,140
Understanding the Customer.

24
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,760
Along with your marketing goals,
your tracking and metrics setup, and

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,040
your distribution plan.

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,630
Then we're going to go through preparing
your materials that you're going to need

27
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,210
for launch.

28
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,440
So your landing pages, your app store
listing, and your beta testing groups.

29
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,290
>> So to be as effective
as possible with our plan,

30
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,800
let's first start with
setting your marketing goals.

31
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,010
And answer the question, what is
this that you're trying to achieve?
