00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So now that you have a large number of tools in your regular expression tool belt.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's put it together and build a new regular expression.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'd like you to submit via the interpreter.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Assign to the variable regexp, a Python regular expression that matches lowercase words--

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
letters (a - z) or singly-hypenated lowercase words.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let me show you what that means.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So we could have just a word like html or a hyphenated word like well-liked.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But we don't want doubly-hyphenated words like a-b-c or 2 hypens in a row,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
just these 2 options.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And it's worth noting that it may not be possible to get this perfect yet.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,717
Not all problems are solvable. Just do your best.
