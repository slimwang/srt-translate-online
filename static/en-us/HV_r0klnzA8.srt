1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And let's look at this--if x=0 then y=0. So he has to go through the origin.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's takes out the red hypothesis over here.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now if x=2, then y is 4. That means the line goes to the point 2, 4 and of course, 1, 2.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That makes the green line the correct choice here.
