00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,210
No, this is not necessarily true. Look at these 2 people. They slept different

2
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:12,128
amounts of sleep, 6 hours and 8 hours but got the same temporal memory score

3
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:13,037
about 70.

4
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:19,351
Remember our discussion of lurking variables or extraneous factors? We haven't

5
00:00:19,363 --> 00:00:24,624
taken all of these into account. In other words, we haven't controlled for

6
00:00:24,636 --> 00:00:30,134
lurking variables. Sleep could influence memory, and by this trend, it looks

7
00:00:30,146 --> 00:00:35,669
like it probably does. But, many other factors can also influence memory, and

8
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:41,164
this varies by person. There's a relationship here between hours slept and

9
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:46,779
temporal memory score, but that doesn't mean that hours slept causes a higher

10
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:52,369
temporal memory score. In other words, correlation does not prove causation.
