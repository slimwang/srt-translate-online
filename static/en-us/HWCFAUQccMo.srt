1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,370
Now, we're talking about what
the user is going to type in.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:09,470
So the user for the login field we have
in the form, that's the value that

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,890
goes to this variable that we have here,
is actually typing something strange.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:20,660
So what your types is, in these codes,
it's the space code, or 1 = 1.

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,390
And it's important that these
two dashes here that we have,

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,120
they really say that everything
that follows is a comment, and

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,470
is to be ignored, is not to be executed.

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:36,110
So the way to think about this is that,
I'm not typing anything for password.

9
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,930
I'm not typing anything for PIN.

10
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,980
For login, I'm typing this
information that I have here.

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:47,390
So, if I did that, this script that we
have here is going to generate a query.

12
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,310
And that query is going to be run
against the database that we have

13
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,530
as we did before.

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,310
So the quiz question here is asking,

15
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,660
well what is going to happen
when this query is run?
