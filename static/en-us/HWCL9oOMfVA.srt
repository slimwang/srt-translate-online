1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,600
That's right. Maps isn't visible 
or running any services,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,295
so it's the most likely to be killed.

3
00:00:05,295 --> 00:00:07,810
Gmail is running a service, 
but it's not interacting

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,310
directly with the user.

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,850
While Google Music 
and the camera app are.

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,720
Of those two, the Music app
must have been in the foreground

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,290
for longer than the camera.

8
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,820
So it's got a slightly lower priority,

9
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,310
though neither are in 
any danger of being killed.
