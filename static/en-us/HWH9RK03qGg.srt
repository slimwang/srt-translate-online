1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,120
The objectives of this lesson are for us
to learn about, what is a video texture,

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,270
the concept of video texture itself.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,210
Talk about different methods to
compute similarity between frames.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,430
We will talk about how we can use
similar frames to find transitions

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,340
to generate video textures.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,330
And then basically talk about additional
things like how can we fade, cut and

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,230
morph for video textures again
something we have done for

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,110
images in previous lectures.

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,340
And finally, I'll talk about a variety
of applications of video textures.
