1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,330
Let's look into whether bootstrapping
your business is the right

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,680
option for you.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,020
Before we get started,
what is bootstrapping?

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,540
Bootstrapping is the act
of financing your business

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,870
using your own personal resources.

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,790
You'll use what you currently have
available to start building and

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,510
growing your company.

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,660
There are a few things to be aware of
before considering bootstrapping for

9
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,720
your business.

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,390
First let's look at
some of the benefits.

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,220
We'll focus on three major benefits
of bootstrapping, freedom,

12
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,150
profits and commitment.

13
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,890
First, freedom.

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,900
Financing your business yourself
provides you a level of freedom not

15
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,730
available to you once
investors become involved.

16
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,080
Sometimes you need to be flexible and
make tough choices.

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,710
Being on your own, you don't need
to rationalize with investors.

18
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,410
This will allow you to make your own
decisions about what is best for

19
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,570
the company.

20
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,520
That said,
you can't build a business in a vacuum.

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,000
Successful bootstrappers leverage their
personal and professional networks and

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,080
grow their businesses organically.

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,200
Remember to focus on your customer base,
social presence, and

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,560
the momentum you generate through
your business's popularity.

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,340
Next, profits.

26
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,240
Without investors, the profits your
business generates come straight to you.

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,220
When bootstrapping, you retain equity in
your company and hold shares that would

28
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,920
normally go to investors if they
had put money into your startup.

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,020
And finally, commitment.

30
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,110
There's nothing that gets you motivated
to figure out your business quite like

31
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,770
financing it yourself.

32
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,120
Bootstrapping can give you the extra
incentive needed to work the long hours

33
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,290
necessary to become successful.

34
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,350
This experience can definitely help you
become a more resourceful entrepreneur.

35
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,430
While there are benefits
to bootstrapping,

36
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,180
it's important to understand some
ways it might not be so great.

37
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,520
Let's focus on three major downsides of
bootstrapping, expenses, connections,

38
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,180
and credibility.

39
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,040
First, expenses.

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,510
Launching your startup
can take a lot of money.

41
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,100
Trying to supply this on your own
can become detrimental to your

42
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,710
personal expenses.

43
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,180
This could end up affecting
decisions you make.

44
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,980
If you're low on money,
you might end up making changes that

45
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,660
aren't in the best interest of your
company to chase early profits.

46
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,340
This can really stunt
your long term growth.

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,210
Next, connections.

48
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,800
A lot of investors have been
in business for many years and

49
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,260
have access to tons of resources.

50
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,450
Working on your own you have less
of these resources available for

51
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,650
your business.

52
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,330
You also lose any access to the people
within the investors network who could

53
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,600
advise you as you build your company.

54
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,620
When bootstrapping,

55
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,410
you're missing out on some of
these opportunities for growth.

56
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,300
And finally,

57
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,000
being backed by the right investor gives
immediate credibility to your business.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,330
When bootstrapping you might not
be able to get this otherwise.

59
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,740
Without investor support,

60
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,530
it could make it more difficult to
get investment in later seed rounds.

61
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,910
So, take some time to
consider the benefits and

62
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,910
downsides of Bootstrapping your startup.

63
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,530
When you're ready, decide if you
think this would be a good option for

64
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,190
your business.
