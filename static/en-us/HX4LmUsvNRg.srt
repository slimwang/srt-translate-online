00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,120
As we saw earlier on in the course,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,730
the complement of a minimum vertex
cover is a maximum independent set.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,510
It's natural to ask then,
can we turn our factor two algorithm for

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,910
a minimum vertex cover into an algorithm
for maximum independent set.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,560
Such an approach yields what about
the maximum independent set problem?

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,750
