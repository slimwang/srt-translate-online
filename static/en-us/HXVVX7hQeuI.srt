00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,568
As a refresher, I'm showing you the

2
00:00:02,568 --> 00:00:06,500
seven layer OSI reference model of the protocol

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,290
stack. Now, load management, as I mentioned, for

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,030
dealing with client requests, can be done at

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:19,700
any of the levels of the seven layer OSI model. From the network layer and

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,650
up. And higher the layer, you have more

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,470
functionality that you can associate with the load

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,960
manager in the terms of, how it deals with the

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,710
server failures, how it deals with directing incoming client requests

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,170
to the different servers, all of these are possible, the

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,980
higher the layer at which you construct the load manager.
