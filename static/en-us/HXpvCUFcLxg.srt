1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
One way to think about this is, imagine this last level is filled in all the way to the end.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Then what's happening here is we have, how many nodes we have at that level?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We have half as many at the level above because each of the nodes

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
shares a parent with one of the other nodes and again half and again half and again half.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How many times can you half (n) before you get down to 1 which is the root?

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And that's what we've been talking about if that's (log n). So the height of the heap is Î(log n).
