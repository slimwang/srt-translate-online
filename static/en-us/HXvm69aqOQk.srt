1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,350
Congratulations.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,760
You now have a server updated and

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,210
configured, sitting out there on
the wild west that is the internet.

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,930
Best of all, you can rest easy at night
knowing your server is safe and secure.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,930
Where you do go from here?

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,590
It depends on your needs.

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,200
There are a lot of different
types of servers, email servers,

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,040
chat servers, web application servers.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,270
Generally, the only big
differences between each of these

10
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,030
is the software they have installed and
the ports that they have open.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,220
I've placed a few server set-up walk
throughs in the instructor notes below,

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,200
that should get you started.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,540
I'd encourage you to start by
setting up a web application server,

14
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,210
installing Apache in a database
server like PostgreSQL.

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,070
Good luck, have fun, and
remember, experiment.

16
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,080
This is your own little
piece of the Internet.
