1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,100
But look down here into
this safe profile method.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,230
This is supposed to save a profile
that the user has submitted and

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,910
return the updated profile.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,390
But right now all it does is well,
very same thing as get profile.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,265
Now what this should do
is take display name and

6
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:19,260
t-shirt size from a post request and
update the output accordingly.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,010
It's not going to save anything yet, but

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,340
it should return the same
thing that it's given.

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,530
And that's your job in the first
programming exercise for

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,000
this conference central app.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,396
You should modify the save profile
function to use the appropriate

12
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:33,800
messages.message class from models.py,
and

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,130
pick the one that can send two fields,
displayName and teeShirtSize.

14
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,750
Then for the method to be able
to return the changed values,

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,000
you'll have to pass that request
up to the doProfile function.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,490
Complete the steps outlined in TODO
1 and deploy the app locally and

17
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,760
test by changing display name and
t-shirt size in the request.

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,220
You should see the changed
values in the response.

19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,810
Once you're done,
check off the completed steps and

20
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,150
enter your appspot project ID.
