00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,060
Let us revisit the architecture for a cognitive system.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,190
We have come across this several times earlier in this course. We can think in

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:12,350
terms of three different spaces. A Metacognitive space, a Deliberative space,

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:17,090
and a Reactive space. The Reactive space directly maps percepts from

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,020
the environment into actions in the environment. The Deliberative space

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,330
maps the percepts into actions, with the mappings mediated by reasoning and

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,380
learning and memory. So, while this is a see act cycle,

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,757
this is a see think act cycle. The metacognitive space

9
00:00:35,757 --> 00:00:40,630
monitors the deliberative reasoning. It sees the deliberative reasoning and

10
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:45,270
acts on the deliberative reasoning. As we had discussed earlier, it's better to

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,320
think of these in terms of overlapping spaces rather than disjoint layers.

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,510
When we were discussing metacognition we also saw that we could draw arrows back

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,820
from here like this because metacognition could also act on its own.

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,990
This cognitive system is situated in the world.

15
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,430
It is getting many different kind of input from the world. Percepts,

16
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,870
signals, goals, communication with other agents. Depending on the input, and

17
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,750
depending upon the resources available to the agent to address that input,

18
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,300
the agent may simply react to the input and give an output in the form of

19
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,460
an action to a percept, for example. Or the agent may reason about the input.

20
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,310
And then decide on an action after consulting memory and

21
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,610
perhaps invoking learning and reasoning. In some cases,

22
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,630
the input that the agent receives might be as a result of the output it

23
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,720
had given to a prior input. For example, it may have received a goal.

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,166
Then come up with a plan. When it had received the input of the plan,

25
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:48,130
failed upon execution. In that case, deliberation can give an alternative plan.

26
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,140
A metacognition may wonder about, why did the planner fail in the first place?

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,350
And repair the planner, not just the plan. Just like reaction and

28
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,390
deliberation are situated in the world outside, metacognition, in a way,

29
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,940
is situated in the world inside. It is acting on the mental world.

30
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,620
While deliberation and reaction act on the objects in the external environment.

31
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,263
For metacognition it is the thoughts and the learning and

32
00:02:12,263 --> 00:02:16,620
the reasoning that are objects internally in the amygdala. Of course,

33
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,850
this input is coming constantly. Even now, as you and I are communicating,

34
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:26,510
both you and I are receiving input. And we're giving output as well. In fact,

35
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,820
the cognitive system is constantly situated in the world. It is never separate

36
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,640
from the world. There is no way to separate it. It has input coming constantly.

37
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,460
There is output going out constantly. The world is constantly changing,

38
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,120
and the cognitive system is constantly receiving information about the world.

39
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,595
It uses this knowledge in it's knowledge structure to make sense of

40
00:02:46,595 --> 00:02:50,920
the data about the world. And it decides on actions to take on the world.

41
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,330
Recall that we had said that intelligence is a function that maps the perceptual

42
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,270
history into action. And to some degree, intelligence is about actions,

43
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:04,090
reactions. About selecting your right output to act on the world. Depending on

44
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,560
the nature of the input the output may vary. If the input is a goal,

45
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,290
the output might be a plan or an action. If the input is a piece of knowledge,

46
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,920
the output might be internal to the cognitive system. And

47
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,130
the cognitive system may assimilate that knowledge in its internal structures.

48
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,020
If the input is a percept, the output might be an action based on that percept.

49
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,245
If the input is new information, the cognitive system will learn from the new

50
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:32,480
information, and then store the result of the learning in its memory. The world

51
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,545
here consists not just of the physical world, but of the social world as well.

52
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:40,260
Thus, this cognitive system is situated not just in the physical world but

53
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,170
is also situated in the social world, consisting of other cognitive systems and

54
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,920
constantly interacts with them. Once again, the interactions between these

55
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,940
cognitive systems can be of many different kinds. Percepts, goals, actions,

56
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,010
plans, information, data. Any cognitive system is not just monitoring and

57
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,640
observing the physical world, but it's also monitoring and

58
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,690
observing the social world, the actions of other cognitive systems in the world,

59
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:09,210
for example. Any cognitive system learns not just from its own actions but also

60
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:13,140
from the actions of other cognitive systems around it. Thus a cognitive system

61
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,890
needs to make sense not just to the physical world but also by the social world.

62
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,649
We saw some of this when we were talking about scripts.

63
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,860
There we saw how a cognitive system used a script to make sense of the actions

64
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,490
of other cognitive systems. This architecture is not merely an architecture for

65
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,840
building AI agents, it is also an architecture for reflecting on human

66
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,470
cognition. Does this architecture explain large portions of human behavior?
