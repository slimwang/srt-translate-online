1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,777
First, the answer for generalization is D, subclassing.

2
00:00:03,777 --> 00:00:08,010
Subclassing is one way of expressing generalization relationships in code.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,100
The answer for aggregation is A, Collection Classes.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,080
Collection classes are designed to support aggregation.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,010
Examples in Java include ArrayList, List, Set, and so on.

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,978
The answer for Invariants is B, Methods and Constructors.

7
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:26,240
Constructors are responsible for establishing invariants in the first place.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,090
Subsequently, each method is also responsible for maintaining them.

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,270
And the answer for States is C, Enumerations.

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,780
Simple states can be modeled as enumerations, such as moods like happy,

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,400
sleepy, sad.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,100
Java supports adding behaviors to enumeration instances,

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,290
enabling custom actions.
