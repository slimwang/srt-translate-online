00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,507
The correct choice is this third one. For any number n, the square root of n is

2
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:08,939
equivalent to some number that when multiplied by itself, gives us n. I know

3
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:13,599
that this is a lot of words, so let's just break that down. Squaring a number or

4
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:18,081
taking it to the second power, we know means, multiplying it by itself. So, if

5
00:00:18,093 --> 00:00:23,767
we have 3 squared, that's just two threes multiplied together. But I know that

6
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:28,386
if I take the square root of 3 squared, then I can get just the 3 back. So,

7
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:33,620
taking a square root can undo this repeated multiplication. The square root of

8
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:38,682
any number then like n, for example, tells us what we need to multiply by itself

9
00:00:38,694 --> 00:00:39,201
to get n.
