00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,890
Now I am very sure that you have figured out a pattern by now,

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,860
so let's draw a really long one.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,200
Of course, I'm going to ask you the same questions,

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,230
but this is the last time I'm going to ask you those two questions.

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,610
So, please once more, what is length of the shortest path from A to B?

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,180
And what is the number of shortest paths from A to B?

7
00:00:17,180 --> 99:59:59,999
By shortest path, I mean one that visits all vertices, as in the examples before.
