00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,428
>> Looking back at the past four polynomials that we've factored, we can notice

2
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:08,844
something super important about each of the factors that we got. And that is

3
00:00:08,844 --> 00:00:13,434
that there are no common terms left within any of these factors. So we don't see

4
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:18,054
anything like 3x minus 9 in here, for example. Because if we saw that, we would

5
00:00:18,054 --> 00:00:22,338
know to rewrite it as 3 times the quantity x minus 3. So you always want to

6
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:26,628
double check at the end of your factoring process that each of your factors is,

7
00:00:26,628 --> 00:00:30,930
in fact, fully factored itself. Keep that in mind with this upcoming problem.
