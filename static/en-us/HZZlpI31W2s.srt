1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
This course is about exactly these challenging problems.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,290
Problems that are really, really tough for computers to solve.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,470
But it is also a course about what to do with those challenging problems.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:17,950
So how you can solve them using a computer despite them being very hard to solve.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,480
Now, the part of computer science that deals with challenging problems

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,970
is called theoretical computer science.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,600
The first part of theoretical computer science that we will be looking at is called complexity theory.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:35,410
And complexity theory is the science of how much, or more specifically, how much resources.

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:41,480
So time, or memory, and also other resources a computer will need to solve a given problem.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,050
The other part of theoretical computer science that we'll be looking at is called computability.

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,040
And computability asks the more fundamental question.

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,820
Computability asks, can a computer solve a given problem at all,

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,660
given as much time and as much memory as you want?

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,680
Now, this course will be mostly looking at complexity theory,

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,000
but we'll also do computability for 2 reasons:

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,170
First of all, it kind of belongs in the whole picture,

17
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,640
to say what computers can do and cannot do.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,170
And the other reason is that many problems that fall into the area of computability

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,860
are actually very relevant, and it's important to understand computability

20
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,600
to know what is doable and what isn't.

21
00:01:20,600 --> 99:59:59,999
And it's also important to understand computability to know what's possible in general and what isn't.
