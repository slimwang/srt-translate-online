Okay, let' just right into things with a quiz. So, why do we scale,

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,280
you know. What problems are we solving when we, when we scale things? Do we

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,350
scale so we can serve more requests concurrently? So we can store more data? So

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,010
we're more resilient to failure? So we

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,880
can serve requests faster? Check all that apply.
