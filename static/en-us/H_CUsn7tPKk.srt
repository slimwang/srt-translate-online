1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,610
Well, this is actually a case
of mandatory access control,

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:08,990
because, if you create a relation, well
you don't decide who has access to it.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,820
If that was the case,

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,490
then it would be discretionary
access control at your discretion.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,880
But we know that database and
tables that are there in the database,

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,450
access control is done by
trusted users centrally.

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,590
So that is mandatory access control.
