1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,918
So the average program is in better shape than it was at first. It can now take

2
00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:07,005
averages that include zero, but it still chokes when the user doesn't enter

3
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:11,750
enough numbers. What we would really want would be to print out an error if the

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:17,230
user enters no numbers and count to zero. So, when we run our program, it would

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,926
ask us to enter a value, and if we enter a bad value like s, it would say

6
00:00:20,926 --> 00:00:26,146
error, no input. But if we enter values like we did before, it'll calculate the

7
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:30,651
average. Fix the average class, so that it prints out a sensible error, if

8
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:33,030
count ends up at zero.
