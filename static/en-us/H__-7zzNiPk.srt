1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,200
So here you have goals
you're trying to accomplish,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,980
sort of positive things you're trying
to do and then you have constraints.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,615
Basically I want you to eat little dots,

4
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:11,140
eat big dots and
eat big ghosts while honoring

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,010
the constraint that I don't want you
to be eaten by a non-scared ghost.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,850
>> Okay, yeah, I mean so
now from a logic standpoint,

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,102
we've covered everything.

8
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,022
Success and
things that are defined by success and

9
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:22,920
things that are defined by failure.

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,320
>> Right, and but the failure here,
I mean well, right, in exactly that way.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,700
So why did I bring all this up?

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,250
I brought it up becausem one I just
think it's kind of neat that people

13
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,810
actually come up with these things.

14
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,650
But the other thing that I think is
kind of neat is that it gives us a hint,

15
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,430
it gives us two hints actually.

16
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,580
It gives us a hint about how we might
do a better job than just simply

17
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,870
behaving randomly in our rollout policy.

18
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,100
So here's something you might do.

19
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,130
You might say when I get down to here,
rather than behaving randomly.

20
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,290
And where by the way, I sometimes will
get eaten by a ghost even though I

21
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,760
could've easily avoided it.

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,930
I'm going to try to behave
randomly while still

23
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,250
honoring whatever constraints
I happen to have defined.

24
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,480
So here, rather than trying to just
walk around until something bad happens.

25
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,810
I'm going to try to stay
alive as long as possible

26
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,700
which is what this constraint tells me.

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,390
And that's a different kind of
roll-out policy, but one that I

28
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,620
claim that gives you a sort of better
view of the goodness of this state.

29
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:22,131
This state action pair is better
because you can avoid violating your

30
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:27,198
constraints for longer than if you are
say in this state and take this action.

31
00:01:27,198 --> 00:01:28,738
And there are lots of other
things that you might do.

32
00:01:28,738 --> 00:01:32,402
I just sort of wanted to give you
a flavor of it which is that I can use

33
00:01:32,402 --> 00:01:36,334
these sort of options if they are of
a certain type in order to be smarter

34
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:38,560
about the way I do my roll-out policy.

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,630
There's also another way
that we can do this.

36
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:46,020
I can still use options in general,
in this entire search up here before.

37
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,940
Rather than taking primitive action and
doing my search through the tree in my

38
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:57,399
expansion, I can replace this with
my actions with options as well.

39
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,160
Ooh.
And what's the big win there?

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,270
Well the big win there is,

41
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,990
by following the options,
I'm getting deeper into the tree.

42
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,180
>> Yeah,
it's the same kind of idea as in

43
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,830
the option case that we
talked about already.

44
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,200
Except now we're in trees instead of,
I guess, grids.

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,770
Yes, but trees and grids,
it turns out they're all the same thing.

46
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,620
So there's lots of things
you can talk about.

47
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,520
There's been a lot of
work in this space.

48
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,450
Some of them are available as
readings for the students.

49
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,810
I recommend thinking about them but

50
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,995
what's I think kind of nice about
it is that this general notion of

51
00:02:28,995 --> 00:02:34,420
treatingm solving an MDP not as
just I've got to solve the MDP,

52
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,630
but as a kind of tree search problem
where we take advantage of and use

53
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,640
the randomness is something that unifies
a lot of approaches that you might have.

54
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,360
>> Okay, cool.

55
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,790
>> Okay.
And I think that's pretty much.

56
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,290
I'll say one more thing about this and
then I think we're done and

57
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,890
that's just that there are lots
of ways of looking at this.

58
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,320
You might ask yourself is this
even reinforcement learning,

59
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,900
where we've just gone back to searching
and I'm going to claim it is.

60
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,020
I'm going to claim it's
a policy search algorithm.

61
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,150
>> What's your justification for that?

62
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,850
>> Well, my justification for that is,
I'm basically by building this up,

63
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,990
I am doing,
I am searching over possible policies.

64
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,620
And what I'm doing in the inner
loop of searching for

65
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,190
policies is I'm doing a kind
of reinforcement learning

66
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,220
step here when I do my backups and
in fact, the way you do the backups is

67
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,970
you use the Bellman equation as
a way of re=estimating Q values.

68
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,470
And once I have those I now have
another policy that I'm looking at and

69
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,750
I just keep dong that over and
over again.

70
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,123
So I'm really searching through policy
space which is sort of what the tree

71
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:30,030
expansion is.

72
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,010
And I have an inner loop
every time I run out of

73
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,360
my confidence about the policy.

74
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,250
I'm doing a little bit of
reinforcement learning to figure out

75
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,610
what the policy ought to be.

76
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,611
So it's policy search with an inner
loop of evaluation, sort of.

77
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:48,990
>> And
Monte Carlo policy evaluation somehow.

78
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:49,870
>> Right, exactly.

79
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,680
Well that's really what it is and the
way I'm doing the policy evaluation is

80
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,880
by doing this well,
doing the Monte Carlo.

81
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,540
>> So it really combines a lot of

82
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,880
ideas that we've talked about
into kind of one algorithm.

83
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,980
Has this been successful?

84
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,110
>> It has been successful.

85
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,720
I've actually used it in my own work.

86
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,690
It has this really neat feature
that allows you to avoid

87
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,520
searching over lots and
lots of the state space.

88
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,750
It's actually really wonderful.

89
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,920
It actually has a couple of
properties that are worth mentioning.

90
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,779
So let me mention those properties and
then I think we're done.
