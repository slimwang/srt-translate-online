1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,509
To train any classify,
you need label data.

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:04,979
Lots of it.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,740
In this case,

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,800
the two classes you would like to
distinguish are car and non-car images.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,070
So you need samples of both.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,830
If you only have full
video frames available,

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,829
you need to crop out regions and
scale them to a fixed size.

8
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:22,369
Ideally you want a balanced data set.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,450
That is the number of car and
non-car images should be roughly equal.

10
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:29,669
If that's not the case,
you're under risk of the classifier

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,560
trying to predict everything as
belonging to the majority class.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,067
There are some techniques for
handling imbalanced data sets, for

13
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:41,337
example, duplicate some samples from
the smaller class to balance the counts.

14
00:00:41,337 --> 00:00:46,215
For vehicle classification, if you don't
have enough non-car images you could

15
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:48,629
simply extract more from video frames.

16
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:51,100
Okay, once you have a sizable data set,

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,174
you need to split it
into two collections.

18
00:00:54,174 --> 00:00:56,854
A training set and a test set.

19
00:00:56,854 --> 00:01:00,784
As the names suggest, you will
only use images from the training

20
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:02,884
set when training your classifier and

21
00:01:02,884 --> 00:01:07,144
then check how it performs on
unseen examples from the test set.

22
00:01:07,144 --> 00:01:11,384
To avoid any possible ordering effects
in the data, you should sample or

23
00:01:11,385 --> 00:01:16,255
shuffle the data set randomly when
splitting it for training and testing.

24
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:19,399
Even within the training and
test sets, you should aim for

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,390
a balance between the number of car and
non car images.

26
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,519
All of this preprocessing might
seem like a lot of work but

27
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:32,079
machine learning logarithms work on
a principle of garbage in, garbage out.

28
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,329
So you need to be careful
about what you feed them.
