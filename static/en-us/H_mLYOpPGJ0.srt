1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,988
It turns out we want to multiply each part by the cube root of 3 squared x

2
00:00:03,988 --> 00:00:10,132
squared y squared. We want to multiply by enough factors of 3 x and y. To turn

3
00:00:10,132 --> 00:00:15,129
each of these powers into these powers. So for 3 to the 1, we want to multiply

4
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:20,787
by 3 square to get 3 cubed. For x to the 7th, we multiply by x squared to get x

5
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:26,370
to the 9th and for y to the 4th we multiply by y squared to get y to the 6.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,780
Keep in mind that this expression needs to be inside of a cubed root for us to

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,693
multiply these factors together. And since we multiplied this denominator by

8
00:00:34,693 --> 00:00:39,560
this amount we must also multiply our numerator by the same amount. We're

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,813
multiplying by a form of 1.
