00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,549
No is the right answer here, if you got it, great work. We can check to see if

2
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:09,211
this point is the solution to our system by plugging in the values of x and y, x

3
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:13,469
is 20 and y is 40. Be careful with the second equation, we know that the x

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,889
should be 20 so we want to make sure we plug that into the second term here.

5
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:22,498
Just because the variables come in order in our point doesn't mean they'll

6
00:00:22,498 --> 00:00:27,016
appear in order in our equation. So be careful when you plug in. Our first

7
00:00:27,016 --> 00:00:31,759
equation checks, 20 equals 20. Our second equation doesn't check. We know 40

8
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,421
does not equal 15. So this point can't be a solution for our system. It's not

9
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:38,113
the point of intersection.
