00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,182
Now let's do some long division practice. What is 2 x cubed minus x squared

2
00:00:04,182 --> 00:00:10,420
minus 19 x plus 12 divided by x minus 3? Please write your answer in here. And

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,911
remember to write it in the standard form for polynomials. In order of

4
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:17,353
descending degrees, starting with the highest.
