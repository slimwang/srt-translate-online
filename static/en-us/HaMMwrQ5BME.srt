00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,669
So let's talk about shapes as variables. Here are the two important points I

2
00:00:03,681 --> 00:00:07,521
wanted you to think about. First, is that variables can be assigned a value and

3
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:11,319
replaced. Just like this circle. I could have had a triangle minus 5. I take

4
00:00:11,331 --> 00:00:15,175
this symbol, the circle, or this variable, and replace it with this assigned

5
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:19,291
value, of 5. The other important part, is that some variable are unknown. And

6
00:00:19,303 --> 00:00:23,622
there value can vary or change. This happened with my triangle, I can plug in

7
00:00:23,634 --> 00:00:27,854
any number for my triangle, for example, the triangle can be 10, so that 10

8
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:32,185
minus, which would equal 5. Or the triangle could be negative 31 and I've had

9
00:00:32,197 --> 00:00:36,510
negative 31 minus 5, or negative 36. Or the triangle could be a 1035, and I

10
00:00:36,522 --> 00:00:41,093
would get 1030. The triangle could take on any value. This is a powerful concept

11
00:00:41,105 --> 00:00:45,273
in Algebra. The idea that a variable could take on any number. We'll return to

12
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:50,228
this idea later. For now, just remember that variables can be unknown. And the

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,889
value can change or vary. Your probably not use to seeing shapes when doing

14
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:57,787
math. You're probably use to seeing x. Mathematicians have usually used x. And

15
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:01,532
it actually originates from the Arabic langauge, it means something unknown.
