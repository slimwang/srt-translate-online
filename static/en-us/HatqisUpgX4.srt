00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,385
Now this is kind of a funny question with
some funny answers, and so depending on

2
00:00:04,397 --> 00:00:09,203
your thinking, you might picked any of
these answers. I personally though, think

3
00:00:09,203 --> 00:00:14,226
that the best answer is the third one, to
count them. If the teacher counts her

4
00:00:14,226 --> 00:00:17,620
students before they leave and then counts
them at different points during their time

5
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:21,680
at the zoo, she can know pretty easily
whether or not they are all sticking

6
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:27,733
together. Congratulations on completing
your first quiz of the class whether you

7
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:31,681
picked the same answer as I did or not.
You'll encounter many quizzes like this

8
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:34,967
throughout the rest of the course.
Although they probably won't all be as

9
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:38,885
silly as this one. But please remember
that even as we dig deeper into algebra,

10
00:00:38,982 --> 00:00:43,235
the point of all of these quizzes will be
for you to check if you understand the

11
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:47,948
material. Just give each question some
thought and if you're have trouble

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,009
choosing an answer, rewatch the video or
couple of videos preceding the quiz. If

13
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:58,049
you get a question right that's awesome
and if you miss one that's not a big deal

14
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:03,281
at all. Just try it again and submit your
new answer. You can redo each question as

15
00:01:03,293 --> 00:01:08,140
many times as you need to. We want you to
do whatever you need to do to really

16
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:09,898
understand the material.
