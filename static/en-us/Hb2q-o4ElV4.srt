00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,901
All right, so let's look at the first one. We have our sample mean, x bar minus

2
00:00:05,901 --> 00:00:13,204
the z score times the standard deviation meaning we have this number of standard

3
00:00:13,204 --> 00:00:22,445
deviations less than the mean. And that's what we did with z here being 1.96,

4
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:29,073
since this is 95%. And then over here on the other side, we have our sample mean

5
00:00:29,073 --> 00:00:35,170
plus z amounts of standard deviations or standard errors. So this is what we did

6
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,106
to find the confidence interval. However we did not subtract Z standard

7
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:46,006
deviations from the population mean. Remember the original population mean was

8
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:51,190
point zero seven, seven, If we did that then we would get a confidence interval

9
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:56,092
for the original population mean. And that's not what we're interested in. This

10
00:00:56,092 --> 00:01:02,581
third one, we have our sample mean, minus and instead of Z we have the actual Z

11
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:10,024
value, 1.96 times the standard error. So we have 1.96 standard errors less than

12
00:01:10,024 --> 00:01:16,203
this sample mean. So that is what we get. And same with over here we have 1.96

13
00:01:16,203 --> 00:01:21,556
standard error plus the sample mean. And this one doesn't really make sense

14
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:26,868
because we can't just subtract the number of standard deviations, we need to

15
00:01:26,868 --> 00:01:32,180
multiply this number of standard deviations by what the standard deviation

16
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,226
actually is. To find the distance away from the sample mean we need to go.

17
00:01:37,226 --> 00:01:40,373
Hopefully that makes sense. Great job.
