1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,760
All right, why don't we walk through the solution?

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,880
Here we define our olympic_medal_counts_df data frame as we have in

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,150
the past couple of exercises.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,160
Then we simply say avg_medal_count is equal to olympic_medal_counts_df and

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,880
we pick out only the gold, silver and bronze columns and

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,239
then we use the data frames apply method and provide us the argument numpy.mean
