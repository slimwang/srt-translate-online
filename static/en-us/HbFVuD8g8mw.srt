1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,880
Let's break down the operations we
just saw on My Favorite Movies and

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,740
determine which API
methods we should use.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,490
Obviously we need to be able to login.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,050
And this is going to
require us to authenticate.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,990
And this step can be very complex.

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,220
It involves a number of substeps and we
are going to cover each of them later.

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,320
So for now, we'll just assume
we've already logged in.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,520
So on the genre tabs,

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,860
we need to be able to get a list of
movies by the genre that's selected.

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,510
Then for favorites, we need to be able
to get a list of our favorite movies.

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,480
Finally once we selected a movie,
we need to able to add or

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,960
remove it from our favorites lists.

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,380
So to complete this exercise, we need
to determine which methods to use.

14
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,440
So to start your search, you want to
open up the documentation for

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,640
the movie database API.

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,300
When you've found
the correct method names,

17
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,720
enter them in the text boxes
next to each question.

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,250
I've included a link to the
documentation in the instructor notes.
