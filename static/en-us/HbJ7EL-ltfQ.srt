The answer is null. The program creates a second thread, but this thread first

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,160
sleeps. Hence we can count on the main thread printing out the current value of

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,129
msg, which we had just set to null. And then, we can also count on

4
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,520
exiting and terminating the whole program before

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,140
the thread_proc call here gets to do anything.
