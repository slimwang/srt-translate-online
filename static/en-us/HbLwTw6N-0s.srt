1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,420
So the answer is no. That it does not and the key reason why it does not is

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,690
there's no base case. Without a base case, it's

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,050
not a recursive definition. What it is, is a

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,610
circular definition. And that means that it actually doesn't

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,430
give us any answers. Because we'll never finish here

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,870
right. The only way that we've defined popularity whether

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,920
you look at that mathematical expression or the python code.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,130
Always involves calling popularity again. And we are never going

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,830
to get to a point where we can stop. That we

10
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,000
are going to keep calling popularity for different people. If

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,800
we think of doing this for our friend graph, well here's

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,980
what would happen. If we wanted to know the popularity

13
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,570
of Charlie. Well, we have to look at all the people

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,000
who are friends with Charlie. So, that means that the popularity

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,070
of Diana, the popularity of Edgar, and the popularity of Fred.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,310
But, for each of those, we need to compute their

17
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,220
popularities. To the popularity of Diana, that's going to be

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,240
equal to the popularity of Alice. So, now we're here,

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,260
but we need keep going. And, the popularity of Alice

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,480
is the popularity of Edgar plus the popularity of Bob.

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,050
But we need to keep going. We still need

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,780
the popularity of Edgar well, that's the popularity of Fred.

23
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,140
And we need the popularity of Bob, which is the popularity

24
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,610
of Fred. And we need the popularity of Fred, which

25
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,850
is the popularity of Charlie, plus the popularity of Bob.

26
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,910
So, this is not okay, right? The problem is, we

27
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,650
started trying to figure out the popularity of Charlie, we did

28
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,090
all this work following these links backward. And now, to

29
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,720
solve it, we need to know the popularity of Charlie.

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,980
But that's what we were trying to solve. So

31
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,420
this is not a recursive definition. To be a good recursive

32
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,040
definition, we have to end up with a simpler version of the problem. And never

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,410
go back to the one that we started with. The way we've defined it, we get

34
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,600
back to the one that we started with.

35
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,720
We haven't made any progress. We're never going to

36
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,370
get an answer. Charlie will be very unhappy

37
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,050
because we'll never know how popular he is.
