1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,060
We can use this to now start
building response curves.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,610
So this was what we had in the last
slide, which basically had the log of

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,490
exposure, pixel values, and
these were the three different points.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,180
And we were able to trace them out
in equally, all three of them.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,930
Now assuming unit radiance for
each pixel,

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,800
we basically can kind of start
making an interesting model here.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,850
So what we want to do now is take this
and start kind of figuring out how to

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,320
align them so
then they would have a uniform shape.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,590
So in essence what I took.

10
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,610
The purple values and I want to be
able to shift the turquoise and

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,240
the yellow to create a unique profile.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,000
And basically what that means is I'm
adjusting the radiances to open,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,810
to obtain a smooth response curve.

14
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,350
So I take all three of them,

15
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,730
I basically adjust them out a little bit
to create a nice, smooth response curve.

16
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,880
Once I have this I have actually
gone far in trying to be able

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,710
to create an inverse G,
purely from there.

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,530
Again, remember, G is basically
giving me this information.

19
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,660
I want to be able to get intensity
values and come the other way.
