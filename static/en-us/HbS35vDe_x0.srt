Now we're going to ask one more quiz question to finish off this lesson. How

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,826
many karma points per post on average would you need to be in the top 5% of

3
00:00:08,826 --> 00:00:13,306
Udacity students? This one's a really tricky one. And it requires going

4
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:18,432
backwards. So instead of trying to find the proportion less than or greater than

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:23,449
a certain value, we're trying to find what value will give us this proportion.

6
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:28,575
Try and figure it out yourself. This might take you some time. But I think you

7
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:29,247
can do it.
