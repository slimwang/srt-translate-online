1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,740
Right now we see a picture of a phone
but this isn't actually on our phone.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,430
This is pretty similar to when we
were working with the XML visualizer.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,110
Now we actually want to
see our app on our phone.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,330
To participate you're going to
need a USB cable like this.

5
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:20,575
Now, this USB cable should fit your
Android phone but you will also need.

6
00:00:20,575 --> 00:00:26,500
What do I mean by fit well, I could pick
up my phone and plug this cable into it.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Now, if you don't have these things
there's a slightly more complicated way

8
00:00:29,5 --> 00:00:32,400
you could get up and running, which I'm
going to talk about in the next video.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,540
But if you have both of these items,

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,600
I really encourage you
to use a real device.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,510
It's a lot more fun that way.

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,650
All right.

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,739
First things first.

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,470
Your phone is not set up to let random
code from your computer right on your

15
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,190
phone by default.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,330
So you're going to need to do
a few steps to prep your phone.

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,870
Okay.
So the first step is to become

18
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,129
a developer.

19
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,360
This sounds a little funny.

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,500
When will you know when
you're a developer.

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,100
Well what this actually means is
changing around a couple of settings on

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,680
the phone, which will allow you
to access developer options.

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,390
Once your phone's set up, you'll
connect your phone to your computer

24
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,440
using the USB cable that
I talked about before.

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,590
Now if you're using a Windows machine,
the third step for you and

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,740
Windows only will be
to install a driver.

27
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,970
And the driver's an extra little bit
of software that will allow your

28
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,669
phone to communicate with
your Windows machine.

29
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,740
With Macs, this just works by default,
so you don't have to worry about it.

30
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,800
And finally you'll install your app.

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,810
All right let's start doing these steps.

32
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,400
On newer phones running
in Android 4.2 and

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,140
later, you need to tell your
phone that you're a developer.

34
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,140
This is a pretty simple process
I'll show you right now.

35
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,380
The way to do this is to
navigate to the settings menu.

36
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,450
Once you here, scroll down to
the bottom and click on about phone.

37
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,390
On this menu also scroll
down to the bottom.

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,490
You should see something
that says build number.

39
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,860
Okay so take the builder and
click it seven times cool.

40
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,670
So now suddenly your developer,
wasn't that easy.

41
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,880
Once you're done go ahead
of the back button.

42
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,679
Okay, now in developer options there's
a bunch of fancy sounding options but

43
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,950
what I want you to do is scroll down
until you see USB debugging and

44
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:12,450
then go ahead and click will check box
next to USB debugging to turn it on and

45
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,179
say okay by checking this box it's
allowing your computer to put

46
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,160
applications onto your phone.

47
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
Awesome.

48
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,500
Now that you've enabled that you can
take your handy dandy USB cable plug one

49
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,802
end into the phone and take the other
end and plug it into your computer.

50
00:02:28,802 --> 00:02:31,400
If you're a Windows device there's
one more step to set up your phone

51
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,620
and computer.

52
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,300
Your Windows machine needs
some software called a driver

53
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,550
to communicate with your phone.

54
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,620
I'll start by downloading the driver.

55
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,195
For most phones besides
Google Nexus phones,

56
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:44,167
you could navigate to
the android OEM which stands for

57
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:47,153
Original Equipment Manufacturers
driver website.

58
00:02:47,153 --> 00:02:49,150
[BLANK_AUDIO]

59
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:50,825
A link is provided in
the instructor notes.

60
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:55,959
I'm going to scroll down to the bottom,
here I've a list of drivers for

61
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,990
different phones and I'll go ahead
a double at the appropriate one.

62
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,180
In my case I have a Nexus phone so

63
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,680
I'm going to go up on the page and
click Google USB driver.

64
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,360
This is, again, for Nexus phones.

65
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,150
Okay, so for me, I'm going to go ahead
and download the Google USB driver.

66
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,732
[BLANK_AUDIO]

67
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,440
Unzip it.

68
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,880
I'm going to move this to my desktop.

69
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,790
So at this point I've
downloaded the driver,

70
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,600
I've unzipped it, and
I put it on my desktop.

71
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,590
What you need to do next is double check
that your phone is actually plugged in.

72
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,810
Okay, let's look at our Taskbar.

73
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm going to click on the Start Menu and
go to Computer.

74
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,769
In Windows Explorer, I'm going to
right click on the word here that says

75
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,330
Computer and then I'll go to Manage.

76
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,459
In this left pane here I'm
going to select Device Manager.

77
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,250
So looking through this list,
go ahead and

78
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,160
find the thing that says
other devices and expand it.

79
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,480
Now you should see something
here that refers to your phone.

80
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,965
For example, Nexus S.

81
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:05,505
or A D.B. which stands for
Android Debug Bridge interface.

82
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:10,190
Okay, so I'm going to right click and
select update driver software.

83
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,730
This is going to launch a wizard
that looks like this and

84
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,540
I want to select the one that lets me
browse my computer because remember I

85
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,100
just downloaded it to my desktop.

86
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,579
So I do browse computer and I'm
going to go ahead and click browse and

87
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,800
going to my desktop and
hit OK and hit next.

88
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,100
I might see some security messages
like this go ahead and say install.

89
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,100
All right, cool.

90
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,900
So, this autoplay just
popped up with my Nexus 6 so

91
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,900
that's a good sign that now the computer
is communicating well with my phone.

92
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,950
I'm going to go ahead and close this.

93
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,820
And the final window of
the Wizard says that Windows has

94
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,440
successfully updated your driver
software so that sounds awesome.

95
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,330
I'll go ahead click close.

96
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,349
Basically at this point your phone's
ready to accept the application

97
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,750
from your computer.

98
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,460
Another way of saying that you can now
install apps that you've built on your

99
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,549
computer onto your phone.

100
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,600
Finally we're going to install our
hello world app from the computer

101
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,190
on to the phone.

102
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,100
To do this you're going to go
up to the top of Android Studio

103
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,360
to this green play button and click it.

104
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,700
It will take about ten seconds or
so for the next window to pop up so

105
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,229
be patient at the bottom of the screen

106
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,930
you should be able to see that
there's some process being executed.

107
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,840
Now if everything went as planned your
computer should detect your phone and

108
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,250
listed here.

109
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,520
Make sure you have the chooser running
device radio button clicked and

110
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,740
not the launch emulator
radio button selected.

111
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,170
If you can't see your phone try
unplugging it and replugging it in.

112
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,470
And then try restarting the phone.

113
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,820
If that also doesn't work and

114
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,409
you're on a Windows machine, you might
have installed the wrong driver.

115
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,760
If none of those solutions
seem have solved your problem,

116
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,789
we've created a troubleshooting document
which is linked in the instructor notes.

117
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,600
And you can always try asking your
fellow students for help on chat or

118
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:52,640
in forums.

119
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,719
Okay but hopefully things are working.

120
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,620
You can select your phone and
click the OK button.

121
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,310
After about five seconds, you should
see your phone looks like this.

122
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,300
You've now successfully run your
first Android application on a phone.

123
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:06,570
Awesome work.
