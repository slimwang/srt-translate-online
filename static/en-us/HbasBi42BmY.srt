00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,390
David what did you think and

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:04,850
tell us also why you chose
the answers that you did.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,640
>> So I said that these five were
all birds, each of them have wings,

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,480
each of them have feathers, and
I know that each of them lay eggs.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,005
The other three are kind of interesting.

6
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:17,435
This is a sugar glider, and
it flies, and we often think of

7
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:20,755
flying as a bird behavior, but it
doesn't fly the same way birds do, and

8
00:00:20,755 --> 00:00:22,755
it doesn't have the other
features that birds have.

9
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:26,202
It has fur instead of feathers and
doesn't actually have wings and

10
00:00:26,202 --> 00:00:27,862
we also know it doesn't lay eggs.

11
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,012
A bat is even more interesting.

12
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:32,351
A bat does have wings, but it doesn't
have feathers the way birds do and

13
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:34,332
bats actually give birth to live young.

14
00:00:34,332 --> 00:00:37,022
The platypus shown here is
an interesting case because it actually

15
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:39,242
lays eggs,
it has a bill like a bird does,

16
00:00:39,242 --> 00:00:42,372
and it also has flippers
the way a duck does.

17
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:44,382
But it's still not a bird because
it doesn't have feathers.

18
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:47,810
So I would say that these
five are all our birds.

19
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,190
Some of the things that we often
attribute to birds like flying,

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,450
the blue bird, and
the eagle, and the duck do.

21
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,070
Penguins and
ostriches don't actually do,

22
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,510
but they're still birds because they
meet our other criteria for birds.

23
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,270
>> That was a good answer,
David, thank you.

24
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:06,510
Note that David was able to classify
these eight animals into birds, which

25
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,030
one of these animals belong to the class
of birds and which did not belong to it?

26
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,170
Notice also that he used some
criteria to decide on that.

27
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,800
He has some notion it seems
of what is a typical bird,

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,520
what kind of features
does a typical bird have.

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,460
Here's some notion of what
are the basic conditions that something

30
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,260
must satisfy in order to
be considered a bird.

31
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,270
And if those conditions are not being
satisfied, he would reject them and

32
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,420
say those are not birds.
