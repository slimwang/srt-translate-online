1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,524
Using the model of just buying new
hardware whenever there is a need to run

2
00:00:04,524 --> 00:00:09,050
a slightly different operating system or
to support slightly different

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,218
applications, in that process,
data centers became too large.

4
00:00:13,218 --> 00:00:17,284
At the same time, some of these servers
were really very underutilized.

5
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,718
In fact, on average,

6
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:23,250
the utilization rates in data
centers were around 10, 20% tops.

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,430
So as a result, companies,
now that they had to manage these large

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,880
data centers with lots of machines,
they had to hire more system admins.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,703
So this is a correct choice.

10
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,101
And at the same time,

11
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:42,074
they had to spend more money to host all
of those machines, to power them, so

12
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:46,272
they have higher electric bills,
to cool the data centers since

13
00:00:46,272 --> 00:00:51,630
the machines need to operate within
certain temperature variability.

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,357
So this was basically burning
through their operating budget.

15
00:00:56,357 --> 00:01:01,216
The fact that all of these choices
are correct also translated at that

16
00:01:01,216 --> 00:01:05,322
time of something like
companies spending 70% of their

17
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:09,681
IT budget on operating expenses
versus on capital expenses,

18
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:14,960
like actually buying new hardware or
new software services.

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,925
So then it became apparent that it was
important to revisit virtualization

20
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:24,654
technology as a mechanism for
consolidating some of these workloads on

21
00:01:24,654 --> 00:01:28,830
fewer hardware resources that
will be easier to manage them and

22
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,859
more cost-effective
to actually run them.

23
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,742
And this is why the industry and

24
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:38,384
the community overall revisited these
solutions that were in existence for

25
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:41,590
certain types of platforms for
decades at the time.
