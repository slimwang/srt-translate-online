00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,603
Lets say we randomly assigned people with insomnia to one of two treatment

2
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:09,689
conditions. In one condition, participants received 20 milligrams of ambien, and

3
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:14,568
in the other condition patients received a placebo pill. The participants did

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,795
not know which they received. After taking their pills, the participants slept

5
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:25,085
in a sleep laboratory to help control for lurking variables. The next morning,

6
00:00:25,097 --> 00:00:30,272
they rated their quality of sleep on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being very poor

7
00:00:30,284 --> 00:00:35,030
quality of sleep and 10 being excellent. They reported this scale to a

8
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:40,371
psychologist who also did not know which treatment each person was assigned to.

9
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:45,345
It turns out that the people in the ambien group reported a higher quality of

10
00:00:45,357 --> 00:00:50,295
sleep with an average of 8, whereas the people in the placebo group reported an

11
00:00:50,307 --> 00:00:54,920
average of 5. What can we say is true about this scenario? Select all that

12
00:00:54,932 --> 00:00:55,295
apply.
