00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,284
We need to divide distance by speed to find time. Let's look at this equation

2
00:00:04,284 --> 00:00:08,732
to figure out why. Time is in the denominator, so let's multiply both sides by

3
00:00:08,732 --> 00:00:14,500
time. Then we have that speed times time equals distance. Now we just need to

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,849
divide both sides by speed. And we get time equals distance over speed.
