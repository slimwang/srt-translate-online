1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,710
Let's discuss the solution for the second performance

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,810
comparison quiz. Now the laptop that we had took

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,242
10 minutes, and the new one takes 4

4
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:11,434
hours because we are actually using the old laptop

5
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:14,540
to do this. The speedup is equal to

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,230
the latency of the previous thing, which is 10

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,470
minutes, divided by the latency of the new

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,160
thing we're using which is 240, so this time

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,960
the speedup is 0.04. So the correct answer

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,137
here is 0.04. Again, if there is an actual

11
00:00:32,137 --> 00:00:35,295
slowdown from the previous thing to the new thing

12
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:38,144
we are using, then we can expect the speedup

13
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,115
to be lower than 1. And if got instead

14
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:44,186
of 24 as our answer, that should mean that

15
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:47,920
whatever we are using now is faster than before.

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,120
So that should tell us that something is wrong.

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,294
So pretty much, by kind of checking if it makes sense,

18
00:00:53,294 --> 00:00:56,951
you know, is the new thing actually having a speedup as opposed

19
00:00:56,951 --> 00:01:00,178
to slow down? If it is a speedup it should be

20
00:01:00,178 --> 00:01:03,940
above 1, a speedup lower than 1 is an actual slow down.
