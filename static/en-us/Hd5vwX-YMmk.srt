Nice work. Now,

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,490
you should be done with Cat Clicker Duo with two cats in your program.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,260
Now let's take another minute to reflect on your experience.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,480
How hard was it this time?

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,440
How do you feel about your code, and are you happy with your method for

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,910
cat duplication.

7
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,060
And how many times have you clicked your cat by now?

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,080
Then we'll check in with Andy.
