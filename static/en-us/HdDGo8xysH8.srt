1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,970
Well, to get some
inspiration about this,

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:05,870
let's talk about what humans do, and
visual object categories in humans.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,640
And there was work in
what is referred to as

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,648
Basic Level Categories
in human categorization.

5
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:14,060
It was st started by Eleanor Rosch,

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,370
series of seminal
papers back in the 70s.

7
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,010
Continued on by Lakoff and
other cognitive scientists.

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,170
And what they found is,
there are certain levels of description

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,790
that seem to have a preferred
place in human cognition.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,270
So for example, the basic level was
the highest level in the category,

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,990
which you could say that objects have
the same, or similar, perceived shape.

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,760
So if I ask you to think of the shape
of a German Shepherd you can, but

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,510
if i ask you to think of the shape of
a dog, you probably can do that too.

14
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,150
If I ask you to think of
the shape of a mammal,

15
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,850
what you're going to do is you're
going to think of the shape of a couple

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,930
of representative types of mammals.

17
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,540
You don't actually have a shape for
mammal.

18
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,350
Typically also,
you can make a mental image.

19
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,480
If I say, you know,
make a mental image of a dog,

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,280
you'll probably come up with something.

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,970
If I say make a mental image
of an animal, you're going to

22
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,500
pick some animal and then if I were to
ask you what it was you wouldn't tell me

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,460
it's an animal you would tell me it
was a deer or something like that.

24
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,820
By the way you can do
reaction time experiments,

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,482
where, let's suppose you want to ask
people to push a button yes or no.

26
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:14,930
I'm going to show them a picture and

27
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,610
one task is you're supposed
to say is it an animal?

28
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,330
Another task you're supposed
to say whether it's a dog.

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,676
It turns out you're faster at knowing
that it's a dog than you are at knowing

30
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:24,550
it's an animal.

31
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,290
And that's a very robust finding and
you, you can, you can do that.

32
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,390
And then there's this thing that

33
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,000
typically this is the level that
children understand earlier.

34
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:35,374
So they'll learn about dogs before
they'll learn about animals,

35
00:01:35,374 --> 00:01:36,760
they'll learn these words.

36
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,330
And there's one written here about
having motor actions interact.

37
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,930
You can imagine there's a set of things
you do with dogs that sort of span

38
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,100
dogs, right?

39
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,250
Right?
It's probably not the same set of things

40
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,490
you do with animals.

41
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,000
Right?

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,120
You probably pet dogs.

43
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,410
You probably want to pet most dogs.

44
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,432
Probably pet all dogs generically
if you're a dog person.

45
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,340
The idea is that you have these,
these interactions.

46
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,580
So there's this preferred
level within the human.

47
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,870
And you might wonder why I'm spending so
much time talking to you about this.

48
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,720
Well if you go to the MIT libraries and
you type in,

49
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,240
you could actually find this called NOC,
natural object categorization,

50
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,470
which by the way,
was my PhD thesis back in 1987.

51
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,700
Please don't go and read it,
it's not so great, but

52
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,040
I was worried about this notion
of perceptual, organization and

53
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,400
how you would organize your categories
to make them good for perception.

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,460
The one thing I lucked out on is
that by the time I did my thesis,

55
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:33,410
the AI tech reports were up to 1001, so
I got tech support 1001 as the number,

56
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,730
and and that's great because it sounded
like it was an important one or first.
