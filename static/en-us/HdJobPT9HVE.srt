1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay. Back here, check off another bird.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Just one left. Well, okay, I lied. It's not quite one left.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There is also scoring we'll have to do next, but one left for this part.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So all plays, like horizontal plays, takes a hand and the board.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What should it return? Well, it's going to be a set, the position in which we start the word.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, that can be the same as before, an i-j position is perfectly good.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now, we're also going to have some words going across and some words going down.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now, we want our results to be a three tuple.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's a set of an ij position followed by a direction--across or down,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
followed by a word, a set of those.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now onto the all_plays function--takes a hand in the board,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
it's going to return all plays in both directions on any square

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
so the play is a position, direction, and a word where the position is an ij pair,

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
j picked up row number, i the column number.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Direction is either across or down, and those will just be global variables.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We don't have to decide for now how to represent it.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I used a trick here--I said all the horizontal plays, the cross plays,

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
we get from calling horizontal plays directly on the hand in the board.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The vertical plays--I didn't have to write a separate function.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
All I have to do is transpose the board--flop the i and the j, call horizontal plays on that,

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and that gives me a set of results, but they're the results in the wrong direction.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They're ji pairs rather than ij pairs.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Now your task is write the code to put that all together

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
to take these two sets, one of them is in reversed order, so they have to be swapped around.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Neither set has a direction associated with it.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Assemble them all into the resulting set that should be returned by all plays.
