1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,689
Once the user's location preference 
has been stored,

2
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:05,800
when do we make use of it? 
We need the preferred location

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,060
when we query the weather service. 
Luckily, in lesson two,

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,620
we modified fetch weather task 
to accept a location parameter.

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,309
We hard coded it to be 
the Mountain View zip code,

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,500
but now we should use 
the location stored in shared preferences.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,000
We haven't explicitly shown 
you how to do this,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,940
so you might need 
to do some digging around

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,580
on the Ander developer site
to figure out how to do it.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,850
Once you've made the change, 
check the box to continue.
