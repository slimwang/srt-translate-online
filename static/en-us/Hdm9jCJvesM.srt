[Narrator] The next question is challenging.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Consider state C4, which one is the optimal action

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
provided that you can run around as long as you want.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There's no costs associated with steps, but

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
you wish to maximize the probability of ending up in plus 100 over here.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Think before you answer this question.
