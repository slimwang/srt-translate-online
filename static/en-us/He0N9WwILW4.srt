00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,570
Let's now talk about internet routing security or problems involving

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:10,285
securing the internet's routing protocol. We will primarily focus on

3
00:00:10,285 --> 00:00:15,220
inter-domain routing or the security of BGP. We will

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,290
further focus on control plane security. Which typically involves

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,400
authentication of the messages being advertised by the

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,230
routing protocol. In particular, the goal of

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,259
control plane security, or control plane authentication

8
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,820
is to determine the veracity of routing

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,000
advertisements. There are various aspects of the

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,120
routing protocol that we seek to verify.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,915
One, is session authentication, which protects the

12
00:00:43,915 --> 00:00:47,280
point-to-point communication between routers. A second type

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,720
of control plane authen, authentication is path authentication,

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,620
which protects the AS path, and sometimes other attributes. Another type

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,640
of authentication is origin authentication. Which protects the origin

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,120
AS in the AS path; effectively guaranteeing that the

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,330
origin AS that advertises a prefix is, in fact, the owner of that prefix.
