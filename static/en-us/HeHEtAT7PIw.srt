There are several means by which your performance will be evaluated for

3
00:00:20,756 --> 00:00:25,130
this course. First are quizzes that you will take while watching lessons on

4
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:30,270
Udacity. These quizzes are not graded. But are included to evaluate your

5
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,640
understanding of material as you follow along. In terms of graded evaluation,

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,470
this course includes projects, assignments, class participation and

7
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,050
an exam. The projects and some of the assignments are team based. And

8
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,960
all members of the team will receive the same score on that submittal.

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,400
That said, you will have an opportunity to comment on the contributions, or

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,220
lack there, of your teammates. Those comments will become part of

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,690
their class participation scores. The staff of this course,

12
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,750
will make a strong effort to express the grading criteria for each deliverable,

13
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,590
as explicitly as possible. Moreover, it is our intent to provide you accurate,

14
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,220
prompt and informative feedback on your work. Should you have any

15
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,530
questions about a grade you receive, please send an email to the head TA.

16
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,410
Do not post a question about grades on Piazza. Any general announcements about

17
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,079
grading, will be made by the staff using T-Square.
