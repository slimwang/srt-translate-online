00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,430
In this lesson we will be covering IP

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,740
addressing. In particular we will be covering IPv4

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,226
address structure and allocation. IP stands for Internet

4
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:11,555
Protocol, and version four is the version of the

5
00:00:11,555 --> 00:00:17,283
protocol that is widely deployed on the Internet to date. Each IP address

6
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:22,460
is a 32-bit number. And that 32-bit number is formatted in what is called dotted

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:28,610
quad notation. For example, the IP

8
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:34,770
address for www.cc.tech.edu, is 130.207.7.36. And this

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,705
is just a convenient way of writing a

10
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:40,960
32-bit number. So 130 represents eight bits, and

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,000
207 is another eight bit number. Seven is

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,168
another eight bit number, as is 36. This structure allows for two to the 32 of

13
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:52,050
about 4 billion Internet addresses. Now that sounds

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,730
like a lot of addresses. As it turns

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,250
out it's actually not enough, and we're running out of

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,169
IP addresses, as I'll discuss in a later lesson. But even

17
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:02,050
if we only had to deal with two to the 32

18
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,998
Internet addresses, it's still a lot. Think of it if you

19
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:08,140
have to store every single IP address as an entry

20
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,080
in a table. Very quickly that becomes an extremely large table.

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,770
Where look-ups can be slow and the memory required to store

22
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,290
such a large table might be expensive. So what we need

23
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,390
is a more concise way of representing groups of IP addresses.

24
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,560
There are different ways to group IP addresses and we'll look

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,820
at the prevailing method in the next part of the lesson.

26
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,023
But first, let's look at how this was done before 1994.
