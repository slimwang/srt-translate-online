1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,582
If we now try to summarize what we have so far, we have a pile class and its got

2
00:00:05,582 --> 00:00:10,790
operations. We can put a tree onto the pile. We can get a tree from the pile.

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,450
We can take a tree off of the pile. For the counter we have increment and

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,210
display. And for the tree class we have split and throw away.

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,170
Now, a minute ago we talked about throwing away from the pile,

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,652
and sometimes these things can go back and forth. For the moment we are going to

7
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:33,120
associate with the tree class. In our class model diagram we added a new

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,710
compartment at the bottom of the rectangle to hold the operations. In general,

9
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,480
we could also at this time list of

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,690
various arguments that go arguments to the operations, what their types are,

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:54,070
what is the type of the return value, or we could hold off that process later.

12
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,860
What we are trying to do is get a feel for what the elements of the problem are,

13
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:04,910
and how, how, how they are represented in terms of attributes, and then

14
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,520
what services the various the various classes can have in terms of operations.
