00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,740
I want to start off our discussion,
with a little exercise where we try to

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,330
find an upper bound on
the value of a linear program.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,970
We'll start with this one here, and

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,010
we're going to take a linear combination
of these inequality constraints,

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,600
to obtain an upper bound
on the objective function.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,330
Multiplying the first inequality by y1,
and the second by y2.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,140
And adding them together gives
us this inequality here.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,950
Where I have collected terms.

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,270
Note that it's important
that the y's be non-negative

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,280
to avoid reversing the inequalities.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,678
Note that if we choose y1, and

12
00:00:36,678 --> 00:00:41,138
y2 such that 2 y1- y2 is at least 6.

13
00:00:41,138 --> 00:00:46,864
And also that, y1 + 2 y2, is at least
negative 2, well then this becomes,

14
00:00:46,864 --> 00:00:52,600
an upper bound on the objective
function, for our linear program.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,440
And for the exercise,
I want you to choose y1 and

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,580
y2, to make this bound
as tight as possible.
