1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,460
The layout starts with an opening
tag for a ReativeLayout.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,160
The closing tag is all
the way down here,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,610
and the children XML
elements are in the middle.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,120
The width and

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,735
height of the RelativeLayout
is set to be match_parent.

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,100
Since this is the only layout for

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,120
our app, this is going to take up
the full width and height of the device.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,890
Then we have our first Text View
that says I'm in this corner.

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,480
It's aligned to the parent's bottom and
left edges.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,670
That puts it in the bottom
left corner of the screen.

11
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,142
Going back to the quiz screen,

12
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:33,710
the TextView I'm in this corner is in
the bottom left edge of the screen.

13
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,750
The next TextView says No, up here.

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,670
This is aligned to the parent's top and
left edges.

15
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,730
That puts it in the top
left corner of the screen.

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,590
And indeed, we see that No, up here is
in the top left corner of the screen.

17
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,750
The third TextView says Wait, I'm here.

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,850
This is aligned to the parent's
bottom and right edges.

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,800
This puts it in the bottom
right corner of the parent.

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,530
And we confirm that's it
in the bottom right corner.

21
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,360
For option B to be fully correct,

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,220
the last TextView should be located in
the top right corner of this screen.

23
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,680
And it should say Actually, I'm here.

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,910
And indeed the last
TextView says Actually,

25
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,270
I'm here and it's aligned to
the parent's top and right edges.
