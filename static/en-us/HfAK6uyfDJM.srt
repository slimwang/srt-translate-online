00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,562
Well, if the product is negative then one of the factors must be negative, that

2
00:00:04,562 --> 00:00:08,966
would be this case. If the product is positive then that means that both the

3
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:13,568
factors can be negative, that's this case, but we want to be careful over here.

4
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:18,060
We could have made another number puzzle where the product was positive 45 and

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,492
the sum was positive 14. In this case both of the factors would have been

6
00:00:22,492 --> 00:00:27,015
positive. This case could also be true. So we have to have one negative factor

7
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:31,480
if our product is negative. And we can either have two positive factors or two

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,145
negative factors if our product is positive.
