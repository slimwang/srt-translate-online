00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Male narrator] And the answer is that Breadth - First Search always considers

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
the shortest paths first, and in this case, there's 2 paths of length 1,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and 1, the paths from Arad to Zerind and Arad to Timisoara,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so those would be the 2 paths that would be considered.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now, let's suppose that the tie is broken in some way

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and we chose this path from Arad to Zerind.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Now, we want to expand that node.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We remove it from the frontier and put it in the explored list

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and now we say, "What paths are we going to add?"

10
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So check off the ends of the paths the cities that we're going to add.
