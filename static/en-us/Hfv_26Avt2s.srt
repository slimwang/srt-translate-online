1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,482
We would need to add 4. If we added 4 then we would get a perfect square. We

2
00:00:04,482 --> 00:00:10,758
also know we can add 4 since 1 times 1 would equal 1 square here. We need 4 of

3
00:00:10,758 --> 00:00:15,609
these in total to get our perfect square. This trinomial is a perfect square

4
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:21,088
since we can rewrite it as one. We can rewrite x squared plus 4x plus 4 as the

5
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:27,256
quantity x plus 2 squared. In my head I'm picturing an actual square that has a

6
00:00:27,256 --> 00:00:32,566
side length of x plus 2, and another side length of x plus 2. This is why it's

7
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:37,170
a perfect square. I can also see that my trinomial fits my perfect square

8
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:43,874
pattern. We have a squared plus 2ab plus b squared. This means that we can

9
00:00:43,874 --> 00:00:47,850
rewrite a trinomial, as the quantity of a plus b squared.
