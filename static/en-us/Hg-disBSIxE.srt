1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,846
So, notice that we took our orange circle with the center at 0, 0 and we moved

2
00:00:04,846 --> 00:00:10,322
its center to 20, 0. We also moved the other four points, so we can connect

3
00:00:10,322 --> 00:00:15,763
them to form a new circle that's been shifted 20 units to the right. But what

4
00:00:15,763 --> 00:00:19,738
I'm wondering is what's the equation that would represent this circle? We know

5
00:00:19,738 --> 00:00:23,886
we can't use this equation since it represents the circle centered at the

6
00:00:23,886 --> 00:00:29,316
origin. We also know that this equation cant be right for our new circle since

7
00:00:29,316 --> 00:00:35,660
if we plug in the points 70, 0 into the equation, it doesn't check. The x value

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:41,419
is too large. Keep in mind that this point was at 50, 0 and the y value still

9
00:00:41,419 --> 00:00:48,174
was 0. But the x value changed to 70. Which made this too big, and it made our

10
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:53,324
equation not check. So what I want you to think about is, what would be the

11
00:00:53,324 --> 00:00:58,795
equation for our new circle centered at the point 20, 0? I want you to enter

12
00:00:58,795 --> 00:01:02,606
that equation here. Now I want to acknowledge that this is a really tough

13
00:01:02,606 --> 00:01:07,134
question. You want to think about if the radius changed at all, or if the x

14
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:13,150
values changed or the y values changed. We need to adjust one of them. Which

15
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,679
one do you think we should adjust and by how much? Take some time to think

16
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:19,892
about it, and if you'd like, you can always play around on decimals and enter

17
00:01:19,892 --> 00:01:24,906
your own equations to see how circles move. You're not expected to get

18
00:01:24,906 --> 00:01:27,930
everything right on your first try, you're just expected to think and learn

19
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,410
about math.
