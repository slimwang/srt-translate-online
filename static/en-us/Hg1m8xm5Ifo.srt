00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,350
With the no more tables technique,
below a certain viewport width,

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:08,750
the table is collapsed and resembles
a long list, as opposed to a table data.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,560
The nice thing about this
technique is all of the data is

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,780
visible no matter what
the size of the viewport is.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,570
Let's take a look with
the baseball score again.

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,270
In a wider viewport,
everything looks good,

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,560
but as the viewport shrinks,
the table collapses.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,050
Every column has essentially become its
own row with the table header beside it.

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,370
Using a media query, I need to tell
the table that below a certain width,

10
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:39,290
in this case 500 pixels, I don't
want it to act like a table anymore.

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,690
Inside my media query, I'm going
to force all table, thead, tbody,

12
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,450
th, tr and
td elements to render as display block.

13
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,120
Next, I need to get rid
of the table header.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,470
I could set display none, but that would
cause accessibility problems for people

15
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,630
using screen readers because the browser
won't tell them the column headers.

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,280
Instead, I'm just going to position
the content way off screen.

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,360
Since the table cells are now displayed
as full width block elements, I need to

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,910
add some left padding and also set the
position on these elements to relative.

19
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,630
To add the row labels, I'm going to
use the before pseudo selector and

20
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:26,740
add td before, and inside, I'll set
the position to left: 6 pixels so

21
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,180
that I get it positioned
in the right place.

22
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,190
Now I need to add the content.

23
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,940
I could put the labels in my CSS,
but that's icky and

24
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,650
will mean that these styles
will only work for this table.

25
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,579
Instead, I'll use
content: attr(data-th).

26
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:47,960
That will then pull the values from
the data-th of each of the td elements.

27
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,160
Here, let me show you.

28
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,060
And there you have it.

29
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,270
That data-th is used as the label for
each of the rows.
