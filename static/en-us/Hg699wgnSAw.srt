1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,280
In this lesson, we'll be learning
how to define and call functions.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,270
Apple defines functions,
as self-contained chunks of code,

3
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:09,459
that perform a specific task.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,480
There are three main types of
functions in Swift, Global Functions,

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,919
Nested Functions, and Methods.

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,170
Nested functions,
are slightly more advanced, so

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,210
we're going to focus on Global Functions
and Methods, in this lesson.

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,380
In the Silly Song app, you'll be
using functions to take a name and

9
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:28,079
manipulate its syllable,
to create a song.

10
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:28,819
Let's get started.
