1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,689
Probably the best known example and this
is one of the, the even though SVMs had

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:09,230
started making their way into
computer vision beforehand.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,020
I, I think the one that really sort of
helped put it on the map was this paper

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:19,130
by, this work by Dalal and
Triggs in CVPR 2005 for just doing

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,400
person detection and basically they
were taking upright person detection.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,680
The thing that you need to
know is basically they cut,

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,910
I'm not going to do any more than that,
they cut their pictures up into cells

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:36,110
and they built little histograms of
the oriented gradiance in that cell.

9
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,110
Okay?
So the features were called HoG's.

10
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,170
Histograms of Oriented Gradients,
that's what this HoG's stands for.

11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,070
And then you take one here and
here and here, and

12
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,900
you just stack them up into one great,
big, long feature vector.

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,060
Okay, you just have a great,
big, long, feature vector.

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,140
They took a whole bunch of
windows that somebody had put,

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,820
drawn a little box around and
said, that's a pedestrian.

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,080
Then they took a whole bunch of
other little windows that said,

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,740
not a pedestrian.

18
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,198
They played with rescaling things
etcetera, whatever, training it and

19
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:10,660
basically trained an SVM.

20
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,400
And how well did it work?

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,510
Well obviously relatively well or
I wouldn't be talking to you about this.

22
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:20,275
Here you see, taken from this movie,
the ability to detect people,

23
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:21,872
here's some more of their work.

24
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:24,340
You know, here's a snowstorm.

25
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,990
I suppose it's in England,
but I don't know.

26
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,100
You know, you don't get too much snow.

27
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,620
Here's another example.

28
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,390
And and every now and
then you'll see a false alarm.

29
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,250
Now remember,
it's doing this all instantaneously.

30
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,500
It doesn't remember anything
from the previous image

31
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,530
about there being a person in here.

32
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,750
Here's another example.

33
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,350
I'm not exactly sure why they chose
these examples, but you know, whatever.

34
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,890
Now, you see where it's losing
that person in the background?

35
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,530
One of the problems there was that
there was no gradient between

36
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,260
the side of her dress, and the,
the dark background behind her, so

37
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,540
it sort of failed in
terms of the signal.

38
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,330
And here you can see, you know, pulling,
pulling out some things and not others.

39
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,270
A, a lot of work has been done
to improve this kind of stuff

40
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:06,880
going forward.

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,340
Pedestrian detection has become
a big deal in computer vision.

42
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,280
Partially because we have databases
to train on and to test on, so

43
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,585
you can compare your
results to somebody else's.
