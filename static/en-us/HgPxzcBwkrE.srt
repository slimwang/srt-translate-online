Hey again.

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:05,440
So it turns out that JP might not have
been that crazy when he asked for

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,930
offline access.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,790
So I have been getting some complaints
from some of our users about erratic

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,480
behavior in shopping marts.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,190
In some stores, for whatever reason,
when they don't have internet access

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,250
a user will make changes at then
the next time they open up the app,

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,200
those changes won't be recorded.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,750
Could you maybe look into fixing this?
