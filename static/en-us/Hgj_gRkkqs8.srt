1
00:00:00,255 --> 00:00:05,090
We're going to briefly explore various modeling techniques.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,590
But to be able to build any type of model,

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,600
we will need to first investigate the data.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,560
We will be following the same iterative process of writing down our questions,

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,600
selecting features from the data that can best answer the questions,

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,300
build models to get some answers, and using

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:32,090
validation techniques to determine the model that best answer the questions.

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,720
Although we'll emphasize the process of model building,

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,920
we will still keep iterating through the Q,

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,630
M, V process, and use our diagrams to track our progress.

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,140
Before we dive into a particular example problem,

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:54,460
let's look at various approaches and techniques that we can use to build models.

13
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,010
Let's look at some of the modeling techniques in use.

14
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,999
One of the first techniques that comes to mind is mathematical models.

15
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:09,910
They're usually useful in domains such as natural, social or economic sciences.

16
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,930
The tools and concepts required to build mathematical models

17
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,780
involve differential and integral calculus,

18
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,270
differential equations, algebra, and other advanced mathematics.

19
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,710
The advantages of mathematical models is that they

20
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,700
can give generalized knowledge of systems.

21
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:38,330
They also reduce complex phenomenon to simple cases, and we can use inductive

22
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:44,990
and deductive reasoning to gain knowledge about our system and the models.

23
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,170
Another important technique of model building is statistical or

24
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,820
machine learning.

25
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,730
They are applicable in industry, in businesses, and

26
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:59,470
in general cases where we don't have domain-specific knowledge.

27
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,370
The tools and concepts required for

28
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,940
statistical machine learning models is a good knowledge of statistics,

29
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,440
machine learning, linear algebra, and some information theory.

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,210
The advantage of these models is that we can treat phenomenon in all its

31
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:21,200
complexity, and we can make inferences using computational power.

32
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:28,200
In practice, we often use a combination of mathematical modeling techniques and

33
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,820
statistical and machine-learning techniques.

34
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,500
These are applicable everywhere in science, as we mentioned, social and

35
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,780
economic sciences, business, engineering, as well as optimization problems.

36
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,780
All the tools and

37
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,650
concepts listed above can come in very useful to build these combination models.

38
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:55,550
The advantage is that we can use whatever model we find necessary and

39
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,930
as per requirement to solve our problems.

40
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,660
Hopefully, this table here gives you

41
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:08,210
a general idea of where we use what sort of modeling technique.

42
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,540
Although we're not going to cover mathematical models,

43
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,860
we invite you to go through the tools and concepts required, and

44
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,730
approach some problem with mathematical models if need be.
