00:00:00,295 --> 00:00:05,129
Firebase notifications is a tool to
send targeted notifications in your app.

2
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:07,203
Built on Firebased cloud messaging,

3
00:00:07,203 --> 00:00:11,422
Firebase notifications let you
send notifications to your users.

4
00:00:11,422 --> 00:00:15,260
Configuring Firebase notifications
requires little code to get started and

5
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:19,589
primarily uses the Firebase console
to handle sending messages.

6
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:22,960
You can send a notification to
all users, a group of users or

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,660
even a single user.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,800
You can even use analytics to
determine which group of users

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,929
should be sent notifications.

10
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:34,090
For example, he may want to target only
users who have made in App purchase.

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,550
That way, you can send him a
notification about maybe a special offer

12
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:40,419
and encourage more in App purchases and
user engagement.

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,730
You could then check analytics to
determine how the notification

14
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:45,579
affected user engagement.

15
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:49,629
Analytics automatically records when
a notification is in the foreground,

16
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,150
when it's received, when it is
opened and when it's been dismissed.

17
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:57,390
And this provides you engagement data
on notifications you send to users.

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,890
As you can see, notifications and

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,600
analytics go hand in hand
to boost user engagement.
