1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,578
Values of x that are less than negative 4 do satisfy this inequality. Values of

2
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:09,051
x that lie between negative 4 and 4 do not and values of x that are greater than

3
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:13,323
4 do satisfy it. For this far left inevitable/g we could pick a number like

4
00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:17,971
negative 5. We plug that in to the left side at this inequality. We get negative

5
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:22,507
5 squared which is 25. Then we compare it to the right side and yes 25 is

6
00:00:22,507 --> 00:00:27,522
greater than 16. Between negative 4 and 4, my favorite number would be 0. 0

7
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:32,179
squared is just equal to 0. But 0 is less than 16. So the numbers in this

8
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:37,609
interval don't satisfy this inequality. Lastly, over on the right, I'll pick 5.

9
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:42,395
5 squared is 25, which is, in fact, greater than 16, like we saw before.
