00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,040
I asked my first Android question on Stack Overflow, on August 25, 2008.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,080
Was about a problem I was having on the 0.9 Android Beta SDK.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,250
Android has evolved quickly since then, and

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,560
no where is there more power than here, in the Android Dessert Sculpture garden,

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,150
at the very heart of Android, building 44 at Google HQ.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,580
More than just a convenient place to take a photo with a life-size sculpture of

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:30,400
your favorite dessert, it also tells the history of Android. In terms of food,

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,850
every Android launch has two things in common. Work from work, Bacon Sundays,

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,070
and the crunch time leading up to each launch. And a dessert themed code named

10
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:45,106
memorialized forever here, in the Android Dessert Sculpture garden.

11
00:00:45,106 --> 00:00:49,447
[NOISE] Each release brings with it new hardware, APIs, and features for

12
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:53,954
developers to play with. The third major Android release, 1.5 or Cupcake,

13
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:58,162
as it was code named, brought video recording and widgets to the Android SDK,

14
00:00:58,162 --> 00:01:03,580
and the first baked good to our front lawn. Android 1.6 and 2.0 brought with

15
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:08,770
them giant donuts and eclairs as well as support for different screen sizes, and

16
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,670
tracking multiple simultaneous touch points. The biggest challenge for

17
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,940
Android 2.2 was coming up with a baked dessert starting with the letter F.

18
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,400
A challenge we ultimately ignored,

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,900
instead introducing this giant bowl of froyo to the neighborhood.

20
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,125
Along with that, in cloud's device messaging to the platform.

21
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:31,320
[NOISE] That brings us to Android 2.3, and this giant life-size gingerbread man,

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,067
along with system support for barometers, gyroscopes and NFC.

23
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:40,300
Android 3.0 was the Honeycomb release. The first one targeted, specifically for

24
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:46,020
tablets and paving the way for Android 4.0. Android 4,

25
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,460
Ice Cream Sandwich brought phones and tablets back together. It also introduced

26
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,320
Android Beam, and everyone's favorite font, roboto. Android 4.1 Jelly Bean

27
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,240
was the first platform release to feature rich expandable notifications.

28
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,900
It's also the first sculpture to spontaneously combust thanks to a version one

29
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,120
design, that we've since patented as a solar powered pressure cooker. But

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,473
that's another story. [NOISE] Which brings us to the newest member of our team,

31
00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:18,774
Android 4.4, Kit-Kat. With sensor batching, host card emulation and an API for

32
00:02:18,774 --> 00:02:23,750
text messaging. So how do the dessert names get decided? Well ultimately,

33
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,800
the only real rule is sequential lettering. Then it's down to intense lobbying,

34
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,940
threats, bribery and [UNKNOWN] on the ease of spelling, cultural resonance and

35
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,630
statuability of each proposal. Eventually something just sort of sticks.

36
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,810
Even then, we can surprise ourselves. Take a look at the GIT history for

37
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,820
the K release, and you'll see that even KitKat wasn't always KitKat. As for

38
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,670
what comes next, we'll have to wait and

39
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,890
see what the next statue is, before we know for sure.
