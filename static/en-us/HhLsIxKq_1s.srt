1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,920
>> So, here's the quiz. You see on

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,270
the screen this sort of unexplained two little squiggles

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,088
with a bunch of numbers in front, on top of them or under them or near them?

4
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:10,560
>> Yeah I, I assume that's a river and on one bank it's the

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,370
land of the plus ones and the other bank has been infilitrated by plus twos.

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,380
>> That's not what I intended at all but I actually like that enough that I'm

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,100
going to pretend, that that's what I intended. So

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,910
these work out to be sequences of states.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,850
>> Oh, I see now.

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:25,140
>> Okay,

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,140
and rewards that you receive. No, no, no, it's

12
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,440
a riverbank and on one side of the bank, as

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,025
you walk along it, you get a bunch of plus

14
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:32,759
ones. On the other side you get a bunch of

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,920
plus ones and some plus twos. And this just

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,940
goes on forever, okay? And, I'm not going to tell you

17
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,850
what all the rewards are after that except that they,

18
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,950
they look similar to the rewards that you see here.

19
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,130
>> Okay.

20
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,050
>> Plus ones and plus twos, okay? And let's

21
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,020
say the top, the top one, in fact, nothing

22
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,870
but plus ones. And the bottom ones are some

23
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,260
plus ones with maybe some plus twos sprinkled in and

24
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,190
out, but those are really the only options. Okay?

25
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:52,650
>> Yeah.

26
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,340
>> Here's my question to you. So, would you

27
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,940
rather be on the top side of the river

28
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,930
bank, or the bottom side of the river bank?

29
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,520
Okay? You think you know the answer already, don't you.

30
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,110
>> Yeah.

31
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,460
>> Okay, cool. Well then, let's, let's give our listeners

32
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,720
a, a chance to come up with the right answer.
