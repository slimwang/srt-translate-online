1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,318
y will be greater than or equal to 7. We know that the smallest value x can take

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,683
on will be zero, since that's the fewest number of glasses wipers Grant can put

3
00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:12,915
in his suitcase. And if he does pack that minimum number, and we plug zero in

4
00:00:12,927 --> 00:00:17,050
for x right here, this term will equal zero, and y will just equal 7. Every

5
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:21,490
other number that we could plug in for x would be greater than 0, so y would be

6
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:22,297
greater than 7.
