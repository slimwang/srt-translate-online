Here is the first question, I just copied it from a previous program. Here's

2
00:00:03,672 --> 00:00:07,020
the second question. Notice the first one is a, plain old question, the second

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,490
one is a choice question. I'm passing both of them to the presentQuestion

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,305
method. That's just one of those methods, it's down here, and its parameter has

5
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:20,712
type Question. So it's okay to pass a choice question into a question

6
00:00:20,712 --> 00:00:24,410
parameter. You can always convert from the subclass to the super class.
