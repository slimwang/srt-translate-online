00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You now know the basics of dealing with NP-complete problems

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,500
or NP-hard problems if we're talking about an optimization problem.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,000
Designing intelligent algorithms to find an exact solution, or, failing that,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
accepting approximate solutions,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
or even incorporating randomness into the algorithms.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Are those all of the possible ways that you can deal with an NP-complete problem?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Of course not; there are, for example, combinations between approximation

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
algorithms and randomization algorithms.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And, of course, there are also algorithms that you can use

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,500
if you don't demand performance guarantees because the algorithms

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,000
that we have analyzed, have always provided a certain guarantee

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
as to how they would perform.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If you don't require such performance guarantees,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,500
there's an arsenal of other techniques out there, known as heuristics.

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,000
Some concrete examples for that would be evolutionary algorithms, genetic

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
algorithms, simulated annealing, local search, meta-heuristics, and many more.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,500
Be warned, though; just because some other algorithms don't have any

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,000
provable performance guarantees doesn't necessarily mean

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
that they are simpler or easy.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Rather, successful implementations of any technique for an NP-complete problem

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
require a lot of thought.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And I think the general rule here is finding good solutions to hard problems

23
00:01:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
requires a lot of thought no matter what technique you're using.
