Let's take a look at this identity right here. We have log base a of AB is

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:11,940
equal to log base a of A plus log base a of B. Now, is this true in general for

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,406
any base a? And indeed, it is. The formal name of this, is the product

4
00:00:17,406 --> 00:00:21,424
property. And since we know this is a property of logs in general, logs of any

5
00:00:21,424 --> 00:00:26,500
base, we know that it is true for the natural logarithm as well. Put simply,

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,595
the log of a product is the sum of the logs of the numbers that were multiplied

7
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:36,252
to make that product. Let's use this rule, but in reverse to find log base 10

8
00:00:36,252 --> 00:00:41,629
of 2 plus log base 10 of 5. First, simplify this into the log of one number,

9
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:45,809
and then tell me what that's equal to. Please try this without a calculator

10
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,945
first, but definitely feel free to check it to make sure it, that it works with

11
00:00:48,945 --> 00:00:50,922
your calculator.
