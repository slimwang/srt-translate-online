00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:03,437
Since we already found it's asymptotes, I've gone ahead and given you the graph

2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:10,092
of this function. f of x equals 2x minus 3 over x minus 5. We still have,

3
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:14,118
haven't shown how the solution set of the inequality related to this relates to

4
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:19,482
our function. Remember that the inequality we were working with was 2x minus 3

5
00:00:19,482 --> 00:00:24,646
over x minus 5 is greater than 0. What line do you think we need to add to our

6
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:28,156
graph to help us figure out how the solution of this inequality relates to this

7
00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:34,415
function over here? Shall we draw the line x equals 0, y equals 0, x equals 5,

8
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:36,773
or y equals 2?
