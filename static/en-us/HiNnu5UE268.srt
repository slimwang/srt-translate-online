1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,460
At this point, you should be getting
a correctly formatted URL for

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,670
text and lat-long searches.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,039
Let's go ahead and complete
the next steps to make the request.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,660
We'll create a constant for
the shared NSURLSession, and

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,100
then we need to create an NSURLRequest
from our URL that's being created

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,650
by that flickrURLFromParameters method.

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,000
There we go.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,540
After this,

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,760
let's create a data task using NSURL
sessions data task with request method.

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,679
Remember, this method lets us provide
a closer called a completion handler

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,817
that'll be executed when
the task completes.

12
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:45,184
For now let's just print the raw
data if no error occurs,

13
00:00:45,184 --> 00:00:48,910
otherwise let's print some
information about the error.

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,390
And then the last step is to start this
task by calling its resume method.

15
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,709
Now let's make sure everything works.

16
00:01:07,543 --> 00:01:10,481
And we see the raw JSON data's being
printed, and there's no error.

17
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:15,250
That's a good start.
