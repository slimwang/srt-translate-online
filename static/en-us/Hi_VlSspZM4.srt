1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,040
So, I've got some good news and
I've got some bad news.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:04,920
What do you want to hear first?

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,800
Stark as always.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,700
All right, well,
I'll tell you the good news first.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,240
So, the beta testers love the ability
to share with their friends.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,780
You can see that here
Paulter's rating about it.

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,840
Well, as much as Paulter raves.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,660
Bad news is that we've
got a couple of one and

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,510
two star reviews complaining that
they're having trouble finding

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,860
their friends in
the massive user accounts.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,980
Katie here says that she
loves the sharing feature.

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,610
But with over 400 users, she can't
find any of her actual friends.

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,820
I'm thinking maybe the thing to work on
next to deal with some of these issues

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,890
is some sort of auto complete
searching functionality.

15
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,570
And, I'm guessing we could use
of Firebase's query features

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,652
to implement this functionality.

17
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:46,970
I'm going to think about how you
might implement it a little bit more.

18
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,940
But, while you're waiting,
why don't you jump on a call with JP

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,400
to learn a little bit more about
range queries in Firebase.
