00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,310
Here's a very simple threaded program that uses POSIX threads,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,650
or p-threads as the library is also known. We'll discuss POSIX

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,560
threads for the remainder of the lesson, but most of

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,860
the concepts will apply to all thread libraries. The entry point

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,440
for our process is main, as always. And main will

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,940
spawn two new threads, t1 and t2 which will enter at

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,960
the procedures f1 and f2 respectively. That's why we passed the

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,440
function pointer as we create these threads. These functions become like

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,420
the main of our other threads. And as we see,

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,890
these threads are going to print out a message over and

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,160
over that says that they are the better thread. Notice that

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,740
main we have this join method. We'll discuss this a little

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,010
more later, but basically this mean that the thread is

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,500
going to wait for thread one to finish before it goes

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,200
any further. And then join with thread two means that it

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,160
will wait for thread two to finish before going any further.
