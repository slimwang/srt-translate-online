1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,809
So number of opponents moves
would actually do the opposite

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:03,370
of what we want.

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:08,050
It would label words as good where are
opponent has a large number of moves.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,770
When we actually want to isolate
them and prevent them from moving.

5
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:14,934
Number of squares remaining doesn't
reflect the goodness of the board.

6
00:00:14,935 --> 00:00:16,705
It's constantly decreasing
with each move.

7
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:22,155
Number of squares remaining minus number
of my moves would penalize our computer

8
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:26,234
player for boards with more potential
moves, which is counterproductive.

9
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:29,515
Finally, number of my moves minus
the number of opponent moves

10
00:00:29,515 --> 00:00:33,490
is a good potential evaluation
function for isolation.

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,120
It continues to take in account boards
where the current player can make

12
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,009
a larger number of moves, and

13
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:43,099
also penalizes boards where the opponent
can make a large number of moves.
