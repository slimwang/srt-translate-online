00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,568
x plus 10 squared is correct. Great job if you got that one right. If you're a

2
00:00:04,568 --> 00:00:07,304
little stumped, then stay with me and we'll figure this out together. You

3
00:00:07,304 --> 00:00:12,126
might've also put x plus 10 times x plus 10, which is also correct. We have the

4
00:00:12,126 --> 00:00:16,274
same factor listed twice, so we could've just written it as x plus 10 squared.

5
00:00:16,274 --> 00:00:20,282
This expression follows this factoring pattern. The first term is a perfect

6
00:00:20,282 --> 00:00:24,528
square. Since x squared is x squared, and the last term is also a perfect

7
00:00:24,528 --> 00:00:31,703
square. Since 10 squared is 100. So the a is really x, and the b is really 10.

8
00:00:31,703 --> 00:00:37,430
This means that we can rewrite this expression as x squared plus 2 times x times

9
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,834
10 plus 10 squared. We know this perfect square trinomial can be written as a

10
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:47,635
binomial squared. So, we really have x plus 10 squared. Don't worry if you

11
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:50,383
didn't get this first one right, there'll be more to come.
