00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,408
Recall that the z-score is the sample mean minus the population mean divided by

00:00:05,408 --> 00:00:11,934
the standard deviation of this distribution. But the standard deviation is the

00:00:11,934 --> 00:00:16,994
standard error. When we calculate this, we get about 1.89.
