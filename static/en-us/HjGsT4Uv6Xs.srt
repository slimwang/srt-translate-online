00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,266
For the following example, determine where the primary appraisal and the

2
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:08,860
secondary appraisal is. LaShonda did poorly on a quiz and became frustrated.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,870
She had an immediate negative emotional response. However, after thinking more

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,946
carefully about the situation she realized two important things. First, she

5
00:00:17,946 --> 00:00:21,456
realized that it was better to receive a poor grade for just one assignment and

6
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:26,598
not the entire class. Second, she realized she did not appropriately estimate

7
00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:31,168
how much studying would be necessary to do well on the quiz. So she knows that

8
00:00:31,168 --> 00:00:35,488
in the future she needs to allocate more time to studying to do well on her

9
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:40,970
quizzes. Type which part of this example you think is a primary appraisal, and

10
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:46,250
which part of the example is a secondary appraisal, in the respective boxes
