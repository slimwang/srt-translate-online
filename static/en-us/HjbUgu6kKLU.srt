Alright. So here's our cake challenge. One half of a cake was eaten. If 3 10ths

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:08,332
of the remaining half of the cake was eaten, what fraction of the original cake

3
00:00:08,332 --> 00:00:12,680
is left? You're going to need to combine what you've learned so far. Think about

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,908
if you need to add, subtract, multiply or divide. Also think about how much cake

5
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:21,096
you have to start. This is a tough problem. So, take your time and work slowly.

6
00:00:21,096 --> 00:00:25,076
Patient problem solving can often pay off in the end. Make sure your reasoning

7
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:29,074
through each step, and use diagrams to support your reasoning. You can put your

8
00:00:29,074 --> 00:00:30,850
answer in this box here. Good luck.
