The study that showed the critical importance of attachment bonding in social

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:10,240
stimulation and development is the Tiffany Field's 1979 study. She studied

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,750
newborns who were whisked away from their mothers right after they were born.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,078
Either cause they were born prematurely or they were too small or they were at

5
00:00:18,078 --> 00:00:22,359
risk of not surviving. She got permission from a hospital to do an experiment

6
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:27,077
where she has two groups. So, half the babies that were preterm or at risk

7
00:00:27,077 --> 00:00:32,208
received the standard care. And that treatment was removal from mom, and

8
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:36,766
isolated in a germ-free incubator. The other half of the preterm at risk babies

9
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:41,274
received the new treatment. This was 15 minutes of skin to skin touching and

10
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:44,239
stroking from the nurse, every single day.
