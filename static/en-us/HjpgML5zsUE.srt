1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The next thing I'll do is I'll divide it by σ².

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Without telling you why I'm doing this, I want to see what the effect is.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Suppose σ² = 4. That means we have a variance of 4 and a standard deviation of 2.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I've given you already the quadratic function when it isn't divided by σ².

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's the same as saying σ² = 1.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What I'd like to know is whether our new version where σ² = 4

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
makes this quadratic wider or whether it makes it narrower,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
assuming that this is our new function f(x).

9
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, pick one of the two, or perhaps it stays the same. Then pick the third.
