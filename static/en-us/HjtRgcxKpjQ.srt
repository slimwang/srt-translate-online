1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,839
So, as we're learning about gradients now,

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,680
let's spend a minute to kind of review what we know about gradients.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,540
I've basically shown you four sample images here and the question is,

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,110
which of these gradients, for this whole range from zero to 255,

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,720
for four of these images, is the largest in terms of magnitude?

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,400
From this point to that.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,280
So, this is the region.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,030
And we're interested, basically, in which one has the lost,

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,110
largest change as I move from this location to that.

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,540
For examples, all of them are exactly, as I said, starting from zero to 255,

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,840
but if you notice, each one of them in the direction that I'm pointing out,

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,090
does have different changes.

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:48,910
Answer by basically choosing which of the boxes applies to the correct answer.

14
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:49,410
Thank you.
