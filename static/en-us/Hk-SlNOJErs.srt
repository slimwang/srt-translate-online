The specific lesson objectives for this lesson are,

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,580
I'm going to talk a lot more about the concept of focal length, we will and

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,260
then discuss the whole issues of how the field of view of a camera, or

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,170
a imaging sensor are related to focal length.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,220
We will also discuss the importance of, the sensor size for each camera, and

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,590
we will look in detail at the whole image formation pipeline and

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,110
how images are captured and discuss the basics of perspective projection,

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,140
that is important in trying to capturing the 3D aspect of a scene.
