1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,870
To change what our box plots look like, we just need

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,780
to adjust the Y axis. We can use the ylim parameter

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,680
inside of Q plot to do so. Here, I can set

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,850
the upper and lower limits. The lower limit will be 0

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,500
and the upper limit will be 1000. Now, you may or

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,910
may not have gotten a warning message here about removing data

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,900
points. When we use the ylin parameter, we're actually removing data

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,570
points from our calculations. So the original box plots that we have

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,620
might look slightly different from this. Another way to create the

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,280
same plot is to use the scale y continuous layer. So we

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,570
can use this same bit of code here and then just

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,405
close off our parenthesis. Adding the scale_y_continous layer, I can

13
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:41,190
set the limits to be between 0 and 1000. Running this

14
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,460
code, we can see that we get the same exact box plots.

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,025
What I want to draw your attention to, is the female box

16
00:00:47,025 --> 00:00:50,490
plot. Notice how the top of the box is just below 250.

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,280
So this value might be around 200 or 230. But this

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,970
value might not be accurate for all of our data. When we

19
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,610
use the ylim paramater or the scale_y_continuous layer, we actually remove

20
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,580
data points from calculations. So a better way to do this is

21
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,060
to use the cord Cartesian layer to set the y limits

22
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,860
instead. So, we'll use the same bit of code and then instead

23
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,740
of adding scale wide continuous layer, we'll add the cored Cartesian layer.

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,690
And here I'll set the y limits from 0 to a 1000.

25
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,660
Notice how the top of the box has moved slightly closer to

26
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,050
250 for females. I'll explain this difference in more detail in the

27
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:27,090
next video. We'll also discuss what the top of the box means.

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,190
What the bottom of the box means. And what this black line means.
