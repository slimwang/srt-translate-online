00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is the Super Hard Quiz of Doom and our last question on finite state machines

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and regular languages and regular expressions.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This requires quite a bit of abstract thinking so don't feel bad if this takes a number of tries.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
These questions are always, sometimes, and never.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I've written out two claims, and what I want you to do is mark this box if the first claim is always true,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
mark this box if they're sometimes when it's true and sometime when it's false,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and this box if it's never true. So here's the first claim.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Suppose I have any finite state machine A. You draw it out for me.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Can I then make a new finite state machine that accepts strings of the following form?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
For any string that's in yours, I then get another string that's in yours

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and I accept their concatenation when I glue them together.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is a little hard to get a feeling for but let's imagine my finite state machine A accepted

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
ba ba ba, that sort of thing.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Then I want to make a new finite state machine that accepts

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
ba ba, ba ba, ba ba, doublings of the first finite state machine.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Down here, I have a very similar claim but with one bit change.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
If I have a finite state machine B, can I make a new finite state machine that accepts strings

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
of this form--x concatenated with x where x was a string accepted by B?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So if you give me a finite statement machine that only recognizes hello,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
can I make a new finite machine that recognizes hello, hello?

21
00:01:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I don't know why you'd say that. Anyway, give this some thought. This may take some extra time.
