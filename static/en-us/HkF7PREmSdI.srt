1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,298
So now we have our formal measurement for the f statistic. Which signals

2
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:09,852
whether or not there is a significant difference between any two sample means,

3
00:00:09,852 --> 00:00:16,250
out of k samples. We can write this as the sum of squares for between groups.

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,319
Divided by the degrees of freedom for between groups. Divided by the sum of

5
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:25,790
squares for within groups. Divided by the degrees of freedom for within groups.

6
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:32,028
This gives us what we call the mean square. And this ratio is our f statistic.
