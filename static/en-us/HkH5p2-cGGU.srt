00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,980
Note that like in any analysis process, the conclusions that we reach are always

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,550
tentative. As we engage in the process, we learn more about the problem,

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,390
which may lead to revisions of our analysis. In fact, it was one of the early

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:18,030
lessons of software engineering, is that requirements documents are always wrong

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,010
in the sense that they're incomplete, or inconsistent, or they don't truly

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,690
reflect what it is that the customer ultimately wants. And as an analyst it's

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:32,380
your job to elicit that correct description. And OOA can help you do that.

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,860
Questions that arise during OOA may require research on your part,

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,290
or even going back to the customers. Often, the customers may not have even

10
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:47,240
considered, what you, what you bring up as a question. And will thank you for

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,190
realizing that there was more to the problem than what they originally had in my

12
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:56,630
mind. Thus, the overall process of analysis is inherently incremental,

13
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,760
hopefully leading to a joint understanding between the analyst and

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,240
customer so that the design and implementation can proceed
