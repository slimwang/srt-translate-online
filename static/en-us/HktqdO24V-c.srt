1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,880
So far, we have talked about the case where there was an error in

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,960
the knowledge or an error in the reasoning or in the learning. The knowledge for

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,080
example was incorrect in some way but the knowledge can also be incomplete.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,239
There can be a gap in knowledge or in reasoning or in learning. A gap in

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,380
knowledge occur when we're doing this exercise under explanation-based learning.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,580
In that particular case, the agent had build this part of the explanation, and

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,440
it also had this part of the explanation. But it could not connect these two,

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,600
because there was no knowledge to connect that are object that has thick

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,120
sides and it can limit heat transfer that it would protect against heat.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,210
Once the agent detects this as a knowledge gap,

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,310
then it can set up a learning goal. The learning goal now,

12
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,430
is, acquire some knowledge that will connect these two pieces of knowledge.

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,010
Once the agent detects a knowledge gap, it can set up a learning goal.

14
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,670
The learning goal now is to be able to connect these two pieces of information.

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,340
Notice that we are seeing how agents can spawn goals.

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,930
In this particular case the agent is spawning a learning goal.

17
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,170
You might recall that when we did this exercise on explanation based learning,

18
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,480
the agent went back to its memory, and found a precedent, found a piece of

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,260
knowledge, that enabled it to connect these two parts of the explanation. And so

20
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,700
this link was formed and the agent was then able to complete its explanation.

21
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,390
This is an example how the learning goal was satisfied, using some piece of

22
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,870
knowledge. In this case the knowledge came from the memory. But the agent could

23
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,720
have potentially also acquired the knowledge from the external world.

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,730
For example, it may have gone to a teacher and said, I have a learning goal.

25
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,870
Help me with the knowledge that will satisfy that learning goal.

26
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,670
Its ability to spot learning goals and then find ways of satisfying or achieving

27
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,910
those learning goals or any goal in general, is another aspect of metacognition.

28
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,750
So this was an example of how metacognition helps resolve a gap in knowledge.

29
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,040
Now let us see how it can help resolve gaps in reasoning or

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,170
learning. To see how metacognition can help resolve reasoning gaps,

31
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,350
let us return to this example of using mean sense analysis in

32
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,110
the blocks micro build. Once the agent reaches a cul de sac in the reasoning.

33
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,508
The agent could formally list its goal and ask itself how can I help to

34
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:12,320
resolve this cul-de-sac. It may then be the reminder of this strategy problem

35
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,330
reduction was it uses its goals into several independent goals and

36
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,680
then the agent can go about achieving each goal at one at a time. Thus in this

37
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,700
example, the agent set up a new reasoning goal and that used that reasoning goal

38
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,900
to pick a different strategy and thereby achieved that reasoning goal.

39
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,280
Note also that this is one way in which we can integrate multiple strategies. We

40
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,620
first use some [x] analysis right in the cul-de-sac, form a new listening goal,

41
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,350
use the listening goal to bring in a different strategy follow reduction and

42
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,410
then go back to the original strategy means and

43
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,670
analysis. We're achieving each goal independently
