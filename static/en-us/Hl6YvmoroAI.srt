1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,950
So here's a solution to the exercise.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:07,000
As you can see,
each pet was made a row of the table.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,090
And each column represents
an attribute of the pet.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,530
All right, so
that checks off number one.

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,350
Let's move through
the rest of the questions.

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,680
So for the second question,
how many rows will we have,

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,780
excluding the column header row?

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,910
Well that'd be three.

9
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,860
The three represents the three pets, or
three objects that we have in our table.

10
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,980
And next, how many columns
does the spreadsheet have?

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,550
Well, it would have four.

12
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,880
Each pet will have four
different attributes.

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,740
So it could have a name,
a gender, a weight, and a breed.

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,990
So last question is, which one of
these could be a column header?

15
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,340
So like I just mentioned,

16
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,140
weight was one of the attributes that
each of these objects will have.

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,850
All right, so good job on the exercise.

18
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,230
Knowing this information
is a great way for

19
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,580
us to begin structuring the data so that
we can begin building out the Pets app.

20
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,470
So see you in the next video.
