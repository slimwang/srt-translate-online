1
00:00:00,321 --> 00:00:03,678
So in this unit and the one before, we looked into

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,190
how to model forces and acceleration and how to

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,942
come up with a reasonably good numerical

4
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:13,037
solution of a differential equation. This knowledge

5
00:00:13,037 --> 00:00:15,402
is of course something that you can apply in all

6
00:00:15,402 --> 00:00:19,551
situations in which velocities and forces and

7
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:22,688
acceleration play a major role. We are going to

8
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:25,904
apply it in a later unit to design an anti-lock

9
00:00:25,904 --> 00:00:28,604
breaking system. But differential equations can do

10
00:00:28,604 --> 00:00:32,670
much more than just describe vehicles. In the next

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,308
unit, we will look at the spread of contagious

12
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:38,689
diseases for instance by modeling a population as

13
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:41,392
consisting of susceptible, infectious

14
00:00:41,392 --> 00:00:43,000
and recovered persons.
