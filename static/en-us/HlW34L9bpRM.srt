00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,424
In this case, we would want u to equal 4m minus 3. Great thinking if you found

2
00:00:05,424 --> 00:00:09,296
it. In general, when we choose u for u substitution, we want u to equal the

3
00:00:09,296 --> 00:00:15,096
repeated expression in the equation. Notice that the 4m minus 3 is a repeated

4
00:00:15,096 --> 00:00:19,610
expression. We have it squared, and then we have it raised to the 1 power.
