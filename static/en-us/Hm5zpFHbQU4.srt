00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,732
Well, I'd certainly check car and person. Those are nouns, they're current in

2
00:00:05,732 --> 00:00:11,970
the problem description. drive is a verb, so that probably wouldn't work out.

3
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,721
And now car sharing, yes it is a noun, but how would a car sharing class help

4
00:00:17,721 --> 00:00:24,052
us? What would an object of class carsharing look like? So, that's not so

5
00:00:24,052 --> 00:00:29,844
clear. So, this is just a technique to give us some candidates for classes, so

6
00:00:29,844 --> 00:00:35,377
that one can get started designing a solution. It's not perfect but it's pretty

7
00:00:35,377 --> 00:00:39,555
useful. Now, I want to shift focus a bit and talk about the challenges of

8
00:00:39,555 --> 00:00:42,230
implementing a single class.
