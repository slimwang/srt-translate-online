1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's think of a simple answer first.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Suppose I want to send a message to Alice.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
If I want confidentiality, I can put that in an envelope, seal the envelope,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and write that it's for Alice.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
To make sure my seal is good, I'll make sure that no one else can open this.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I could give the message to Alice.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Now, the problem is if Bob is jealous and the mere fact

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that I'm communicating with Alice would cause problems

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I can't just hand the message to Alice. That would show that we're communicating.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What I'm going to do instead is use Coleen.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm going to give the message to Coleen and ask Colleen to give the message to Alice.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I will have a new envelope. I'll give this to Coleen.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What I'll put in that envelope is the message I want to give to Alice.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This also has a very secure seal, so no one else will open the message,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and I give it to Coleen.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If someone sees me giving a message to Coleen, well, there's no problem there.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Coleen would open the message and see that it's got a message to give to Alice.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Then she could give the message to Alice.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This works a little bit, and Coleen could open the message and give it to Alice.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How well does this scheme work?

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The question is which of these properties are necessary

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
for this scheme that I just described to successfully hide the fact

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
that I'm communicating with Alice?

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Requires complete trust in Coleen?

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It require that Bob cannot see when I talk with Coleen?

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It requires that Bob must not be able to see when Coleen talks with Alice?

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It requires that Bob must not be able to see both communications

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
when I talk with Coleen and when Coleen talks with Alice?
