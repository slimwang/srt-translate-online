At an elementary school, there are a lot of students for which Spanish is their

2
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:09,513
first language. Now let's say there are two ways of teaching English to them.

3
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:14,335
One way is to only teach them in English. Another way is to teach them in both

4
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:19,283
English and Spanish. So researchers randomly assigned students to one of these

5
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:24,844
two groups. One student were assigned to either being taught in English only or

6
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:29,989
in both Spanish and English, it stayed that way. After a while, the researchers

7
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:35,036
gave each student a reading comprehension test. On the day of testing for the

8
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:40,105
English only group, the temperature was 72 degrees Fahrenheit. But for the

9
00:00:40,117 --> 00:00:45,870
bilingual group the temperature was 100 degrees Fahrenheit, which is pretty hot.

10
00:00:45,987 --> 00:00:51,365
When the scores were calculated, the English only group had an average of 70%,

11
00:00:51,482 --> 00:00:54,815
while the bilingual group had an average of 55%.
