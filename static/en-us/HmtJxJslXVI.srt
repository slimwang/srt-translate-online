1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,280
We're now moving on to cover interdomain

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,610
routing or routing between ASes. Recall that internet

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,430
routing consists of routing between tens of

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,850
thousands of independently operated networks, or autonomous systems.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,309
Each of these networks operate in their

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,050
own self-interest, and have independent economic and performance

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,940
objectives, and yet they must cooperate to provide

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,110
global connectivity so that when you're sitting at

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,570
home, you can retrieve content that might

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,890
be hosted at the Georgia Tech network. Now,

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,920
each independently operated network is called an autonomous

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,290
system, or AS. And each AS advertises reachability

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,710
to some destination by sending what are

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,920
called route advertisements or announcements. The protocol that

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,740
ASes use to exchange these route advertisements is

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,160
called the Border Gateway Protocol, or simply, BGP.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,390
A route advertisement has many important attributes, but

18
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,400
for now, let's just talk about three. Now a

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,020
router here, let's say on the Comcast network, might

20
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,280
receive a route advertisement, typically from its neighboring AS.

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,830
That route advertisement might contain a destination prefix,

22
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,410
such as the IP prefix for Georgia Tech. Then

23
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,820
it might contain what's called a next hop IP

24
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,790
address, which is the IP address of the router

25
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,380
that Comcast router must send traffic to, to send

26
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,140
traffic along that route. Typically that next hop IP address

27
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,620
is the IP address for the first router in

28
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,400
the neighboring network. And Comcast router knows how to reach

29
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,580
that next hop IP address because its border router

30
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,320
and the border router in the neighboring AS are on

31
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,570
the same subnet. Typically this might be a /30

32
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,650
subnet, therefore this IP address is reachable from Comcast's border.

33
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,390
A third important attribute is whats called the

34
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,019
AS path which is a sequence of what are

35
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,310
called AS numbers, that describe the route to

36
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,768
the destination. Now strictly speaking, the AS path is

37
00:01:52,768 --> 00:01:57,745
nothing more than the sequence of ASes that the route traversed to reach the

38
00:01:57,745 --> 00:02:02,660
recipient AS. So for example, Georgia Tech's AS number is

39
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:08,096
2637 and Abilene's is 10578. So the AS path that Comcast

40
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:11,576
would hear if it received a route advertisement

41
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:15,404
from Abilene for Georgia Tech, would be 10578

42
00:02:15,404 --> 00:02:18,249
followed by 2637. So in the remainder of

43
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:20,289
the lesson we'll look at other BGP route

44
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:23,449
attributes. But these are essentially the three most

45
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:26,786
important because they describe how to stitch together

46
00:02:26,786 --> 00:02:30,020
an interdomain path to a global destination. So

47
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,500
we have the destination IP prefix for the destination

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,720
that a router might want to send traffic to. The

49
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,080
next hop, which is the IP address for the router

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,890
for the next hop along the path. And finally,

51
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,860
the AS path, which is the sequence of ASes that

52
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,260
the route traversed en route to the AS that's

53
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,830
hearing the announcement. The last AS number on the AS

54
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,370
path is often called the origin AS, because that is

55
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,950
the AS that originated the advertisement for this IP prefix.

56
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:04,020
In this case, the origin AS is 2637, or Georgia Tech,

57
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,160
because it is the AS that originated the announcement for this prefix.
