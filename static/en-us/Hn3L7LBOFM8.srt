1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
The next type of partnerships might be joint business development,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,220
joint promotion of complimentary products.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:12,610
One might be the dominant player. The best example of this in the computer industry was Intel.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:20,390
Now, historically, chips ended up to be inside the computer that the consumer never saw at all,

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,640
and in fact, the only name on the outside of the box was the manufacturer,

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,250
but Intel in 1980s changed that game.

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:36,130
They said what if we pay PC manufacturers to put the phrase Intel Inside on the outside of the box,

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,660
and what used to be just this unknown piece of silicone inside the computer

9
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,890
actually became a valuable brand for joint business development,

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,570
joint promotion by sharing advertising dollars and sales programs.
