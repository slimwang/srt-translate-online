00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,766
Now we're going to talk about how to do inference on Bays Net.

2
00:00:03,767 --> 00:00:14,366
We'll start with our familiar network, and we'll talk about a method called enumeration, which goes through all the possibilities,

3
00:00:14,367 --> 00:00:23,999
adds them up, and comes up with an answer. So what we do is start by stating the problem.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,066
We're going to ask the question of, "What is the probability that the burglar alarm occurred, given that John called and Mary called?"

5
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:47,132
We'll use the definition of conditional probability to answer this. So this query is equal to the joint probability distribution

6
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:55,266
of all three variables, divided by the conditionalized variables.

7
00:00:55,267 --> 00:01:03,199
Now, note I'm using a notation here where, instead of writing out the probability of some variable equals true,

8
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,632
I'm just using the notation, "Plus," and then the variable name in lowercase.

9
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:13,566
And if I wanted the negation, I would use negation sign.

10
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:21,299
Notice there's a different notation where, instead of writing out the plus and negation signs, we just use the variable name itself,

11
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:31,899
P of E, to indicate E is true. That notation works well, but it can get confusing between, "Does P of E mean E is true,

12
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:41,099
"or does it mean E is a variable?" And so we're going to stick to the notation where we explicitly have the pluses and negation signs.

13
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:49,566
To do inference by enumeration, we first take a conditional probability and rewrite it as unconditional probabilities.

14
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:56,166
Now we enumerate all the atomic probabilities and calculate the sum of products.

15
00:01:56,167 --> 00:02:05,632
Let's look at just the complex term on the numerator first. The procedure for figuring out the denominator would be similar, and we'll skip that.

16
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:17,732
So, the probability of these three terms together can be determined by enumerating all possible values of the hidden variables.

17
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:29,732
In this case there are two--E and A. So we'll sum over those variables for all values of E, and for all values of A--

18
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:34,166
In this case they're Boolean, so there's only two values of each.

19
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:41,299
We ask, "What's the probability of this unconditional term?"

20
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:49,132
And that we get by summing out over all possibilities, E and A being true or false.

21
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:55,966
Now, to get the values of these atomic events, we'll have to rewrite this equation in a form that corresponds to the

22
00:02:55,967 --> 00:03:03,832
conditional probability tables that we have associated with the Bays net. So we'll take this whole expression and rewrite it.

23
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:15,232
It's still a sum over the hidden variables, E and A. But now I'll rewrite this expression in terms of the parents of each of the nodes in the network.

24
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:25,032
So that gives us the product of these five terms, which we then have to sum over all values of E and A.

25
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:43,132
If we call this product F of EA, then the whole answer is the sum of f for all values of E and A.

26
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:51,532
So it's the sum of four terms, where each of the terms is a product of five numbers.

27
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:57,999
Where do we get the numbers to fill in this equation? From the conditional probability tables from our model.

28
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:10,099
So let's put the equation back up, and we'll ask you for the case where both E and A are positive, two look up in the

29
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:24,933
conditional probability tables, and fill in the numbers for each of these five terms, and then multiply them together and fill in the product.
