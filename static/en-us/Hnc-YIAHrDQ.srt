1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,200
That was cool.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,310
Picture, tell me what's in the picture.

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,980
But those labels, you notice, those were all about sort of,

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,150
static objects that were present in a single image.

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,520
These days, especially with sort of the ubiquity of media,

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,270
computer vision is not limited to just processing a single image.

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,520
In fact, we can process a whole bunch of images such as a video.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,740
And video allows us to start talking about thinks like action.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,940
So to illustrate that, let's call back on Arpan again.

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,790
Arpan, come on over.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,323
All right, Arpan, do your thing.

12
00:00:33,176 --> 00:00:35,700
So, here's a quick quiz, what did Arpan just do?
