00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,340
In the first iteration of GIFMaker,
you may have noticed this create and

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,770
save button on the preview screen.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,200
In this next iteration, we want that
button to do something, namely save and

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,730
persist GIFs.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,150
Here's what the new flow will look like.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,140
The app opens up to the welcome view
the first time a user opens the app.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,490
But from then on it opens up to
the saved gifts collection view.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,760
With the saved GIFs collection
view as our root view controller,

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,860
we follow a flow similar to the first
iteration until we get to the preview

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,200
screen, where now the user
is able to save a GIF.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,920
Once a GIF has been saved,
it's added to this collection view.

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,630
Eventually you can build up
a collection and persist the GIFs,

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,130
such that when we close and relaunch
the app, our GIFs are still there.
