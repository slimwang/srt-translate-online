00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,840
As far as icon are concerned, state chart compromise between the rectangles that

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,019
we saw in the ovals to a thing called round-tangles, rounded cornered

3
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:16,140
rectangles. They can, they can have labels indicating state name.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,295
They can have arcs connecting them which is a,

5
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:23,088
a directed arc that is there's going to be an arrowhead at one end.

6
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:28,490
And the arch's themselves can be labeled with the event causing the transition,

7
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,470
possibly with a slash and the action taken when the the event occurs.

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:38,400
Also, there's a way to indicate what the default or initial state is.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,790
In the case of state charts this is having a small circle that's filled in.

10
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,580
You know blackened. And the final state in this case, the final state is one in

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:55,030
which there is a concentric outer ring around a filled in a filled in circle.
