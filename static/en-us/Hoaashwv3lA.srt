1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,410
If you draw a vertical line on the same coordinate plan as a function, and the

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,203
functions curve should only intersect that line 1 or fewer times. Let's pretend

3
00:00:09,203 --> 00:00:13,557
for a second that this pencil is a vertical line. Now saying that a functions

4
00:00:13,557 --> 00:00:18,045
curve should intersect this vertical line 1 or fewer times, is exactly the same

5
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:22,244
as saying that each x value should have only 1 y value associated with it.

6
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:26,798
Remember, just like line A over here, and like this pencil now any vertical line

7
00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:31,172
has an equation that can be written in the form, X equals some number. 4 in the

8
00:00:31,172 --> 00:00:35,354
case of line A right here. This means that every single point along this line

9
00:00:35,354 --> 00:00:39,681
will have the same x coordinate. It also means that if another curve intersects

10
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:43,581
a vertical line at more than spot, and there's more than one point on that

11
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:47,542
curve, that has the x coordinate of the vertical line. So even if we drew

12
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:52,005
something like this. A little bit messy but you get the picture. This blue curve

13
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:56,257
is not a function. Why is it not a function? Because if we move our pencil to,

14
00:00:56,257 --> 00:01:00,283
actually a tiny different positions along the x axis, this curve would cross to

15
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:04,084
the pencil in more than one spot. That means that for a given input, a given x

16
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:07,867
coordinate, you might either end up with one y coordinate, or a different y

17
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:12,035
coordinate. So vertical lines and other functions that don't pass this test over

18
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:15,769
here, don't work the same way that the candy machine does. If we had a candy

19
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:19,609
machine that worked like this, for multiple values of amount of money you put

20
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:22,305
in, you could end up with different amounts of candy.
