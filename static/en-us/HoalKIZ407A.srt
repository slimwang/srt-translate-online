1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here's the only place where quotes are handled. Tag is always false.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This condition: if we see a quote and tag, then only we should go into quote mode,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
it should actually never hold. But maybe there's something wrong with this condition.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So let's come up with the new hypothesis.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A new hypothesis is the error is due to the quote condition evaluating to true.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's come up with an experiment to verify this hypothesis.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If this condition evaluates to true, then the next line should be executed.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So what we do is, we simply write an assert false in here,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
meaning that the assertion should now automatically fail, if this ever gets executed.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So this piece of code should actually never be reached when executing the program.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Our expectation this time is, with this input, this assertion should fail.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Again, we make this quiz: after we inserted assert false,

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
does the program now raise an exception meaning that the quote condition holds,

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and therefore, something's wrong with that condition

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
or is the output still foo, that is the input with the quote strip,

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and then the quote condition obviously does not hold because the assert false is never reached?

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Try this out for yourself.
