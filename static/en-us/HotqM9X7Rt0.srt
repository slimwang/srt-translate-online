00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,340
So if we're considering something
that looks very similar to our paper

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,140
prototype why would make one?

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,310
For this, it's important to go back
to the idea of circles of feedback.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,940
Our paper prototype was a thing that we
could show to people who were near by

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,440
and who we knew.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,200
The medium fidelity prototype will be
something we can show to subject matter

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,648
experts and users as well.

8
00:00:20,648 --> 00:00:24,290
By expanding our net we can gather more
information on the apps experience from

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,520
each of these vital perspectives.

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,530
With an interactive prototype we
can ask users to complete tasks and

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,330
see how they go about doing it.

12
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,270
We can ask them to explore the app
looking for a certain functionality.

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,900
And most importantly we can
get out of their way and

14
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,600
see the raw reaction to the app.
