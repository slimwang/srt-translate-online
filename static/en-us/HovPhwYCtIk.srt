1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,957
So, let's go back to the code we have for extracting the first URL in a page

2
00:00:03,957 --> 00:00:07,324
and see how we can turn that into a procedure.

3
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:10,561
And remember, we made many copies of the same code

4
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:13,803
if we wanted to extract many links from the page.

5
00:00:13,803 --> 00:00:16,931
What we want to do now is take the part that we kept having to copy

6
00:00:16,931 --> 00:00:20,884
and figure out how to turn that into a procedure.

7
00:00:20,884 --> 00:00:23,346
What we want to do is take this code--

8
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:26,539
we're going to take all the code here--

9
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:29,378
I'm leaving this part out of the procedure,

10
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:32,509
because that's what we want to do with the results--

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,388
what we want to do is take all this code

12
00:00:34,388 --> 00:00:36,224
and turn it into a procedure.

13
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:39,392
That means, instead of having to do all this work each time,

14
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:40,926
what we want is a procedure

15
00:00:40,926 --> 00:00:42,309
that will start from what we have here--

16
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,651
we have the "page."

17
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:45,236
What we want to do is from the "page,"

18
00:00:45,236 --> 00:00:48,334
do a bunch of work; get the URL.

19
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:50,732
Then, we want to do some stuff with the URL,

20
00:00:50,732 --> 00:00:52,445
want to do some stuff with the page,

21
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:54,288
and then we're going to do it all over again.

22
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:57,918
Our goal is to figure out how to turn this part of the code into a procedure,

23
00:00:57,918 --> 00:01:01,078
so we could keep reusing that, each time,

24
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:04,616
instead of writing the same code.

25
00:01:04,616 --> 00:01:07,836
We need a little more room, so let's shrink the code we had.

26
00:01:07,836 --> 00:01:10,685
Now the question is, how are we going to make that procedure?

27
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:12,728
Let's start with a quiz:

28
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:14,917
When we think about making a procedure,

29
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:17,957
the first thing we always want to do is make sure that we understand this:

30
00:01:17,957 --> 00:01:20,301
we need to know what the inputs are to that procedure;

31
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:22,048
we need to know what the outputs are.

32
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,474
If we don't understand the inputs and outputs,

33
00:01:24,474 --> 00:01:26,897
then there's no hope of writing the procedure correctly

34
00:01:26,897 --> 00:01:28,271
since the main purpose of the procedure

35
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:30,899
is to map the inputs into the outputs.

36
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:33,278
Let's see if you can figure out what the inputs should be

37
00:01:33,278 --> 00:01:36,723
for the procedure that we want to make to replace this code.

38
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:40,286
I'm going to give the procedure a name.

39
00:01:40,286 --> 00:01:42,421
The goal of the procedure is to find the URL

40
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:45,257
that's the next link target in this page,

41
00:01:45,257 --> 00:01:48,006
so we'll call the procedure, "get_next_target"--

42
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:50,202
it's important to give good names to procedures;

43
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:52,580
that's how we remember what they're supposed to do--

44
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,105
and we'll use the name "get_next_target."

45
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:57,358
So, our question now is, in defining this procedure,

46
00:01:57,358 --> 00:01:59,734
what should its inputs be?

47
00:01:59,734 --> 00:02:01,505
I'll give you some choices:

48
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:05,956
its input could be a number giving the position of the start of the next link;

49
00:02:05,956 --> 00:02:10,482
its input could be a number giving the position of the start of the next quote;

50
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:14,270
its input could be a string giving the contents of the rest of the web page;

51
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,133
and, for the final choice, we could have two inputs--

52
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:20,486
the first, a number giving the position of the start of the next link,

53
00:02:20,486 --> 00:07:26,000
and the second, a string giving the contents of the page.
