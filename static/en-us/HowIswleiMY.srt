00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, for the answers. A theory is the outcome of the scientific method.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
A theory is also particularly useful hypothesis

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
because we refined the hypothesis until it becomes a theory.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And it also is a framework that explains and predicts observations.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is the official definition of theory.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A theory, however, is not a vague guess

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
when you're talking about the scientific meaning of this theory

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
When you have scientist speaking about theory, they're talking about the framework

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that is consistent with all earlier observation and predicts lots and lots of future observations

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and its actually the best framework in most cases

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
When you have layman speaking about theory, it's more like I have this theory

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
on how things could be which does not necessarily have the same strength as scientific theory.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The misunderstanding between theory in the sense of a layman using it

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and with the theory as scientist use it is the cause for lots of confusion in political debates.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Think about the theory of evolution.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
For scientist, the theory of evolution is exactly exponential

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and prediction of lots and lots of observations.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
A very consistent and form many beautiful framework.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
For others, oh this is just a theory of evolution disseminating this as vague guess.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Be careful when you heard the word theory. Its meaning depends very much on whoever says it.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In our context, of course, we're using a theory in order to explain

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
what the cause of a failure is and in our context we're not looking for vague guesses,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
we're looking for something that explains all earlier observations and predicts the future one.
