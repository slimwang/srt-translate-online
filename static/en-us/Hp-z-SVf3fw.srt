1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right. Let's play with some of these substitutions, in practice.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
All right, here we are, back in that simple text file--

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
the play HTML file I was playing with before--

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and we're going to use this because it's a little bit quicker

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to demonstrate what I'd like to talk about.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So I'm going to enter some text.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So I've typed in some text; I Save it this and I load this in my browser.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay. So here we are; I've loaded this text in my browser

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and, if you remember--if I just type in plain text in an HTML file,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
it just shows up as plain text in the browser.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay. Now I'm going to surround this tag with angled brackets

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and let's see how this renders in our browser.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
When I Reload my browser,

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that word, html, disappeared.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's because, when I put angled brackets around it,

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
it turned into a tag, and tags don't render an HTML.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
They turn into tags.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So if we use the Escaping we just learned

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and I replace this Less Than symbol with our Escape,

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
which is: <

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and I replace the Greater Than with: >

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and I Reload this in my browser, what we see is

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the actual text that we wanted to demonstrate--

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
which is the actual angled brackets.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So let's try another quick example of this.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If I were to change the string, html,

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
to the letter, "b",

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and Save this and Reload this in my browser,

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
we now have the <b>tag.</b>

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And if I were to go back to my Editor and change

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
these Less Than's and Greater Than's

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
back into the actual < and >,

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and Reload this in my browser,

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
our text turns to bold.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So if we don't want our HTML to behave as HTML, we need to Escape it.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And if we want it to behave as HTML--we don't Escape it.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
All right. Try some Escaping on your own.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So what is the correct way to include the text:

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
& = & in rendered HTML?

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So it should look like this once it's rendered in the browser.

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,723
What do we need to include in the HTML to get that ?
