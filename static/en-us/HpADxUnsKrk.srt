00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,850
Okay let's, let's summarize this. What are all the things that UML can

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,360
provide for you in state descriptions? At the top is the word tracking, that's

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,700
the state label. We can have the entry action, we can have the exit action.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,610
UML supports the ideas of internal transitions. These are, you can

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,224
think of these as self transitions without the entry and exit actions. Okay,

6
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:27,780
UML now also supports the idea of activities. So we have actions and activities.

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,990
The difference here is that you can think of actions from the point of view of

8
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,650
the system as being things which are instantaneous. Typically that means that

9
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,010
we're turning something on or we're turning something off. And the time that it

10
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,440
takes to do that doesn't play in the rest of the, rest of the system.

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,260
Activities, however, are things which take time. Okay, the key word there is do,

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,830
and we're calling some kind of method which is going to take some time.

13
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:59,160
So we're going to be in this state while, while we're following the target. And

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,900
deferred events are a a, a special situation in,

15
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,890
in UML in which the set of events that the system is responding to are,

16
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,120
are queued, that is, put into a queue, and only processed at a later time.
