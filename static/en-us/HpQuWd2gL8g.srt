1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,540
Huh.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:05,300
So Chris, how did that rendering
performance go the other day?

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,520
>> Oh, man, everything's great.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,380
It's back to being superfast.

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,160
>> Yeah.

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,250
>> You know,
I hate to say it I think you were right.

7
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:12,850
>> Well Chris.

8
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,370
It's not about being right or
wrong, even though I'm right.

9
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,250
It's about understanding that in the
mobile application development space,

10
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,330
it's all about trade offs, right?

11
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,900
You have to make performance conscious
decisions between the features you

12
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,918
want and the applications and devices
that people are going to be running on.

13
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:28,470
You can't just run off into the weeds,
make whatever you want,

14
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,240
and then get mad at the system when it
doesn't perform the way you want it to.

15
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,810
>> Yeah, I know.

16
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,330
That's totally fair.

17
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,580
Oh wait.

18
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,560
With all of that extra frame time,
more animations.

19
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,440
>> Well, wait, no, Chris,
that's not what I was talk-
