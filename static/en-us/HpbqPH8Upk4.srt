00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,640
Mom and pop are working on building
a backend Flask web API for

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,860
their bagel shop.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,550
Download the code in
the instructor notes

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,918
to see the code they have thus far.

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:13,330
There's a /bagels route that exposes
all of the bagels in their inventory.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,930
A feature that only users that are Mom
& Pop's Bagel Shop members can view.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:18,690
Don't worry.

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,700
Becoming a member is free and easy.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,410
Help Mom and Pop by adding a user
class in their models.pie file

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,370
that securely stores user names and
hashed passwords.

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,000
Add a route for

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,390
users to register their accounts by
sending a post request to /users.

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,410
And protect the / bagel's endpoint such
that only members can view a bagel

14
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,620
directory.

15
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,370
When you are finished,
use the bagel tester,py file to test and

16
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,450
see that your code works.
