00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,238
Let's try another problem where we find the lowest common denominator. You'll

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:08,560
need to factor these denominators first, since they're not just monomials. As a

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,146
hint, your LCD will contain a constant and two binomials. And you'll want to

4
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:16,902
make sure you leave it in factored form. I know you might not have seen this

5
00:00:16,902 --> 00:00:21,737
before, but I want you to give it a try. If you get stuck, there's always this

6
00:00:21,737 --> 00:00:22,470
solution.
