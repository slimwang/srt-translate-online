1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,040
The first step to

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,460
having an awesome web application
is having an awesome game plan.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,220
Let's define what our prototype should
do after completing each iteration.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,020
Let's do some brainstorming to make
a checklist of deliverables that we

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,080
want to achieve with each
iteration of development,

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,660
by breaking down the project into
smaller, easier to manage mini-projects.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,340
In the first pass at this project,
we'll create mock-ups for

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,060
every page in the restaurant menu app,
and design URLs for each page as well.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,970
When I finish this iteration,
I can show my designs to my friends or

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,190
colleagues for feedback, and that's
enough work for our first iteration.

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,660
In the second iteration,
you'll set up all of the routings for

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,240
your application in Flask,
making sure you can navigate to

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,520
all of the URLs you want to create for
your application.

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,860
At the end of this iteration, you should
be able to navigate to all of your URLs,

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,710
even if the pages are not yet created.

16
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,660
After that, you will build on top of
what you made in the previous iteration

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,640
by creating all of your templates and
forms, and

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,870
making sure that they are properly
functioning within your application.

19
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,930
Once you have created and filled
out all of your HTML templates and

20
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,360
see them rendering in your application,
we can move on to the next iteration.

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,580
Now that you have a good grasp of
how your front-end code should look,

22
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,650
you will add the back-end functionality,
making sure all of the actions on

23
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,080
the web page are retrieving
data from your database.

24
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,250
When all of the code operations
work on all of your web pages,

25
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,470
you'll be finished with this iteration.

26
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,060
You will then add some endpoints
that allow the data to be sent if

27
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,380
the client requests a menu or
specific menu item in JSON form.

28
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,450
You will test these API calls
from within your browser to

29
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,230
know you have successfully
finished this step.

30
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,870
Finally, you will add some
styling with CSS, JavaScript, and

31
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,820
a few static images, to give your
application an appealing layout.

32
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,390
In this step, you will also incorporate
message flashing into your application.

33
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,130
I chose these steps to create our
application because I feel they

34
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,090
naturally build on top of each other,
and

35
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,360
have a clear deliverable at
the end of each iteration.

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,990
By keeping this in mind,
when you plan future projects,

37
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,400
you'll be better prepared for
all kinds of new challenges.
