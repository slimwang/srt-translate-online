00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,019
I'm B.F. Skinner, and Hippocrates and Mendel have done some nice work, but

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,900
are missing how important the environment can

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,680
be in shaping traits, particularly behavioral ones.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,630
>> So are you referring to that classic phrase, nature versus nurture?

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,980
>> Yeah, somewhat. When I was at Harvard in grad school

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,160
in the early 1930s I came up with this whole experiment that

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,010
tested the influence in the environment through conditioning. For example, I can

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,910
put a rat in this chamber, and then flash the green light.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,520
If the rat pushes the lever, it gets food. But if

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,010
the rat pushes the lever whenever the red light is up,

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,610
it gets a mild electric shock instead. Over time, the rat

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,930
learns only to push the lever when the green light is on.

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,394
>> So you're talking about behavioral traits, where

14
00:00:39,394 --> 00:00:41,888
reward and punishment play a significant role. And

15
00:00:41,888 --> 00:00:43,391
this is any type of trait, right? Like

16
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:46,055
aggression or even behaviors. Like, interacting with other people.

17
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:48,953
>> That's right. Understanding the stimuli is really important

18
00:00:48,953 --> 00:00:51,373
if we're going to understand the complex traits and

19
00:00:51,373 --> 00:00:53,697
the hereditary and environmental components.

20
00:00:53,697 --> 00:00:55,263
>> If you're interested in learning

21
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,639
