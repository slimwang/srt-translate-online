00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's start out by looking at a scale and some weights. A scale can determine if

2
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:07,750
the weights on the left side and the right side are equal, or if one side is

3
00:00:07,762 --> 00:00:11,695
heavier than the other. I've added some weights to the scale. The left side of

4
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:15,800
the scale has a total of 8 pounds. The right side of the scale also has a total

5
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:20,050
of 8 pounds. We can write an equation that represents the weight of these scales

6
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:25,433
on each side. I have 6 pounds and 2 pounds is equal to 5 pounds and 3 pounds. We

7
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:30,260
know they both make 8. Now, let's do something crazy. Let's add a ton of weight

8
00:00:30,272 --> 00:00:34,870
to both sides, like 100 pounds. Think about what'd happen to the scale, and try

9
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:39,455
and answer this question. If 100 pounds of weight is added to both sides, which

10
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:45,320
side weighs the most? The left, the right, or they weigh the same.
