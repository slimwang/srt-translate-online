00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,406
>> First we're going to consider just 8x squared plus 20x. In the two

2
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:09,352
coefficients, there's a common factor of 4. And in the variables, there's a

3
00:00:09,352 --> 00:00:14,498
common factor of x. So we have 4x times what's left over in each term, 2x plus

4
00:00:14,498 --> 00:00:19,958
5. Wonderful. Now let's look at 6x plus 15. We can only consider it the constant

5
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:24,968
parts of each term, since there's no variable portion of 15. And 6 and 15 are

6
00:00:24,968 --> 00:00:30,236
both divisible by 3. And then we're left with, surprise, 2x plus 5. Wonderful.

7
00:00:30,236 --> 00:00:35,404
So we have 4x times the quantity 2x plus 5 plus 3 times the quantity 2x plus 5.
