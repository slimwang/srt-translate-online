1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
When we are debugging, we proceed the very same way.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Indeed, we're treating bugs as if they were natural phenomenon.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So, our hypothesis would be grounded on the initial observation of the failure

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and possible also all the knowledge we do have about our program.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The failing run, more runs, the original failure, program code--

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
all of these goes into our forming a hypothesis.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
At the end of the process, we get a consistent description of how the failure came to be.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We don't call this a theory. Theory is a bit far fetched for a simple failure.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Instead, we call this a diagnosis of the original failure.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It may sound a bit far-fetched to apply a method

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that has been devised for studying natural phenomena

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and for coming up with theories about natural phenomena on something as artificial as bugs.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
However, errors and nature have something in common, none of them are under our control.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And the scientific method is precisely the method which you need

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
for explaining something that is not under our control.
