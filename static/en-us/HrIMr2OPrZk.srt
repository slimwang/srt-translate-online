What do you think David?

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,610
>> So
this is kind of an interesting example.

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,390
If we recall back in our original
tree as to the incremental

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,780
concept learning process, we saw that
there was those do nothing bubbles,

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,200
that if a negative example does
not fit our current definition,

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,385
we wouldn't actually modify
our current definition.

7
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:18,536
Here this doesn't even fit
our current concept of a foo.

8
00:00:18,536 --> 00:00:22,715
Our current concept of a foo has a brick
on top, whereas this is a wedge on top.

9
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:25,494
So this doesn't even fit, so we don't
actually need to change our concept,

10
00:00:25,494 --> 00:00:26,805
it doesn't fit already.

11
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:28,215
>> Good, very good.

12
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:33,415
If the example is a negative instance,
and the current definition of

13
00:00:33,415 --> 00:00:36,145
the concept already excludes it,
we don't have to do anything.
