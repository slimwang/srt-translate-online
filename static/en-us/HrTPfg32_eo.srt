1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So there's always some software under test.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And this might be something huge like the Linux kernel,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
it might be something really small like a new square root function that we wrote,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but, in any case, what we want to be able to do

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
is draw a box around the software that we're testing.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In general, the reason that we implemented the software

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
is to provide some sort of a service that we're going to use in other software

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
that we're going to provide to a user.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And what that means is the software under test is providing some set of APIs--

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that just stands for application programming interfaces--

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and all this means is the software under test is going to provide a set of function calls

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
that can be called by other software.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And of course, that's what we want to be testing.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So for the next little while, let's assume a really simple piece of software under test.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's assume that it's just a square root routine that we have implemented,

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and we want to make sure that it works.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So to test this code, all we're going to need to do is pass values into the software--

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
so here we're calling square root routine with 9 as an input--and see what it returns,

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
see if it returns the thing that we expected.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's just take a quick quiz here.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If I call a square root routine--and here let's assume

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
that we're not talking about the Python square root;

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
we're just talking about a general square root function

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
that we're implementing for some hypothetical piece of software.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So we invoke the square root routine with 9. And what should it return?

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Here we're going to make a multiple choice exam,

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and you should enter into the text box all of the answers that apply.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So answer a) is 3, answer b) is -3.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Go ahead and please write your answer in the text box.
