Say I apply a uniform scale to an object centered at the origin and then

2
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:08,510
translate it. That's case A. I start again and apply the translation first to

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,484
the object then scale it. That's case B. Assuming that the scale and translation

4
00:00:12,484 --> 00:00:16,170
factors actually do something. I'm not scaling by one or moving zero feet or

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,634
anything like that. Mark any of the following that are always true. First,

6
00:00:19,634 --> 00:00:24,430
neither object's center has moved from the origin. The object is the same size

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,643
in both cases. The object's is in the same position in both cases. The object's

8
00:00:28,643 --> 00:00:31,533
center has moved farther in case B than in case A.
