1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,520
All right, so the parent method
is actually sepiaAndDisplayImage.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,090
So let's go back to trace view and
see what we mean.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,890
All right, so
here we are back in trace view.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,900
Now if we expand our
collapsible menus here,

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,650
we can actually walk up
the parent calling stack and

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,980
see that set pixel is actually
called by sepia and display image.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,140
Now, this is within our
busy UI thread activity.

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,900
So, let's go ahead and
see how we can optimize.
