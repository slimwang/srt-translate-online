00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,589
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:04,450
In this lesson you'll be experimenting
with different techniques for

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,120
creating chains of asynchronous work.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,670
Asynchronous work is rarely isolated,
and

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:15,030
as such you may have many asynchronous
actions that depend on one another.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,870
This is another strong suit of promises.

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,410
Rather than creating a pyramid of doom,
promises make it straightforward to

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,170
chain together lots of
asynchronous actions.

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,890
And it even works when you're generating
those actions programatically.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,950
To get started, you'll be
manually creating a chain of work

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,250
to load a planet thumbnail in
the exoplanet explorer app.
