1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,230
Okay, so let's look at our issue quiz solution.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,900
We have these two instructions to issue. This is the older one to issue. So

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,309
we're going to get a divide, or multiply reservation station.

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:22,270
Mark that this is a divide. F1 and F2. Or maybe this parameters.

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:28,330
Look here, you find it RS4 and RS1 are going to produce that value, so

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,439
we don't get any values from the registered file. And then we're going to update

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,730
for F4 that the result is going to come out of RS5. And now we're done with

8
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,320
this instruction. This instruction cannot issue. Because it's a multiplication

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,540
instruction, all of the divide multiplier reservation stations ar busy.

10
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,940
So until one of these finishes, this instruction isn't going to issue, and

11
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,330
so now our issue part is going to be stalled until that is resolved
