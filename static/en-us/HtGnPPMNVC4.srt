One final bit on camera access. Of course on a

2
00:00:03,122 --> 00:00:07,338
mobile device, that typically has a front-facing and a rear-facing camera,

3
00:00:07,338 --> 00:00:09,942
you're going to want to select which camera to use

4
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:12,130
or let the user select it. There's a way to do

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:17,380
this with get user media using the MediaStreamTrack getSources api.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,090
This api will return a list of IDs that you can

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,980
then pass into get user media. And that lets you choose

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,070
which camera to use. As you can tell on my phone,

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,550
I have two cameras to choose from.
