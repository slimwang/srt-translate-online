1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,060
Now I will give you another type of problem and this time you can prove that this problem is

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,800
undecidable, and the problem is as follows and that problem is also one that sounds very simple.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,840
It's the equivalence problem. So this time, we're given two programs, P and P prime,

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,540
and the question that we want to answer is do this two programs do exactly the same thing?

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,790
For example, do they implement exactly the same algorithm only using a different type of

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,850
implementation, and now, what I would like you to do is prove that equivalence is undecidable

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,630
by showing that if you have an algorithm that would solve equivalence then you could also solve

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,130
the halting problem. Now, the way we're going to do this quiz is as follows:

9
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:45,390
I have here six building blocks or potential building blocks of this group, and I would like you to do

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,690
the following: There are four building blocks that you actually need for the proof and there are two

11
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:56,090
building blocks, which are not necessary for the proof. And what I want you to do is to find out

12
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,980
which building blocks you need and which you don't need, and for the building blocks that you

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:05,820
need bring them in the right order. So, right one next to the building blocks that would come first

14
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,960
in a proof of undecidability of equivalence then you write a 2 next to the next building block and so on.

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,650
It might be easier to first think of how you would prove this and then fill out the boxes

16
00:01:16,650 --> 99:59:59,999
rather than playing around with them. How you prove that equivalence is undecidable?
