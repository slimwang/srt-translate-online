1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is the second choice.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If it were possible to compute discrete logs quickly,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and our adversary had a way to do that,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
well then, they could compute the discrete log of the

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
intercepted value y-A, the g, and the q values,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
which were also intercepted.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Those ones were public,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and the result of this would be the

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
x-A value that was Alice's secret,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and then the adversary can

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
compute the key the same way that Alice would.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This was the only secret value,

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and if you had the discrete log function,

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
you could compute that secret value.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The second answer doesn't compute the right thing.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's computing the straight log of y-B,

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which would be the y-A value.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's not the value that is necessary to compute the key.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The third value doesn't use discrete log.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If we could actually compute the key this way,

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
well then the protocol would be completely

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
unsecure because it turns out that

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
modular exponentiation is a function

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that we can compute efficiently,

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and it's necessary that we can compute modular exponentiation efficiently

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
because otherwise, the legitimate participates

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
in the protocol wouldn't be able to determine their keys.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So we will look at that soon.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Before doing that, I want to emphasize that this is not a proof

30
00:01:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that breaking discrete log is hard.
