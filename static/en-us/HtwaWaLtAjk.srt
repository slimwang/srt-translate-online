1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,520
So a view is a virtual table.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,810
It's a derived table from data
that is in table that you store.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,790
You can run a query on it, and
actually can produce set of tuples,

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,700
maybe certain attribute values have
been removed, or something like that.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,550
And that table is what is
called a database view.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,810
So, the question here is saying,
we can use such a virtual table, or

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,110
derived table, or database view,
to enhance security,

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,020
because one of these two reasons.

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,740
So choose the answer you
think is the best one.
