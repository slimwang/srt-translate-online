1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,931
So the first successful
pitch meeting was very cool.

2
00:00:04,931 --> 00:00:07,260
We made a lot of progress.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,750
We had terms set up and we decided
that we were going to meet again and

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,680
going to bring my co-founders and
we're going to sign term sheet,

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,630
and I came to that
meeting like a winner.

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,380
Hey, I'm here.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,820
Where's the money?

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,370
Those are the co-founders,
let's get on with it.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:34,830
And the investor looked at me and said,
Norm, I'm not in your pocket, you know.

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,590
I think that you're going to get
three or four more investors

11
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,730
that will commit the same amount
of money, and then we'll proceed.

12
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,620
I don't know any more investors.

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,380
I just got introduced to you by
someone that I'm working with.

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,010
But we did, we did that.

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,120
We went and brought more investors
to participate in the same round and

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,680
he eventually gave me the money and
he became one of my dearest friends and

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,690
that was the story of
the first investor.
