1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,040
One of the big differences
between mobile and

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,470
desktop VR platforms is the concept
of 3DOF versus 6DOF tracking.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,570
Now you might be wondering,
what's a DOF?

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,570
Well, DOF is short for
Degrees Of Freedom.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,900
And it deals with how accurately
the VR system can track you.

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,890
For a VR headset, it's the difference
between knowing only where

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,890
you're looking and where you're
looking and located in the room.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,380
Three degrees of freedom means your head
can be trapped when it rotates along

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,980
the x-axis, the y-axis and the z-axis.

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,440
This is what most
mobile VR platforms do.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,500
Six degrees of freedom means your head
can also be tracked when it moves

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,460
along the x axis,
the y axis, the z axis.

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,720
Six tough tracking allows you to be
tracked as you move around the room.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,074
High NVR systems allow you to do this.

15
00:01:02,074 --> 00:01:08,605
So to recap, 3DOF means your head
rotations are accurately tracked.

16
00:01:08,605 --> 00:01:15,015
Whereas, 6DOF means your head
rotations and positions are tracked.

17
00:01:15,015 --> 00:01:16,664
Great.

18
00:01:16,664 --> 00:01:19,058
Now that we've covered 3DOF versus 6DOF,

19
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:22,020
let's learn about how this
tracking is accomplished.
