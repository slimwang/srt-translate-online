1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,160
Let's look at how this Gaussian filters can be used for smoothly.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,010
Let's start off with our simple image here.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,620
again, I'm just showing a simple example image.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,850
Of course, now take a Gaussian with a variance of 1.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:15,730
again, if you notice,

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,400
it's a much more peak and less distribution as you go away from the peak.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,800
But gets down to 0 pretty quickly.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,250
So the image, of course, is blurred, but appears to be relatively sharp.

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,210
As you go and increase the the variance here,

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,710
and now we have a Gaussian with a sigma of 3, gets more blurred.

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,910
Furthermore, as we go down and actually go to sigma 6 it gets even more blurred.

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,515
As we get to sigma 9 you can see the blurring, the Gaussian blurring,

13
00:00:42,515 --> 00:00:44,460
is much more increased.

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,880
So here from this point to that point we're basically changing the variables of

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,030
how the Gaussian kernel sigma changes and it

16
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,150
basically then represents the extent of smoothing that we can play around with.
