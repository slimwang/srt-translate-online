1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,360
The next step in our plan is to check

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,710
the text that we've read thus far for profanity. Now,

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,310
to do this, I searched the Internet and found

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:14,010
this website called wdyl.com or what do you love. This

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,430
website was developed by Google and one of the

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,870
things it does is that it can tell us if

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,060
a word is a curse word or not. So,

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,500
if I go to this website's profanity link, which is

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,030
profanity question mark q, by the way, this

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,180
link is also available in the instructor notes

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,920
and try out the word shot, S-H-O-T and

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,590
see what happens. ha, the website's response is false

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,750
which means that this word, the word shot, is not a curse word. But if I

14
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,890
change this word by just one letter and

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,770
hit Enter. The response is a little bit different.

16
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,170
I can even give this website a sentence or a paragraph. So let me, in place of

17
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:02,890
saying one word, say, I can take a shot at it and hit

18
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:08,200
Enter, and the response is false, which means that this sentence is fine. But,

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,300
if I change one word in that sentence, so I will say, I can, well, you know,

20
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,910
and then hit Enter. Ooh, the response now is

21
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,740
true, which means that there is a curse word

22
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,380
in this sentence. [SOUND] All we have to do

23
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,690
now is do what we've been doing, but using code.
