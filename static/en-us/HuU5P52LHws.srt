1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,110
So, rotation tends to be difficult for
a lot of developers, and

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,540
I think especially new developers,
they don't completely understand.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,900
So, I think just having a very basic,
hey,

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,080
do you understand some
of the life cycles.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,770
You don't necessarily, I don't think
there's much use in having you draw all

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,860
of it out, because you have
that your documentation.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:23,230
But understanding when and where sales
persist and what to expect from that.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,910
So, Sam for instance,
he understood that partiables would be

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,370
a great solution to what he was
looking for, and that's great.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,510
I didn't fault him for

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,140
not knowing why serializable is
bad because it's a bad solution.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,790
So, that's completely fine.

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,890
And, I think if you had
more Java knowledge,

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,230
you understand why that's probably
not a very performance option.

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,670
But, it's still good that he knew
the correct answer in Android.
