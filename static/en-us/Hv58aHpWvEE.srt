1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,120
To figure this out,

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,850
I first created a variable to store
the number of problem students.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,430
Then I wrote a similar loop to earlier,

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,700
where I look at each account
key in the enrollment table and

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,510
check whether that account key was
present in the daily engagement table.

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,310
I also added another check to see
whether the join date was equal to

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,730
the cancel date.

8
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,270
I could have also looked at whether
days to cancel was equal to zero.

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,330
Then, if there was a missing student for
whom the two dates were not equal,

10
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,450
I added one to the total
number of problem students.

11
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,450
At the end of the loop,
I looked at that number and

12
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,930
I saw that there were still
three surprising records left.
