1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,418
Now that we found the balance after the first 2 years, it would be great if we

2
00:00:03,418 --> 00:00:10,072
could find it even further along in time. Let's work right now to find the

3
00:00:10,072 --> 00:00:14,434
balance after 3 years. Actually, you already did this earlier, but I'd like us

4
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:19,058
to write it in this kind of notation. We start with this amount, since that's

5
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:25,352
how much money there is at the start of your three. And then, the amount that

6
00:00:25,352 --> 00:00:32,555
we need to add to this in interest, is just this quantity times 0.03. If we

7
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:37,454
factor out this quantity from both terms, then we end up, once again, with 1

8
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:44,430
plus 0.03, inside this second set of parentheses. However, since we have 1 plus

9
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,821
0.03 squared here, times that quantity again, 1 plus point 0 3. We can make

10
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:54,941
this look more compact, by changing our exponent up here. Instead of squared,

11
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:59,619
this is cubed this time. Now that we have another quantity continuing our

12
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:05,150
pattern here, what do you think about the guess that you made just before this?

13
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,866
Do you want to keep it as is, or do you want to change it? Think about what

14
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:13,136
pattern you see. Think about what you think the exponent in each of these

15
00:01:13,136 --> 00:01:17,426
expressions means, and then use that information, that pattern to write down

16
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:24,105
the balance in this form after 4 years, after 10 years, and after 100 years.

17
00:01:24,105 --> 00:01:28,404
I'll also give you another chance to write down your hypothesis. You can write

18
00:01:28,404 --> 00:01:31,752
in exactly what you wrote before or you can change it this time, taking into

19
00:01:31,752 --> 00:01:37,580
account the new information we have now. Once again, this part won't be graded.

20
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,170
We are, however, going to see how your numbers look.
