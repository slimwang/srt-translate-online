1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,360
So there is no real correct answer to this quiz if

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,600
you really don't like money, I guess you could prefer not

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,870
to be paid at all. The closest thing to a correct

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,890
answer is that it depends, and it depends on how you

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,920
interpret the meaning of biweekly. We could look that up in

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,230
the dictionary to decide how we should interpret it, and if

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,390
we look up biweekly in the dictionary, what we see is

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,725
the definition of biweekly, which is right here. It says happening

9
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:29,710
every two weeks is the first definition. The

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,150
second definition is happening twice a week. If you

11
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,450
have the first definition, you'd rather be paid

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,380
weekly, assuming you'd like more money. If you have

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,130
the second definition, you'd rather be paid biweekly.

14
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,370
Maybe that's the problem with paper dictionaries, that they're

15
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,140
not very precise, because they're old things. Let's look

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,040
up a more modern dictionary, let's see what Wiktionary

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,920
has to say about this. So, here's the Wiktionary entry for

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,780
biweekly, and if we scroll down, we can see that it has two

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,200
meanings. Occurring once every two weeks, occurring twice a week,

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,450
this is chiefly in the UK the American

21
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,400
dictionary didn't seem to think that. It seemed to

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,150
think both definitions occurred in both countries. So,

23
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,150
this is a pretty big problem. If we wrote

24
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,450
a computer program and the program was doing our payroll

25
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,350
and had to decide what it meant to pay someone biweekly,

26
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,300
we want to make sure it understood that the same

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,680
way the programmer did. So that's one important reason why we

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,380
need to invent new languages like Python to program computers,

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,000
rather than using natural languages that we already understand. And that's

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,380
because we don't really understand languages like English or Mandarin, that

31
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,830
there's lots of things that different people will understand different ways.

32
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,850
And this happens at the granularity of words like biweekly.

33
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,540
It also happens in complete sentences where there are many different

34
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,410
ways to interpret the same phrase. Another reason we don't use

35
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,930
natural languages for programming is that natural languages are actually very

36
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,230
verbose. To write a program, we need to describe exactly

37
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,220
what the computer should do in very precise sequence of steps.

38
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,760
If we had to describe all those details using a natural

39
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,890
language, that would require a huge amount of text. So we'll

40
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,900
see soon that with a programming language like Python,

41
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,430
we only need a few lines of code to

42
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,320
describe a complicated thing and describe it in a

43
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,200
very precise, step by step way. So I want

44
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,360
you to think about as we write programs in

45
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,880
this class, how much more detail you need to

46
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,650
actually describe in English, precisely how to do what

47
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,860
we're describing with a few lines of Python code.
