00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This question is on Public Key Cryptography.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Suppose Alice has a public and private key pair

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and that Bob has a public and private key pair

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
where we have the subscript A for Alice and B for Bob.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Alice wants to send a message to Bob

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
in a way that protects us from eavesdroppers

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and proves to Bob that the message was generated by Alice and intended for Bob.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And so the question is what message should Alice send.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that apply.
