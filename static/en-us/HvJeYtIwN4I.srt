00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,770
ARPU is the average revenue per user.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,939
And remember that's calculated
by dividing your total revenue

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,860
by your total number of users.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,600
IAP stands for in-app purchase.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,830
And that's anytime a user makes
a purchase inside of your app.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,380
ARPPU is then the average
revenue per paying user.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,050
And that's calculated by
taking your total revenue, and

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,090
dividing it by the total number of
users who have made a purchase.
