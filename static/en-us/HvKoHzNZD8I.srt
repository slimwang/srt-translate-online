1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,080
In Chrome Dev Tools,
there are two records that you might see

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,070
relating to layers or
composite to layers.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,810
The first one is Update Layer Tree,
which happens when Chrome's internal

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:15,705
engine, called Blink, figures out
what layers are needed for the page.

5
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:19,180
It looks at the styles of
the elements and tries to figure out

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,946
what order everything should be in and
how many layers it needs.

7
00:00:22,946 --> 00:00:26,505
Composite Layers is the other
record where the browser is now

8
00:00:26,505 --> 00:00:30,025
putting the page together
to send to the screen.

9
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:31,631
The more layers you have,

10
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:35,647
the more time will be spent in
layer management and compositing.

11
00:00:35,647 --> 00:00:38,651
So there's a tradeoff between
reducing paint time, and

12
00:00:38,651 --> 00:00:40,600
increasing layer management time.
