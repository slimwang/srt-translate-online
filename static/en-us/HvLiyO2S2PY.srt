1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,464
Okay, so let's set this up.

2
00:00:02,464 --> 00:00:07,401
We're going to issue a 302 redirect

3
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:11,865
to https://www.eff.org.

4
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:17,730
And we're going to set that up on an nc
listener, listening on board 2345.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,830
And then pull our ye olde web browser,
put in my IP address and port number.

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,380
And sure enough, we get redirected
to the EFF's home page.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,090
But just like before,

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,500
the initial request from the browser
does get displayed by nc.

9
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:39,450
This is what nc received in response
to which it sent this redirect,

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,390
which sent our browser over to the EFF.
