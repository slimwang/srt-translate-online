1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,171
Clark-Wilson, remember, defines as
transactions or procedures that

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:10,400
you're able to execute, and you can
define who should be able to do what and

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,299
things like that, based on what
they're doing in the organization.

4
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,389
It doesn't address the conflict thing.

5
00:00:17,389 --> 00:00:18,828
The conflict thing is addressed.

6
00:00:18,828 --> 00:00:21,452
So, the correct answer is Chinese Wall.

7
00:00:21,452 --> 00:00:24,470
So remember,
we talked about conflict classes?

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,310
So similar, for example, airlines all
because they compete with each other

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,150
would be in a single conflict class.

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,955
And then we said, as soon as you
access one company's information,

11
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:38,300
you're not allowed to access from any
other company the same conflict class.

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,088
That was the Chinese Wall policy.

13
00:00:40,088 --> 00:00:44,168
That's what would work here in this
case, because if lawyers lurking on this

14
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:48,075
competing companies, if the same
lawyer does that, that is a conflict.

15
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:49,707
We want to avoid that, and

16
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:53,800
you avoid conflict of interest by
using the Chinese Wall policy.
