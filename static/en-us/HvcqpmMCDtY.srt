00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,318
So here's another one for you to try out on your own. I've given you the

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,520
expression 4 minus i divided by 1 plus 5 i. And I'd like you to go about

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,478
changing the denominator to a real number, so that you can eventually write this

4
00:00:13,478 --> 00:00:17,791
number in the form a plus bi. Then fill your final answer into this box.
