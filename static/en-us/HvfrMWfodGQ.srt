1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,160
We know how to handle an explicit intent
where we know exactly what activity we

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,459
want to start.

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:08,000
But what about the times
when we don't know or

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,539
don't care how our requests
will be fulfilled?

5
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,799
Enter implicit intents.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,970
If we want to retrieve a contact or
an image,

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,870
or call a number, implicit intents
indicate an action to be done and

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,850
an optional bit of data
on which to execute it,

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,530
like picking a contact from the contacts
content provider, or dialing a number.

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:31,200
Do we really need to know which
application will fulfill the request?

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,118
No.

12
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:35,810
And if we try to specify the app, it may
not even be available on your user's

13
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,090
device, and if it is installed the user
may have different preferences.

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,090
For example, they may want all of their
camera requests to go to Open Camera

15
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,219
instead of the full camera app.

16
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,859
If I only have one app on my phone that
can fulfill a particular intent request,

17
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:52,519
it's automatically run.

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,030
Otherwise, the Android OS
will let me choose and

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,280
indicate if I want all future requests
to be handled by the same app.
