00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,070
We're now into version two of UML. Which has as a total 14 different kinds

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,970
of diagrams. We're going to go over those quickly here but in the course we're

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,430
not going to be using all of them. We're going to concentrate on just three or

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,110
four of them. And we'll have special lessons devoted to those but I wanted you

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,790
to at least be aware of the different kinds of diagrams that are there.

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:29,110
That said, on a particular project, you're unlikely to use all the diagrams.

7
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,180
You're going to use the ones appropriate to the particular project.

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,810
In particular, determine what is the trickiest part of the project and

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,370
use the diagram that helps you best understand that tricky part.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,800
The two main categories of diagrams are structural and behavioral.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,370
Structural diagrams give you the pieces of the system that are always there and

12
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,290
the relationships among them. Behavioral diagrams on the other hand,

13
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:02,220
are concerned with the executions of the system. And the particular diagram

14
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:08,620
may only convey one execution. That is, you may have to have multiple sequence

15
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,410
diagrams in order to get a good feel for all of the behaviors of the system
