1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,009
Now lets consider a three with
a branching factor of three.

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:09,187
How many nodes are visited at levels 0,
1, 2, 3 and 4?

3
00:00:09,188 --> 00:00:10,750
Tell us the number tree nodes, and

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,349
also a number of nodes visited
by iterative deepening.
