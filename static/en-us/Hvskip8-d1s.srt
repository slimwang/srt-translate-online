00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,930
The Visitor pattern is an example of a behavioral pattern.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,330
And in order to describe the behavior, we use a sequence diagram in this case.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,170
Recall that in the sequence diagram,

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,730
each of the columns corresponds to a different object.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,120
The horizontal lines correspond to messages being sent among the objects.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,390
And that time marches down the page.

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,702
The first column in the diagram corresponds to the data structure itself.

8
00:00:24,702 --> 00:00:29,063
And it is responsible for sending messages to each of the concrete classes, and

9
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:32,710
those messages are accept messages passing in whatever visitor we

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,930
currently want to implement.

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,190
The concrete classes are in the second column.

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,892
Their responsibility is for doing the callback.

13
00:00:39,892 --> 00:00:43,090
That is, they are given a visitor as an argument and

14
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:49,560
they need to pass themselves to the particular visitor operation responsible for

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,830
whatever visitor they're currently implementing.

16
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,600
Those are the messages at the top which go from the second column over to

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,090
the fourth column and

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,550
in the middle of the screen from the third column over to the fourth column.

19
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:05,220
Finally, in the visitor operation itself in the fourth column,

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,020
can make calls back into the elements,

21
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,790
taking advantage of whatever operations those elements provide.
