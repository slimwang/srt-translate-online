1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,062
We're now ready to run our test and
collect data from our stores for

2
00:00:05,062 --> 00:00:06,955
March 20th to May 28th.

3
00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:11,794
The first treatment group of stores will
change the price of their facials to

4
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:17,327
76.99 and the second group will change
the price of their facials to 87.99.

5
00:00:17,327 --> 00:00:18,611
After collecting data for

6
00:00:18,611 --> 00:00:21,479
ten weeks, we'll be ready to
perform the A/B Analysis.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,140
Let's start by preparing our data.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,150
We have two data files
available to use our analysis.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,340
The point of sale transactions
file contains transaction data for

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,198
each invoice where each row contains
a line item for the invoice.

11
00:00:37,198 --> 00:00:41,834
The point of sale transaction file
has transactions from January 1st,

12
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:44,651
2013 through June 29th, 2014.

13
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:48,186
We also have an Excel file with
information on the stores that we used

14
00:00:48,186 --> 00:00:50,185
as treatment units.

15
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:53,730
This data file contains the store
identifier and the price level for

16
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,740
facials at each store.

17
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,767
We need to prepare the data, so we can
leverage the Altiris A/B Trend tool and

18
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:04,680
A/B Controls tool to create
sets of control stores

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,010
that we can use to compare
to the treatment units.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,959
Using our two data files,
we'll create three data files.

21
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:16,658
The weekly store traffic for
the A/B Trend tool, the store list for

22
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:21,607
the A/B Controls tool that will use
to match treatment units to control

23
00:01:21,607 --> 00:01:25,255
units and the sales data for
the A/B Analysis tool.

24
00:01:25,255 --> 00:01:29,897
To start with, we need to filter the
data to only include transactions from

25
00:01:29,897 --> 00:01:33,591
February 7th,
2013 through May 28th, 2014.

26
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:39,933
Remember that the test period lasted ten
weeks from March 28th to May 28th, 2014.

27
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:44,175
Data is arrogated to a weekly level
turn move missing values which

28
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:48,120
would cause the A/B Trend and
A/B Controls tools to error.

29
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,434
First, we'll create a table that holds
the weekly store traffic information

30
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:55,783
that contains the number of
invoices per week at each store.

31
00:01:55,783 --> 00:02:00,407
We'll use this data with A/B Trend tool
to create measures of trend and seasonal

32
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:04,637
patterns that can be used in helping
to match treatment to control units.

33
00:02:04,637 --> 00:02:06,779
For our analysis, we use the week and

34
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:09,693
week begin fields to
calculate the weekend date.

35
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:12,609
The weekend date is the field
that we need for analysis, but

36
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:16,183
we might be able to use the other dates,
so we'll leave them in our data.

37
00:02:16,183 --> 00:02:20,027
Next, we need to create a data table
that shows the stores, the region and

38
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:22,941
the group that the store is in,
controller treatment.

39
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:26,424
And if treatment, what was the price
of the facial at that store?

40
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:30,450
This data will be used with the A/B
Controls tool using information from

41
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,552
the A/B Trends tool to create control
treatment pairs for the analysis.

42
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:38,670
Finally, we'll aggregate the sales data,
to show the weekly sales and

43
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,519
gross margin per store of all
transactions that included a facial to

44
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:43,820
perform an analysis.

45
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,520
Sounds like a lot data preparation, but
it's much less work than it sounds.
