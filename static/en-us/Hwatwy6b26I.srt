1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,140
Both these algorithms it turns out
have been used in the sequential games

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,361
setting, the games.

3
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:09,930
>> Most solution concepts are usually
useful in all those things.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,430
You should mention one other thing
which is we actually pointed out

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:18,140
that something that we talked about last
time was in fact a solution concept.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,100
But Nash.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,531
>> Nash and?

8
00:00:20,531 --> 00:00:21,810
>> Subgame perfect.

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,830
>> Right.
Right, by the way worth pointing out.

10
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,250
That the King Solomon alternative.

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,000
That I described before
is subgame perfect.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,180
>> All right.

13
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,580
Well so let's flip over to that.

14
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,170
Which is mechanism design.

15
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,400
We talked about.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,130
>> Two things in particular.

17
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,000
We talked about peer teaching.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,110
>> Right.

19
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,950
>> And we talked about King Solomon.

20
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,060
>> Dividing up babies.

21
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,080
>> Baby division.

22
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,640
Never ever divide by zero.

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,670
Now what's interesting about mechanism
design, sort of the flip side or

24
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,690
compliment of what we normally think
about in playing games is that one could

25
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:01,970
look at a lot of these solution concepts
as in fact being mechanism design.

26
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,870
Right, you create coco values as
a way of encouraging certain kinds of

27
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,980
behavior by setting up
binding side payments.

28
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,890
You think of correlated equilibria
as working because you've created

29
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,110
a mechanism, this shared source of
randomization that will encourage

30
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,340
behavior that it wouldn't
otherwise encourage.

31
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,810
Therefore all the solution concepts
can be thought of, sort of,

32
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,750
at least all the ones beyond the kind of
obvious when the natural delivery in any

33
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,910
way I think about that, can be thought
of as a kind of mechanism design.

34
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,690
These extensions,

35
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,600
these things that we introduce are to
induce certain kinds of behavior.

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,160
And so, even if we didn't want to
think too hard about mechanism design,

37
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,530
I wanted to believe it wasn't really
a part of reinforcement learning.

38
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,520
It really is, because all of these
things that we come up with as these

39
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,940
sort of extensions solution concepts are
really about getting better outcomes.

40
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,650
>> And they're all about
driving behavior using rewards.

41
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,183
>> Right, which is so
much better than Driving Ms. Daisy.

42
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,080
So I think that's everything
that we've learned.

43
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,208
Okay, so what's next.

44
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:07,310
>> I think we're done
actually with the material.

45
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,150
We have kind of a wrap up that
we need to do like an outtro and

46
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,020
so yes we're getting down to
the to the near terminal state.

47
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,610
>> Nice.

48
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,500
Well I think it's good well this is been
fun I mean I guess I will get to see you

49
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,330
again after this because we do have
a few things that we need to do, but

50
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,878
I think we've covered all the material.

51
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:27,293
>> Wow.
Well done.

52
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:27,910
Great.

53
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,272
Well, good job everybody.

54
00:02:29,272 --> 00:02:32,440
Yeah good job,
I guess I will see you later Michael.

55
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:32,940
Bye
>> Bye.
