1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,020
So the truth is that the class movie

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,574
can contain whatever we want it to contain. And

3
00:00:05,574 --> 00:00:08,390
in this case, I will pick the movie's

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:13,494
title, its youtube_trailer, its reviews, the storyline and its

5
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:16,880
poster_image. Now that decision will mean, that if

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,920
I said something like toy_story.storyline. The program will print

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,475
this. A story of a boy and his toys that come to life, and if I said,

8
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:29,170
avatar.show_trailer, the program would play avatar's YouTube

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,980
trailer. So, in summation, when designing the class

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,390
Movie, we probably want to remember data like

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,110
the movie's title, its storyline, its poster image,

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,410
and the link to its YouTube trailer. And one thing we may want to do

13
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,740
with this data, is to have a show

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,840
trailer function which opens the movie's YouTube trailer.

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,170
Okay, let's turn this design, into code.
