00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,028
We've seen how adding just simple color textures can vastly improve the look of

2
00:00:03,028 --> 00:00:07,255
a model. GPUs are very much optimized to access textures having considerable

3
00:00:07,255 --> 00:00:12,175
numbers of transistors dedicated to just this task. This in turn has led to a

4
00:00:12,175 --> 00:00:15,954
huge number of uses for textures. The idea of applying two or more textures has

5
00:00:15,954 --> 00:00:20,154
any number of other uses. For example, a surface can be made visually rich by

6
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:23,162
giving it textures that add scratches, decals, planetary cloud cover or any

7
00:00:23,162 --> 00:00:27,480
number of other phenomena. Multiple textures can be combined by addition,

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,304
multiplication or other operations and all affect the same attribute. Mirror

9
00:00:32,304 --> 00:00:35,120
reflection can be done by rendering from a different angle and then using the

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,447
reflected image as a texture used at each pixel. This is a whole huge sub

11
00:00:39,447 --> 00:00:42,027
category where a scene is rendered, and then its resulting image is post

12
00:00:42,027 --> 00:00:45,880
processed in various ways. We'll talk a bit more about these when we get into

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,346
shader programming. Because three.js is a web component, it can interact in

14
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:54,520
interesting ways with other data. For example, you can take a video and use it

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,223
as a texture. This texture can then be placed on multiple moving screens as

16
00:00:58,223 --> 00:01:01,768
shown in this demo. Now that you know the basics of texture mapping, you're

17
00:01:01,768 --> 00:01:04,840
equipped to go ahead and dig into other people's demos and see what makes them

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,187
tick. Better yet, you can not try out some of your own effects. Texturing is a

19
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:12,250
powerful tool and I look forward to seeing what you do with it.
