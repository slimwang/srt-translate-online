1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,380
Let's look at how to track
what users do in your app.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,050
First, you need to identify
what's important to know

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,340
about what your users are doing.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,859
Do you care if they set preferences?

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,540
Maybe you want to know if they
reach a certain level in your game.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,920
Perhaps you want to know if they ordered
takeout, or if they clicked an ad.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,110
So here's a code to send
an event hit to Analytics.

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,300
You create the tracker.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,380
Should know how to do that by now.

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,550
Then you use an event builder
to build an event hit.

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,010
You set the category,
the action, and the label.

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,430
And these three things, the category,
the action, and the label,

13
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,090
are going to show up in
the Analytics Dashboard.

14
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,200
And you put this code wherever
you want to record the event.

15
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,850
So I'd like to know which of
the dinner options are unpopular,

16
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,370
which ones people don't
want to see again.

17
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,000
So I'm going to add the code to track
the event in the method that's called

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,500
when the user presses this button.

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,610
In this case,
it's the removeMeal method.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,370
So this is the removeMeal method
in the ShowDinnerActivity.

21
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,940
This is the method that gets
clicked when users press the button

22
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,710
to say they don't like a meal.

23
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,870
So this method creates an intent to
start the RemoveMealActivity and

24
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,140
here's where I've added the code
to send a hit to Analytics.

25
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,970
I get the tracker, I build the event.

26
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,050
I've set the category to Dinner actions,
set the action to,

27
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,330
Dislike dinner choice, and here,
I am passing in the selected dinner, so

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,990
that I can keep track of actually which
dinner it is that users don't like.

29
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,790
So to see the report for
the events in the Analytics Dashboard,

30
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,720
you go to Behavior,
Events, and Overview.

31
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,490
While you're waiting for

32
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,650
the data to show up in the Analytics
Dashboard, you can check the log in

33
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:59,930
Android Studio to make sure that
the hits did in fact get sent.

34
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,420
And in the Analytics Dashboard,

35
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,622
in the Events Overview, make sure that
the date range includes today's date.

36
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:09,530
So I actually had to wait about a half
an hour for these events to show up.

37
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,120
But here they are.

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,490
You see the event categories
have only got one category.

39
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,480
You see the actions and
then again I've only got one action.

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,240
And you see the labels.

41
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,190
You can drill down into the events,
drill down into the actions.

42
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:31,550
So here, I can see that the tofu and
coriander salad was the most

43
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,800
disliked with three dislikes and
you can see other data about the event.
