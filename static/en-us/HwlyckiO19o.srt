Based on data from competitors at the expo, Grant thinks that he will sell

00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:08,356
14,000 wiper sets in a month if he lets them cost $20 per set. And he thinks it

00:00:08,356 --> 00:00:12,555
will sell 2000 in a month if he lets them cost $80 each. I'd like you to write

4
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:17,043
an equation in slope-intercept form that relates the number of wiper sets sold

5
00:00:17,043 --> 00:00:21,287
to the price per wiper set. I'd like you to use this information to write an

00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:25,977
equation in slope-intercept form that relates the number of wiper sets sold in a

00:00:25,977 --> 00:00:27,990
month to the price per wiper set.
