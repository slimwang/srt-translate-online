00:00:00,046 --> 00:00:03,790
So one of the GPU computing platforms I'm most excited about is Matlab.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,415
Many of you probably already know about Matlab, especially if you're a scientist or an engineer.

3
00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:11,713
Matlab is a high level programming language and development environment

4
00:00:11,713 --> 00:00:16,105
that's designed for scientific, numeric and mathematical computations.

5
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:19,709
Scientists and engineers use Matlab all the time for algorithm development,

6
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:23,866
data analysis, visualization, and mathematical modeling.

7
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:28,787
Matlab supports GPU computing in a couple of ways by allowing Matlab code to be

8
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:33,419
executed on a GPU, as well as by providing a way to interface with custom CUDA code.

9
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:37,858
We're going to explore these features using an application that fits the theme of this class,

10
00:00:37,858 --> 00:00:40,143
an imaging processing application called white balancing.

11
00:00:40,143 --> 00:00:45,158
The white balance operation is used to adjust the tints of a photograph.

12
00:00:45,158 --> 00:00:47,734
So you can see here, if this is the before image

13
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:50,335
after a white balance operation, it might look like this.

14
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:53,348
And you can see that we've removed the sort of reddish tint from the image.

15
00:00:53,348 --> 00:00:56,863
So this is a simple example of the kind of operation that you might implement in Matlab.

16
00:00:56,863 --> 00:01:02,672
It's easy to implement, as you'll see, and as you'll see, it's also easy to use the GPU as well.
