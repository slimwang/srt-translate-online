00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,110
This is a fairly simple exercise. You're given a program

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,000
that draws two triangles to make a square. Similar to

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,320
how this was done earlier. Back-face culling has been turned

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,820
on, which has caused one triangle to disappear. Your job is

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,790
to determine the problem and fix the triangle's representations so

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,830
that both triangles appear. Here's the method you need to fix.

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,320
You can ignore the material culls at the top and

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,290
the mesh and screen culls at the bottom. The problem has

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,990
to do with the geometry culls here in the middle. By the

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,300
way, in Three.js Back-face culling is turned in by setting the side

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,640
variable in the material. So, here in the Material Creator we set

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,669
side to Frontside, which means that only the front faces are visible.
