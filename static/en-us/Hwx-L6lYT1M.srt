For this last problem, we're going to learn about one more angle relationship,

2
00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:08,931
vertical angles. Vertical angles are directly across from one another. They

3
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:13,413
share a central vertex, and they form Vs. That's how we can remember them. It

4
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:17,870
turns out vertical angles are equal. So if T measures 30 degrees, M must also

5
00:00:17,882 --> 00:00:19,721
measure 30 degrees. Degrees.

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:24,513
This also forces some unique relationships in this diagram. I'm going to see if

7
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:29,209
you can figure them out. If angle M measures 32 degrees, I want you to find the

8
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:32,834
measures of all the other angles. Enter their measures here.
