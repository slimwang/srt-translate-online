00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:01,600
Hey, there!

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,520
Welcome to the content providers lesson.

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,710
Now, in the Android framework,
there are four key app components that

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,870
all developers need to understand to be
truly effective Android app creators.

5
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:16,780
They are activities, services, broadcast
receivers, and content providers.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,720
>> In this lesson,
we're focusing on content providers.

7
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:22,309
Here you'll learn how to use
a pre-existing content provider

8
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:25,019
which is an important skill to
master before building you're own.

9
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,359
>> Now you're probably wondering
what exactly is a content provider?

10
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,629
To start off, we'll talk a little bit
about content providers in general.

11
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:35,519
When to use them, when not too, and
why you'd ever want to create your own.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,990
>> After that you'll learn how to use
a content provider to grab user data

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,230
from your user's phone and
display in an app you build.

14
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:45,329
>> All right, well I'm pretty excited
to talk about data persistence.

15
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,250
Are you excited to talk
about data persistence?

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:47,840
>> Yes.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:47,980
>> Yay!

18
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:48,849
All right.

19
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,289
Let's dive in.
