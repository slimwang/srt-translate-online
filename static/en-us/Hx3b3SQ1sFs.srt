00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,719
So one of the important parts
of code prototypes is that it's

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:08,550
often useful to build out specific
features rather than the whole app.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,290
Our app has a couple of places where
a code prototype might be useful.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,410
We're looking for something where the
behavior might not be clear to a user

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,160
from our initial prototypes.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,240
Along with places where users
are inputting information into the app.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,610
So, what features of our app
should we prototype in code?
