1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,940
So all of these answers look pretty good, but the

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,520
second one is the least compatible with Debbie's persona. If

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,060
she cares about locally grown ingredients or organic ingredients, these

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,560
will probably cost more, and we see here that Debbie doesn't

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,200
have a lot of money. So she's probably going to be

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,600
pretty price conscious. So this is kind of a hard

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,760
one. But in real life, there's oftentimes pretty difficult choices

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,490
to make. So I think B would be the most incompatible.

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:23,780
>> I agree.
