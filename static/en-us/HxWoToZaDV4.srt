1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,039
So let's now actually think
about creating a parametric

2
00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:04,220
representation of it.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,790
Put some variables and
see how those variables change.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,225
Let's basically say that we
are looking for a function P,

5
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:17,013
which is basically the intense
distribution at any point in space.

6
00:00:17,013 --> 00:00:19,870
So P is the intensity
distribution at this point and

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,470
now we'd like to figure
out how that changes.

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,835
Again, just to simplify, we can
always imagine this to be a sphere.

9
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:29,970
So just to look at this now,
how would we parametrize it.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,704
Of course, any point on the sphere,
if i was to traverse it,

11
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:34,380
there are two ways I can traverse it.

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,754
Right?
I can traverse it on the axis of

13
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:42,040
rotation this way, which basically
captures the slice in any direction.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,929
Then of course, force the elevation.

15
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:47,012
The lo, longitude,
latitude kinds of information.

16
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:51,054
So two angles could actually let me
traverse any point of this sphere.

17
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:55,137
So that basically says,
I have two angles, theta and phi.

18
00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:58,603
If I had those two angles if I could
measure at any point here in this

19
00:00:58,603 --> 00:01:01,262
sphere, I could now
traverse this whole sphere.

20
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:02,145
Okay?

21
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:06,079
So from this point on, I basically
need to be able to take any vector and

22
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,095
I have two different angles
that could represent it.

23
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:14,845
So P would be determined by these
two parameters, theta and phi.

24
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:19,338
Now, in the extreme case, let's imagine
this is a huge sphere very far away and

25
00:01:19,338 --> 00:01:20,880
in the infinity.

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,804
Then of course, each and every one
of those regions would be a plane.

27
00:01:24,804 --> 00:01:28,600
Traverse that plane I would actually
just be looking at x and y.

28
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,614
So, in an extreme situation,
we can almost kind of say, as the other

29
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:36,700
parameterization to point out any
information and this way would be,

30
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,595
this as I said was a far away point
on the sphere would be just x and y.

31
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:43,179
So, of course, another parameterization,

32
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:47,304
we looked at in these two dimensions
would be P with the parameters x and y.

33
00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:50,065
Of course, remember,
light has color, has,

34
00:01:50,065 --> 00:01:53,800
which of course is represented
by various wavelengths.

35
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,137
So we need to actually also model that,
which is the wavelength of light.

36
00:01:58,137 --> 00:02:01,505
And of course, as we learn, when we
actually start looking at videos and

37
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:02,345
stuff like that.

38
00:02:02,345 --> 00:02:03,920
Any scenes changes over time and

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,429
we actually interested capturing of
course the dynamics of the scene.

40
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:11,577
Irrespective of captured on video or
not scenes are always changing, so

41
00:02:11,577 --> 00:02:15,130
we need to represent
the time aspect of it too.

42
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,720
So, of course,
now we need to add two more parameters.

43
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,346
Lamba, which is of course is
the wavelength, t which is the time.

44
00:02:22,346 --> 00:02:28,387
We can do it for both the angle
version or the string x and y version.

45
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:32,720
So that's how we would now start
representing a light field.

46
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,637
Let's dig deeper into this one.

47
00:02:34,637 --> 00:02:38,757
So now of course, this point,
the one we're looking at,

48
00:02:38,757 --> 00:02:41,290
also is basically a viewing point.

49
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:41,804
Right?

50
00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:44,001
In the whole 3D world, I have a point,

51
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:47,014
I need to know where the location
of this thing is too.

52
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:49,806
When we talked about where
are two ways of capturing images,

53
00:02:49,806 --> 00:02:52,887
we also said that we need to know
the location of the camera itself.

54
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:55,929
So now the viewing point
is also important, right?

55
00:02:55,929 --> 00:02:59,513
If I view a scene from this point or
that point, things are different.

56
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,900
I need to capture that and
that's another set of parameters.

57
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,429
So we can add those into our function.

58
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:11,845
So now, if you notice we basically have
the orientation of the ray of light.

59
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:16,390
Location of the ray of light in 3D,
lambda colors and frequencies and

60
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,095
stuff like that and time.

61
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:20,849
Again, a similar version for
this could also be generated,

62
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:22,580
where now we basically look at x and y.
