1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,181
If you think about it, the only thing
that we can directly observe is the x,

2
00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:07,970
y coordinate of the target.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,590
Yes, we could try to detect
the pendulum rod or other components,

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,390
but that may not be as reliable.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,470
So, this is the only thing that needs
to be in our measurement model.

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,240
The same x, y location can
serve as our system state.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,615
However, since the motion of
the pendulum is constrained by the fixed

8
00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:30,600
length rod, assuming it is fixed length,
it's better to compress the state.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,200
It really only has one state variable.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,690
That is theta.

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,780
Again, this is assuming that l and
r are constants.

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,750
When analyzing a dynamic system,

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,870
it is very important to identify what
are its real degrees of freedom.

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,830
Sometimes, the state variables
you need to keep track of may

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,930
not be immediately apparent.

16
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,500
We will see examples of
such systems later on.
