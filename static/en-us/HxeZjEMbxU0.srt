1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,330
Even just using orientation and width. We can

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,540
easily place different form factors into a few buckets

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,380
that we can target. Note that using media

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,090
queries, we're defining these buckets in terms of things

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,850
like physical dimensions, width and height. Not in

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,530
terms like for an iPhone 5, do this. This

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,170
strategy, along with the fluid design strategies we

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,830
learned in the last lesson, helps our designs adapt

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,650
to general scenarios, and, new devices as they come along.
