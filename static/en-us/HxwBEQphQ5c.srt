1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,920
We're going to look at a fun example. This is

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,648
me, and I'm going to India for Christmas holidays. And

3
00:00:06,648 --> 00:00:09,765
I'm going to make an airline reservation. I'm going to

4
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:13,140
use Expedia to make the airline reservation. So what I'm

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,320
doing on my computer, I'm sending a message to

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,150
Expedia, saying, hey, make a reservation for me. And Expedia

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,630
chooses to make the reservation using Delta, so it sends

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,480
a message. a to b is a message that I

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,370
sent to Expedia saying I need a ticket to

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,660
go to India, preferences, and so on. Expedia then

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,480
sends a message to Delta booking the reservation that

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,040
I want. Delta confirms by this message, e to

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,420
f, that yes, Kishore's reservation is in. And once

14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,660
Expedia has received this confirmation from Delta, it sends

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,830
me a message, g to h. And this message

16
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,580
is telling me that I've go the airline reservation booked.

17
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,120
So all of these are messages. a to b is

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,120
a message, a is the sending of the message, b is

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,770
the receipt of the message. And c is the sending

20
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:02,020
of the message from Expedia to Delta. e is the confirmation

21
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,220
that my reservation is in from Delta to Expedia and

22
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,530
finally g to h is the message from Expedia to me

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,540
saying that yes, you have your reservation, you can go to

24
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,290
India in December. That's good. And then, what I'm doing is,

25
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,950
I'm directly contacting Delta, message from me, me to

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,200
Delta, asking for my preference for food. Fortunately, it's

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,300
an international trip, so I'm going to get a

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,910
little bit more than peanuts on, on the Delta

29
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,680
flight to India. So I sent a message asking

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,440
for my meal preference and Delta confirms that yes,

31
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,630
you have your meal preference. That's the message k

32
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,480
to l, is the message that confirms that I have

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,350
my meal preference, I'm all set. So everything

34
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,000
that I've described here is what you probably do

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,680
on a routine basis, every time you're making

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,210
any travel plans. Either contacting Expedia or some other

37
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,810
web portal to make your airline reservation. All

38
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,210
of this makes logical sense, right? There are several

39
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,900
beliefs that are ingrained in this picture here

40
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,310
about the ordering of events in the distributed system

41
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,940
that makes all of this work. In particular, when we look at the set of events

42
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,990
that you're seeing here as events that I'm

43
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,840
responsible for, we think that these events are happening

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,500
in sequential order. So for instance, if you

45
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,640
look at what Expedia is doing, it is receiving

46
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,700
my message saying that I want an airline

47
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,870
reservation to be made, does a bunch of bookkeeping.

48
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,660
Then sends this message over to Delta saying that well,

49
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,880
go ahead and make this booking for him, gets the acknowledgement

50
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,440
back from Delta. And then it does a bunch of

51
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,860
other bookkeeping, once it gets the acknowledgement from from Delta and

52
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,820
then it tells me that, okay, you've got it. And

53
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,230
after that, it does some more bookkeeping to say that, well,

54
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,800
you know to show if booking is done and I'm

55
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,210
going to make some internal notes on the details of this booking.

56
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,160
And so those are all things that are happening

57
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,380
as events within Expedia. So the beliefs that we have

58
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,690
is that processes are sequential, that is, the events

59
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,650
that we see happening in a given process, these are

60
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,640
the events that are happening in a given process,

61
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,690
we expects these events to be totally ordered, right? So

62
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,720
for instance, you wouldn't expect given this ordering of

63
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,560
events, that you see in Expedia's profile that this event

64
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,750
m happened before sending this message c. Right?

65
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,410
So that's the mental model that you have,

66
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,110
that events are totally ordered within a single

67
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,980
process, and that's why we're calling process sequential.

68
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,330
That is, the execution of a process is a textual order that you see. At least

69
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,160
the apparent effect of the execution of the

70
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,970
process that you, as a user, experience is sequential.

71
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:55,810
So if I look at this particular process, h happens before i,

72
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:01,270
f happens before g, and d happens before e, so all of these

73
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,740
are things that are ingrained in our mental model of processes being sequential.

74
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,500
The other belief is that you cannot have a

75
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,510
receipt of a message before the send is complete, right?

76
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,960
So you have to send the message before it can

77
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,650
be received. In other words, the receipt of a message,

78
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,910
which is b here, has to happen after

79
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,980
the messages are being sent from here. Similarly, this

80
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,400
message reception f must have happened after the

81
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,840
message was sent from Delta. So those are the

82
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,200
core beliefs that we have about what is

83
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,640
happening with events in a distributed system. That events

84
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,830
within the process are sequential. And across processes,

85
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,090
when you have communication events, send happens before receive.

86
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,090
So these are two core beliefs that we have about the working of

87
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,960
a distributed system. And we call

88
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,619
these beliefs, as they happened before, relationship.
