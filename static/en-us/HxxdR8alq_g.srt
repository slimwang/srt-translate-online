Here's my answer.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,689
This is just a souped up version of
the filtering idea that we saw before.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:09,430
We run the input machine
M on the empty string.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,250
If it loops, then so will N,
and it will accept nothing.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,700
So N is not in the language L.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,364
On the other hand, if M halts,
then N behaves like a machine in

7
00:00:22,364 --> 00:00:27,480
the language returning true if
the input string matches 0 to the n,

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,570
1 to the n and false otherwise.

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,110
In the one case,
the language of N is the empty set.

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,787
In the other case, it is the set
of strings of the form 0 to the n,

11
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:38,481
1 to the n.

12
00:00:38,481 --> 00:00:41,580
And, of course, a decider for
L can tell the difference.
