1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,400
So let's go through each of
these audio focused states.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,948
So for this first one here,
AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN, the description of

3
00:00:06,948 --> 00:00:11,116
this would be that it gains audio focus
back again after having lost it earlier,

4
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:14,500
and what we should we do in our
Miwok app when we enter this state?

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,220
Well we should resume
playing the audio file.

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,400
Now for the second audio focus state,
AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS, a description of it is

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,880
that it's a permanent loss of audio
focus and as it applies to our

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,720
Miwok App, audio focus loss will stop
the MediaPlayer and release resources.

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,480
Now the third state,
AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT, so

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,710
this state temporarily
loses audio focus.

11
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,100
In our Miwok app,
that means we pause the audio file.

12
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:47,580
And in this last audio focus state,
AudioFocus_Loss_Transient_Can_Duck,

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,300
that means a temporary
loss of audio focus.

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,970
And we can duck or
lower volume if applicable.

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,450
In our Miwok app, that means that
we can pause the audio file.

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,990
Remember that each part of the word
pronunciation is important to be heard.
