1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:01,853
It's important that you
use the view holder.

2
00:00:01,854 --> 00:00:05,463
To cache the view objects that you're
going to be populating with data or

3
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:05,944
images.

4
00:00:05,944 --> 00:00:08,387
When the Recycler view is
first being populated.

5
00:00:08,387 --> 00:00:09,762
You call find view by ID for

6
00:00:09,762 --> 00:00:13,269
each view that will be showing
data from the adaptor.

7
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:14,679
This search can be expensive,

8
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:18,050
especially if you have a hierarchy
of views in your list item.

9
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,710
So it's best to do it once and
cache those views in a view holder.

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,260
This way,

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,010
you can access those views later without
having to look them up repeatedly.

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,220
If you don't use a view holder
calling find view by ID for

13
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:31,759
each view can get out
of hand pretty quickly.

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,230
But don't take my word for it.

15
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's try a quiz to
understand it a bit better.
