1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Alright, let's get started.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We see just a 1, and we've seen all of it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Then we totally could be in this state.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
E goes to 1, and then there's my finger. That's where we are.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We've already seen the 1.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We're done with--we're ready to apply this rule, E goes to 1.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Everything here is fine.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Here the input hasn't changed, and we have another state,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but remember that we said before, depending on your point of view,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
when you see a 1 you can either be reducing a 1 to expression

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
or you could be completely done with parsing.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
1 is in the language of this grammar.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We normally think of things like 1 + 2 - 3, but the lowly 1 alone is in this grammar.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
S goes to E. E goes to 1.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And this says, I finished parcing the string. Great!

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now we just see a 1, but this state says, oh, I've seen an E, and I've seen a +,

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and I'm looking for an E in the future.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This can't work because it requires us to have seen the +.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If I put my finger here, the + is in the past, and I haven't seen any +'s in the input,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
so we can't make that work out.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The next one has the same input, but a slightly different state.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I've seen an E, and I'm looking for a + and then another E.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, I could totally imagine a + followed by another E filling this out.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That could work, so this is a possible state that we could be in.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We see 1 + as the input, and this is a little more complicated,

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and now the one that we had to reject before suddenly becomes valid.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
My finger is here, and E and a + are in the past.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Here's the E. Here's the +, and I'm looking for some new expression in the future.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This fits very well.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The last one was a bit of a ringer. This was a bit of a trick question.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It required you to have the definition well in hand.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This looks very promising.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I put my finger here and it says, oh, there's a 1 and a + in the past,

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and we're looking for an E--that all sounds good.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But remember that the definition of a parsing state is that it's one of the rules

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
from our grammar, augmented with a single red dot.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
E goes to 1 + E is not a rule in our grammar.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The closest rule in our grammar is 5, which is E goes to E + E.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Every symbol matters.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This can't be a valid parsing state because E goes to 1 + E is not a rule in our grammar.
