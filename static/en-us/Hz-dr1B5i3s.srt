00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,070
Congratulations. This is really impressive.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,090
You've gotten all the way through the course.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,150
The only thing left is the final, and good luck on that.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,890
Now I'd like to ask you to challenge us to improve this course.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,890
We'd like your help with that.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,830
We'd like you to tell us how you think that we can improve this course,

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,340
and what other topics in theoretical computer science you would like to learn about.

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,350
We have a link to a survey that we'd really appreciate it if you took,

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,540
down below the video in the instructor comments.

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,740
Once you've taken this survey go ahead and check this box,

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,320
and then good luck on the final.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 99:59:59,999
Once again I'd like to thank you for being a part of this course.
