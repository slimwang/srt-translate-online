1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,476
Lets do 3 more examples.

2
00:00:01,476 --> 00:00:06,754
In this example we're switching on the threadIdx.x % 2

3
00:00:06,754 --> 00:00:13,222
and we're launching a single thread block with 1024 threads, 1-dimensional.

4
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:19,649
In this example we're switching on threadIdx.x/32, integer divide.

5
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:22,693
Otherwise the same, 1024 threads, 1-dimensional.

6
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:25,769
And finally, we'll switch on threadIdx.x /8.

7
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:27,878
Now cases range from 0 to 63

8
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:32,680
and again we're going to launch 1024 threads single, 1-dimensional block.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,216
So what is the slowdown for these 3 situations?
