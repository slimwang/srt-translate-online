1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,800
So why do we need to find the lowest common denominator? Well remember that we

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,420
have to find a common denominator in order to add or subtract fractions. In our

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,028
very first example, we needed to have 90th in order to add these two fractions

4
00:00:14,028 --> 00:00:18,772
together. In the second example, we needed to have a common denominator of 2ks

5
00:00:18,772 --> 00:00:23,620
squared in order to add these two fractions together. Once we have a lowest

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,030
common denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator in each

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,159
fraction by the factors that are missing to change our fraction into an

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:38,378
equivalent form. So for 18, it was missing a factor of five. So we multiplied by

9
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:43,086
5 divided by 5. Likewise for the denominator 2 s squared, we multiply this

10
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:49,364
fraction by k over k. Since k is the missing factor. From 2s squared. When we

11
00:00:49,364 --> 00:00:54,100
multiply by k divided by k, we're really multiplying by 1, and we're changing

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,577
our first fraction into its equivalent form. So let's go back to our third

13
00:00:58,577 --> 00:01:03,314
example of finding the LCD. We found the lowest common denominator for these two

14
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:08,100
fractions, and it was p minus 1, times p minus 2, times p plus 3. Remember we

15
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,286
want to change these two fractions to an equivalent form. So here's your

16
00:01:12,286 --> 00:01:16,592
question. What should we multiply each of these fractions by to get an

17
00:01:16,592 --> 00:01:20,753
equivalent fraction with a lowest common denominator of this?
