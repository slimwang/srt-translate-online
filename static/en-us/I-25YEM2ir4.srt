00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,610
It's time to update
the Weather App again.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,470
To store the list of cities that
the user wants to keep track of.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:11,410
Here's what I want you to do, 1, take
a look at a few of the storage libraries

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,575
and pick the one that you
think will work best for you.

5
00:00:14,575 --> 00:00:17,620
I've made some recommendation
in the instructor notes but

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,875
you can use anything you like.

7
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,750
2.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,570
Add a function that will save the list
of cities the user has added and

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,720
hook it up so that it saves
whenever the user adds a city.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,760
Third, update the apps so

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,210
that on start up it checks to see
if the user has any saved cities.

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,600
If it does, get the latest data for
those cities and update the cards for

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,070
those cities.

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,150
If it doesn't,

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:48,980
simulate the server injecting the data
into your app JS file and render that.

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,670
When you've completed this step,
your app should show the weather for

17
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,510
the default city,

18
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,550
for the first time the app loads and
allow the user to ad new cities.

19
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,190
But then when we load it the user
sees a list of cities that

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,280
they want to know about.

21
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,320
Be sure to compare your app to the link
in the instructor notes below and

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,420
make sure it works exactly the same.

23
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,890
And don't forget to try your
app in multiple browsers.

24
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,850
How does it work on Firefox,
Safari, or UC browser?
