1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,890
So here's the URL that we
spoke about in the last video.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,290
And here are the Sign-in button
styles that you can see.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,960
On the right hand side here,
you can see a Download Files link.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,900
And it says that it includes
Sign-In buttons in PNG and

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,810
PSD format in many
different resolutions.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,490
It also includes base,
hover, and pressed states so

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,470
that you can show some animation
as the user clicks on the button.

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:26,950
If you click the Download Files link
a zip file will get downloaded,

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:31,170
and if I open that zip file you'll
see a directory structure like this.

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,150
Here are my sign in assets, and

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,190
in my sign in assets we can
see different drawables.

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,869
So we can see I've buttoned
google_focus, buttoned google_normal,

13
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:41,010
pressed, etc.

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,750
And as I select them you can
actually see the buttons

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,470
here in preview on the Mac.

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:50,923
And it's got them in drawable.hdpi,
mdpi, tvdpi, xdpi, and xxdpi.

17
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:53,690
And you may notice that in
Android Studio you have a very similar

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,970
collection of directories.

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,490
Here under res I have drawable,
drawable-hdpi, drawable-mdpi, etc.

20
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,980
So, all you have to do is copy
the files from the zip folder, into

21
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,150
Android Studio, so that they can become
available to you in Android Studio.

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,880
So here, you can see my drawable-hdpi,

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,330
and I have the different Google
buttons available to me.

24
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,210
So this is the small
button in disabled mode.

25
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,690
This is the small
button in focused mode.

26
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,900
This is the small button in normal mode.

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,440
This is the small button in press mode.

28
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,830
You can see the subtle change in colors.

29
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,970
Similar for the sign in button,
disabled, focused, normal and pressed.

30
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,250
You're going to be using the sign in
button and customizing your app for

31
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,680
the sign in area over
the next few steps.

32
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,750
So go ahead and download the zip file
and then unzip it into Android Studio.

33
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,520
You can work from the same app as
you used in the earlier module, or

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,970
if you prefer, you can create
a new one that's exactly the same.

35
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,850
I've actually created a new one for
this.

36
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,170
But do remember that if you do create
a new one; on the developers console,

37
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,750
you'll have to create credentials for
the new one,

38
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,140
using the naming of the new one or
you won't be able to sign in.
