1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,440
The correct answer is this.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,746
You implement
GoogleApiClient.ConnectionCallbacks,

3
00:00:05,746 --> 00:00:10,180
GoogleApiClient.OnConnectionFailedListe-
ner, and a LocationListener.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,030
It's important to remember
these in your activity.

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,700
If you don't, you'll discover bugs when
you implement the interface functions

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,300
later, because you're writing them in
a class that doesn't support them.
