1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Here we have a scatter plot of the height of adults versus their height as children.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What I'd like you to tell me is whether the standard deviation of adult heights

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
or the standard deviation of children's heights is larger.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check the variable that has the greater standard deviation.
