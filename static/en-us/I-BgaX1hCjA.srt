00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,100
Woo, we made a prototype.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,920
It gave us information we needed.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,360
Well done prototype, you rock.

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,470
Unfortunately, as we said at
the beginning of this lesson,

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,760
prototypes should exist for
exactly as long as they are needed, and

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,725
we don't need you anymore.

7
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:19,090
[SOUND]
And we're done.
