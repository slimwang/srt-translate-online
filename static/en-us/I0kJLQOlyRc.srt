2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,056
This course, software architecture and design, is divided into parts,

3
00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:16,450
each interleaving content lessons within class exercises.

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,070
After a few introductory lessons we will begin by looking at

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,640
the process of analyzing a design problem and specifying it using UML and

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,830
OCL. Both the static and dynamic aspects of analysis will be presented.

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,140
The next part of the course has to do with software architecture.

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,951
This includes different ways of thinking about and representing architectures,

9
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:41,210
the role of non functional requirements in determining architecture, and how

10
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,370
architectural designs can be refined into modules that can then be implemented.

11
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,310
The final part of the course gets into the specifics of software design,

12
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,830
including object design, design patterns, design principles, and design reviews.
