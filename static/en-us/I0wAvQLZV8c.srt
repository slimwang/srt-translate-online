1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,410
If we unfold your brain, okay?

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,390
Which is generally painful, all right?

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,760
What we have to do is we have to sort
of take all this crinkled stuff and

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,770
then open it up and layer it.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,620
What you would see is something
that looks like this.

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,550
And bare with me here, okay?

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,590
What's happened here is,
this here is your eyeball, right there.

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,220
This back area is V1, they're showing,

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,070
this is on the inside,
this is on the outside.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,760
Here's your nose here.

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,610
This is the,
these are your visual cortex areas here.

12
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:37,417
And, if I were to peel it out, so take
this brain and flatten it out, okay?

13
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:41,721
You would get a map that looks something
like this, so this big area here is V1,

14
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:43,750
that's this area back in here.

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,140
It wraps around.

16
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,460
Then there's these other visual areas.

17
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,170
Anything starting with
a v is a visual area.

18
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,350
And then it goes all the way up and

19
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,920
here's that, so this is wrapping
around this whole body, right?

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,090
Here's that somatic sensory,
the feeling.

21
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,240
Here's your motor cortex,
whole bunch of these other areas.

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,500
Okay, this is what you would see.

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,190
All right, but
of course this is just a drawing.

24
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,310
Now I want to show you a picture
that's kind of cool and

25
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,900
kind of gross at the same time,
all right?

26
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,820
And here's what we're going to do,
and again, PETA folks, turn this off.

27
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,970
All right.

28
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,367
You take an animal, a living animal,
you immobilize its eye by giving

29
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:27,875
an injection that prevents the eye
muscles from moving the eye, okay?

30
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,515
You put up a flashing pattern
that's in like some rings,

31
00:01:30,515 --> 00:01:33,815
that alternate sort of bright and
dark spots, and you turn that on, but

32
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:36,950
remember the eye can't move, so
the eye is fixed at the same point.

33
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,545
You then inject essentially a type
of radioactive substance into

34
00:01:43,545 --> 00:01:50,583
the bloodstream that binds with sort
of the oxygenated red blood cells.

35
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:57,140
And the more cells work,
the more oxygen they consume, okay?

36
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,360
So, you can measure, so this is like,

37
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,640
one of the first ways of measuring the
activity of the blood cell, of, of the,

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,790
of the brain cells by,
you have them do this work for a while,

39
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:12,940
while this radioactive tracer's
connected to red blood cells and oxygen.

40
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,719
And what happens is the blood cells
that are doing a lot of work,

41
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,440
build up a lot of this
radioactive material.

42
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,690
But of course, you have to get a picture
of that radioactive material, and

43
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,720
it's a very thin little bit of material,
in a very thin part of the brain.

44
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,100
So what you have to do is what they
refer to as euthanize the animal.

45
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,773
So the animal is, is, killed.

46
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:39,120
You then, very carefully,
un-peel its brain.

47
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,550
And you can take a radiograph,
you can actually measure, you know, you,

48
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,870
you can think of it as simply as
putting the brain, that brain tissue

49
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,860
next to a photographic plate, and
the radioactivity makes an image, okay?

50
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,960
There's a little more to it than that.

51
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,906
When you do that,
you get this remarkable picture, and

52
00:02:54,906 --> 00:02:56,542
this one comes from 1988.

53
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:59,621
So, even though this is sort
of very fundamental work,

54
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:01,333
it's not all that old, okay?

55
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:07,000
And here is what the animal
was looking at, okay?

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,492
It's macaque.

57
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:14,140
All right, so here you can see the, the
visual stimulus the animal's looking at.

58
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,010
And here is the,
the picture of its brain.

59
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:25,110
And what's so cool is that
this structure is preserved.

60
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,070
This is what's referred to
as retinotopic mapping,

61
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,260
is preserved within the cortex, okay?

62
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,090
So, when you move a little bit in the
retina, you move a bit in the cortex.

63
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,680
Now what's also really cool
is that it is not one-to-one,

64
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,180
in terms of, how much cortical area
is devoted to how much of the retina?

65
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,440
In fact, the way it's drawn

66
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,960
out is sometimes referred
to as log polar, et cetera.

67
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,710
And again, this is where we've
unfolded your, your visual field.

68
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,300
And you see that like this little area,
1 2 3 4,

69
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,490
is looking at a lot
on the visual cortex.

70
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:05,130
And this area out here,
okay, is much, much smaller.

71
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:11,010
So you use more brain real estate for
that tiny little area in the middle

72
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,450
of your visual field, than you use
real estate for bigger areas out here.

73
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,810
Which also, I mean, yes,

74
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,760
it makes sense, because that's where
all the processing needs to be.

75
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,500
But the fact that you can actually find
this in the actual tissue is, you know,

76
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,850
in some sense remarkable.
