1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,770
So we have come across this high level architecture for deliberation earlier.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,800
Today we will talk about a specific cognitive architecture for deliberation.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,440
This architecture is called SOAR. I should mention that SOAR not only

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,090
covers deliberation, SOAR can also cover certain aspects of reaction, and some

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,840
aspects of meta cognition. But we are going to focus mostly on the deliberation

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,890
component and so on. SOAR was initiated by Allen Neville, John Lear, and

7
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,750
Paul Rosenbloom. And John Lear and Paul Rosenbloom have been working on it for

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:37,540
the last 30 years or so. The highest level consists of a long term memory and

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,690
a working memory. The [INAUDIBLE] itself contains different kinds of knowledge.

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,700
In particular SOAR talks about three kinds of knowledge. Procedural, semantic,

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,500
and episodic. Episodic knowledge has to do with events.

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,580
Specific instances of events, like, what did you have for dinner yesterday.

13
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,530
Semantic knowledge has to do with generalizations in the form of concepts and

14
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,350
models of the world. For example, your concept of a human being, or

15
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,450
your model of how a plane flies in the air.

16
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,570
Procedural has to do with how to do certain things. So as an example, how do you

17
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,530
pour water from a jug into a tumbler. Notice that this makes an architecture.

18
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,930
There are different components that are interacting with each other.

19
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,210
This arrangement of components will afford certain processes of reasoning and

20
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,550
learning. That's exactly the kind of processes of reasoning and

21
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,320
learning that we'll look at next.
