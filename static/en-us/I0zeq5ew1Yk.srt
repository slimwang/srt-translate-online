00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,230
Okay, now that we have looked at how to
write sentences in the language of logic

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,330
and also looked at how to
rewrite the sentences, for

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,380
example by eliminating implication,
let us now look at

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,780
what kinds of rules of inference can
be implied and how can we apply them.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,570
One rule of inference is
called Modus Ponens, and

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,100
many of you may already
be familiar with it.

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,608
If I'm given a sentence s1
which says p implies q, and

8
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:31,909
another sentence S2 which says p,
then I could infer q from it.

9
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:37,870
p implies q and p, therefore q,
this symbol stands for therefore.

10
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,770
Let's take an example, so imagine that
I'm given that feathers imply bird.

11
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,320
And I'm also given
that feathers is true.

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,130
Then, I can infer that
bird must be true.

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,590
Now we can connect
this to a logic agent.

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,480
Imagine that there is a robot and

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,360
I bootstrap that robot with
the knowledge that feathers imply bird.

16
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,260
Now the robot goes to a new
region in the country and

17
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,550
finds some animal which has feathers.

18
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,200
The robot cannot conclude that
that particular animal is a bird.

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,579
So the first sentence came from
something that I had bootstrapped into

20
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:14,960
the knowledge of the robot.

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,440
The second sentence came from
the percepts of the robot.

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,740
And the third sentence came
from its logical inferencing.

23
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,580
And this is how the robot can,
in fact, go about making sound,

24
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,020
complete inferences that
are guaranteed to be correct.

25
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,820
Here is a second rule of inference,
this is called Modus Tollens.

26
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:40,940
So again I have sentence S1, p implies
q, and I have a second sentence, not q.

27
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,180
And therefore,
I can inference that not p.

28
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,710
So let us take an example
of Modus Tollens.

29
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,460
Imagine that there is a robot
that has been programmed,

30
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,620
bootstrapped with the knowledge
feathers imply bird.

31
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,010
So that's part of its
knowledge base already.

32
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,910
This robot goes to a new country and is
talking to the people in that country,

33
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,430
and the people tell the robot a story
about an animal that is not a bird.

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,300
Therefore the robot may infer that
that animal must not have feathers.

35
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,860
So this is coming from
the knowledge that is bootstrapped.

36
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,450
This is coming from the new
percept from the story.

37
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,900
And this is coming from
the logical inference.

38
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,610
And once again, the logical inference
is guaranteed to be sound and complete.

39
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,470
>> You may already be familiar with
this line of reasoning because this is

40
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,730
another way of phrasing
a contrapositive,

41
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,120
that we see in other areas of logic.
