00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,720
If you're already sold on progressive
web apps, and you don't need to make

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,240
a business case for them,
you can probably skip this video.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,036
But if you need to convince one of those
business decision makers, stay tuned.

4
00:00:13,036 --> 00:00:17,390
The Web is an amazing platform
that has easy access for

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,540
developers and users alike.

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,700
It's low friction,
provide easy distribution,

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,308
offers immediate redeployment and
enables simple AB testing.

8
00:00:28,308 --> 00:00:32,490
When Flipboard launched on the web for
the first time this year,

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:38,160
they reported that their monthly
active users increased by 75%.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,080
On the Web, users can get to
a new site with a single tap.

11
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,950
Apps can be a bit more limited.

12
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,480
In many countries, app installation
happens when you buy the phone.

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,870
Three or four apps are side-loaded
at the outset, and that's it.

14
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,900
In other countries,
you may have access to an app store, but

15
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,900
over the air data is expensive and
wi-fi can be difficult to find.

16
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,750
Downloading and updating apps
can be a significant challenge.

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,770
Even in North America and Europe,
many users by multiple app

18
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,630
when they get a new phone, then the
purchases trickle off to almost nothing.

19
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,610
When a user clicks on a link in
the browser, they don't have to make any

20
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:27,050
heavy weight choices up front, and they
don't implicitly sign up for anything.

21
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,130
Progressive web apps, are just websites
that took all the right vitamins.

22
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,630
They add new capabilities, like being
top level in the task switcher, or

23
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,040
on the home screen, and
in the notification tray.

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,326
Beyond the Rack, who recently
added push notifications saw

25
00:01:45,326 --> 00:01:50,250
a 72% increase in time spent and a 26%

26
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,140
increase in average spend per visit for
users arriving via push notifications.

27
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,700
And repeat visits went
up by more than 50%.

28
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,500
Flip Cart, India's largest e-commerce
company switched from an app

29
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,905
only strategy to launch Flip Cart Light,
a progressive web app.

30
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:16,650
63% of Flip Cart Light users
reach the site via 2G network.

31
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,310
So a fast user experience was essential.

32
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,370
To decrease load times Flip Cart
added service workers and

33
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,510
streamlined the site to
help consumers quickly

34
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,250
reach the product they were looking for
by using three times less data.

35
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,360
Users can even continue
to browse categories,

36
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,340
review previous searches, and
view products all while offline.
