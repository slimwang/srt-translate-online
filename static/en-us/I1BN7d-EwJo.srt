1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,660
Since we rounded to the nearest 10th of a foot, our gasoline height, our level,

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,981
would be 2 and 7 10ths of a foot. Amazing work if you found that one. We start

3
00:00:08,981 --> 00:00:13,076
setting up out proportion by looking at the number of gallons, the height, and

4
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:17,400
the square of the radius. We know the number of gallons varies directly with the

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,479
height of the gasoline level and the square of the radius. Since it varies

6
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:25,637
directly with these two amounts, we want to make sure we list those both in the

7
00:00:25,637 --> 00:00:29,884
numerator. And the square part is really tricky. You want to make sure that you

8
00:00:29,884 --> 00:00:33,916
square this radius. Once we have this proportion we can plug in the values for

9
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:38,600
each case and solve for the unknown. In one case the tank has a radius of five

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,755
feet, so we plug in five here. It holds 4,700 gallons, here and has a height of

11
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:49,086
eight feet. So the height one is eight. In the second case, we're looking for

12
00:00:49,086 --> 00:00:54,207
the height of the gasoline level so that will be H. At some unknown height, H,

13
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:59,016
the radius will be four feet, so the second radius is four. And the number of

14
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:03,741
gallons that the tank will hold will be 1000. So gallons 2 is 1000. Now, we want

15
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:09,739
to solve this equation for h. We square the 5 and the 4 to get 25 divided by 16.

16
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:14,798
Next, we multiply these 2 fractions together to get 200 in the numerator, and

17
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:19,060
16h in the denominator. We cross multiply to get this equation. And then,

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,514
finally, we divide by the coefficient of x to get our final answer. We get a

19
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:27,640
decimal for our answer and we want to round to the nearest tenth. Because the

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,838
value next to the 6/10 is a 5 we round up. If this value was less then a 5 then

21
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:38,217
we round down and keep our answer as 2 and 6/10th. But for 5 or greater we round

22
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:43,516
up so we get 2 and 7/10. This is the level for our gasoline take that holds a

23
00:01:43,516 --> 00:01:46,688
thousand gallons and has a base rate of 4 feet.
