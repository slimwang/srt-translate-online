1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,609
So now you're going to go ahead and

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:04,420
create the new composite indexes. So first of

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:09,940
all, open datastore-indexes-auto.xml. You may find it's blank.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,690
You may find it's got some content in it

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,730
already. Either way, it's fine. Then, run the

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,330
query on localhost. Then go back to Eclipse

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,620
and check the datastore-indexes-auto.xml file and you should

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,560
find that the new composite index has been automatically

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,090
added to it. Now that you've updated the

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,310
index file, go ahead and deploy your app

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,740
to appspot. In the developers console, go ahead

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,453
and look in the Index Viewer. Is your

13
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,430
new composite index preparing? You might find that

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,500
it's already ready and that's just fine if

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,340
it is. When your index is ready, run the query and make sure that it works.
