1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,520
As we saw in the spec runner page,
the use of describe and it, are to

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,520
create sort of an outline, as if they
are just used to organize information.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,890
In fact,
that's exactly what they are for.

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,660
It, is used to identify a specification,
or a spec, for short.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,780
A spec is just a container for a test.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,730
A way to identify the exact
feature we're testing.

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,960
For example,
it should be able to play a song.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,270
If all of the expectations within a spec
return true, then that spec passes.

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:36,380
If any of these expectations were to
return false, the spec would fail.

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,600
You could think of it as defining
the boundary around this test.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,010
Describe is used to identify a suite,
which is a group of related specs.

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,820
In this case, the suite is called
"Player", which tells us that everything

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,055
contained within this block
is related to the player.

14
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:57,005
There's no right or
wrong way to organize your tests.

15
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:59,125
It's up to you and your preference.

16
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,695
Describe is just there to
provide an organizational tool,

17
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,235
a level of indentation.
