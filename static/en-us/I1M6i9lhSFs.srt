00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,670
Congratulations, you have
seen how one problem,

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,300
satisfiability, captures all of the
complexity of the P versus NP problem.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,430
An efficient algorithm for
satisfiability when imply P equals NP.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,610
If P is different from NP, then it
can't be any efficient algorithm for

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,230
satisfiability.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,010
Satisfiability has efficient algorithms
if, and only if, P equals NP.

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,560
Steve Cook,
professor of the University of Toronto,

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,290
presented his theorem on May 4, 1971,
at the symposium on the the theory of

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,500
computing at the then Stouffer's Inn
in Shaker Heights, Ohio.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,420
But his paper didn't have an immediate
impact as a satisfiability problem

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,919
was mainly of interest to logicians.

12
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,577
Luckily a Berkeley professor,
Richard Karp, also took interest, and

13
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:44,509
realized that you use satisfiability
as the starting point.

14
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:47,827
If you can reduce satisfiability
to another NP problem,

15
00:00:47,827 --> 00:00:50,465
then our problem must
be NP complete as well.

16
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:54,375
Karp did exactly that, and a year
later he published his famous paper,

17
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,984
Reducibility Among
Combinatorial Problems,

18
00:00:56,984 --> 00:01:01,746
showing that 21 well-known combinatorial
search problems were also MP complete,

19
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:03,526
including the clique problem.

20
00:01:03,526 --> 00:01:07,505
Today tens of thousands of problems
have been shown to be MP complete.

21
00:01:07,505 --> 00:01:11,145
The ones that come up the most often are
practiced tend to be closely related to

22
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:12,980
one of Karp's originals.

23
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,760
In the next lesson, we'll examine
some of the reductions that prove

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,010
these classic problems to be MP complete
and try to convey a general sense for

25
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,280
how to go about finding such reductions.

26
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,380
This sort of argument might come in
handy if you need to convince someone

27
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,370
that a problem isn't as easy
to solve as they might think.
