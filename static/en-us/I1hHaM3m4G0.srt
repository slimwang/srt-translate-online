1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So now, we have an equation that can be implemented on the computer.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's start by simulating the following situation.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A wire is briefly heated by a candle so that some part of the wire is at the temperature of the flame

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and the rest of the wire is at room temperature is times zero

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We blow out the candle so that there's no more heating

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and then we watch heat conduction in action.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
How does this energy spread to the left and to the right.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The code comes with some pretty fine constants for your convenience.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It provides to erase one with the old temperatures at the beginning of the step

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and one for the new temperatures at the end of the step.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And you have to compute the new temperature from the old temperatures

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
for the compartment number i

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
A note about the implementation in case you're wondering about this line here,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
we're exchanging the roles of these two arrays temperatures new,

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
temperatures old after every step.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Once the new temperatures have been computed, they become the old temperatures for the next step,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
which means that one of these arrays can be reused for the new, new temperatures if you will.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This saves us from using tons of arrays. We're just using these two arrays with different roles.
