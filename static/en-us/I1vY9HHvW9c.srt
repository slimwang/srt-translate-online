1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,890
So, what's really great about Pig is that it abstracts

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:07,450
away from the user the actual implementation of how the

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,610
calculation is done. So, you can write in a more

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:15,070
abstract language what kinds of operations should be performed to

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,730
your data. You can say, for example, join this data

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,980
set to this data set, or filter out this data

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,470
set, or reduce this data. But you're not telling it

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,930
how to do the analysis. And then Pig can decide

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,300
the fastest way to do it for you. So instead of having to write

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,600
very detailed jobs describing exactly what should

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,310
be done, you can just specify in an

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,630
abstract sense the calculation that needs to be done, and you can let the

13
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,550
computer do the hard work of figuring out the faster way to do the calculation.
