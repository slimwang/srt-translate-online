00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,795
Since on our table, x varies from negative 3 to 3, we need to make sure that

2
00:00:04,807 --> 00:00:09,900
whatever we pick over here contains all those values. 0 to 10 and negative 10 to

3
00:00:09,912 --> 00:00:14,933
0 are both out, and although negative 20 to 10 does contain all of these values,

4
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:20,016
it's way bigger than this set, so I think the best choice is from negative 5 to

5
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:25,015
5. Our y values range from negative 14 to 4, which makes negative 20 to 10 the

6
00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:26,844
only choice that works for y.
