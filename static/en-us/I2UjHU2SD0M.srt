00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[ Quiz: What does s, t = t, s do? ]

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, the answer is, it actually swaps the value of "s" and "t."

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is quite convenient,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and the important reason for that is

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
both the values on the right side get evaluated first--

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
to get turned into their values--

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
before we do any of the assignments.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So, what's going on:

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
"s" refers to some value--

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
let's call that "alpha"--

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and "t" refers to some value--

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
we'll call that "beta."

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is before the assignments.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
To evaluate the multiple assignment expression,

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
we find the value of "t" here [indicating the second "t" in the expression]--

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that has the value of "beta"--

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and we find the value of "s"--

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and "s" has the value of "alpha."

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We've evaluated both of these,

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and we've turned them into the values the names refer to;

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and, now we do the assignments.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So, "s" will be changed to refer to the first value--

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
which is "beta" Ã¢ÂÂ

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and "t" will be changed to refer to the second value.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This has very different behavior

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
than if we did two assignments like this;

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
so, if we tried, instead, doing "assign t to s,"

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and then "assign s to t,"

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that wouldn't swap the values,

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
because, by the time we do the second assignment,

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
the value of "s" has changed--

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
now it refers to whatever the value of "t" was.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If we had done these two statements {indicating "s = t" and "t = s"],

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
both of them would end up having the value "beta."
