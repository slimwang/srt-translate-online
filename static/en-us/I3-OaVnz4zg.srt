00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,430
One bad pattern that some mobile developers got into

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,820
was detecting if touch was supported on the device, and

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,840
if so, only supporting touch, not adding the mouse

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,720
handlers at all. That's a bad idea. If you do

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,590
this, my Chromebook Pixel will only get touch support

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,480
and the trackpad won't work. Instead, you want touch support

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,000
to be purely additive, like this. Notice, that the

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,020
mouse handlers are still added, even if touch is supported.
