1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,588
The most basic parabola has the equation y equal x squared. Now, we can tell

2
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:09,548
that the center, or really the vertex of this parabola is at the origin, 0

3
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:15,075
comma 0. The parabola opens in the upward direction, and it has an a value of

4
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:20,300
1. The a value is simply the number that's in front of the x squared term.

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,610
Since it's not listed, we know that the coefficient is a 1. Another interesting

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,604
part about parabolas is that they're symmetric. If there's a point on the left

7
00:00:29,604 --> 00:00:32,868
hand side of the graph, then there's another point equally distant away from

8
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:38,665
its axis of symmetry on the right hand side of the graph. For example, we have

9
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:42,889
the point negative 3, 9. Then, on the other side of the graph, we have the

10
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:48,403
point 3 comma 9. We also have the point negative 2, 4. And on the right side of

11
00:00:48,403 --> 00:00:53,108
the graph, we also have the point 2 comma 4. Two units in the horizontal

12
00:00:53,108 --> 00:00:57,520
direction right, and then four units vertically up. The lowest point, or the

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,520
turning point for our parabola, is the vertex. It's at the origin, 0 comma 0.

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,168
Now we could make an x and y table and create a table of values to get our

15
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:12,140
graph. But an easier way to get a couple points on the graph is to look at the

16
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:18,406
a value. We're going to zoom in on this parabola. We can find the basic shape

17
00:01:18,406 --> 00:01:22,838
of this parabola by looking at the a value. The points to the left and to the

18
00:01:22,838 --> 00:01:28,851
right of the vertex will be exactly 1 unit above the current point. So we move

19
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:36,930
one unit left, and one unit up. We move one unit up since the a value is one.

20
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,260
And then to get the symmetric point, we move in the opposite direction. One

21
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:46,648
unit right, and one unit up. So, we can see that we have a point of negative 1

22
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:52,000
comma 1, and a point of 1 comma 1. Let's make another graph and see some

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,702
comparisons. For the graph y equals 2x squared, we also get a parabola. This

24
00:01:57,702 --> 00:02:03,504
parabolas vertex is at the origin, its still 0 0. But what's different the a

25
00:02:03,504 --> 00:02:09,419
value. Now the a value is 2. So to get the basic shape of this graph, we'll

26
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:15,865
move 1 unit 3 and 1 unit left from the vertex. Then we'll go a units up in this

27
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:23,114
case 2 units. So 1 unit left and 2 units up. This gives us our first point at

28
00:02:23,114 --> 00:02:28,940
negative 1, 2. Then we can move 1 unit right. And 2 units up to give ourselves

29
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:35,687
another at 1, 2 and here is a 3rd parabola y equals 3x squared. Notice that the

30
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:41,008
turning point of the vertex where this parabola is still at 0,0, the origin. To

31
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:45,450
find other points on this purple parabola we're going to use our a value. We

32
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:54,900
can move 1 unit left and 3 units up. This gives us coordinate of negative 1, 3.

33
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,052
To find another point on the graph, we'll go the opposite way. We'll go 1 unit

34
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:05,218
right, and this time 3 units up. This gives us a point of 1 comma 3. The a

35
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:10,120
value is always a quick way to get 1 point that is to the left of the vertex.

36
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,585
And 1 point that is to the right of the vertex whenever parabola is in the form

37
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:19,054
of y equals. Notice 2 that as the a value gets bigger our parabola stretches

38
00:03:19,054 --> 00:03:22,600
vertically or in other words it gets more narrow.
