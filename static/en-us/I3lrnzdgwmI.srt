1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Male narrator] So we move on, we look for another shortest path.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There's one path left of length 1, so we look at that path, we expand it,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
add in this path, put that one on the explored list,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and now we've got 3 paths of length 2.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We choose 1 of them, and let's say we choose this one.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now, my question is show me which states we add to the path

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and tell me whether we're going to terminate the algorithm at this point

8
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
because we've reached the goal or whether we're going to continue.
