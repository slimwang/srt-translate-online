1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And the answer is the mean will double and so with the standard deviation.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
To see put this again into our formula using our original mean, and now we realize

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that the new salaries x' are twice the x salaries or put differently x will be a half of x'.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If I substitute this into the formula over here, I get the same exponential expression,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but now with half x' where the x used to be.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now the trick is to deal with the half and that's more complicated than our case before.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The very first thing is I have to bring the half out of the parenthesis over here and there's a trick

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
whereby I rewrite 70,000 as a half of a 140,000 and you can see where this is going.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
With that, I can now bring the half out of the square over here, which gives me a quarter,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
you have to square the half with x'-140,000)²/10,000²

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and now, all I have to do is I have to bring the quarter into the 10,000.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So quarter up here is the same as a 4 down here.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Now, you have to bring it inside the square, so we have to take the square root

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
so it ends up to be the same as the new 2, the square of 2 into the square over here.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So this transformation shows that doubling the salary doubles the µ but also doubles the σ.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It doubles the standard deviation of those salaries--I've proven it to you.
