1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,630
Hey what you working on?

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,420
>> Yeah, I'm having some
trouble deciding what to do

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,625
about the Udacity app rewrite.

4
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:10,450
>> Ooh, are you going to rewrite
the Udacity app in Swift?

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,420
>> You know,
I do code more quickly in Swift, but

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,760
rewriting the entire app
would be a lot of work.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,690
On the other hand, I don't really want
to write new features in Objective C.

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,310
>> Did someone say Objective C?

9
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,680
Objective C is so dynamic.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,430
Doesn't make you feel like you
have more power as a developer?

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,043
>> Yeah, that's true.

12
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:30,660
>> But Swift is a more
modern concise language and

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,680
it probably improve performance.

14
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,932
>> Yeah, that's true too.

15
00:00:35,932 --> 00:00:37,432
The more I think about it,

16
00:00:37,432 --> 00:00:40,444
I think the best move might
be to try to use them both.

17
00:00:40,444 --> 00:00:43,208
>> Hmm, but Objective C and
Swift are so different.

18
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,730
How are we going to get
them talking to each other?

19
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:55,730
>> [MUSIC]

20
00:00:57,983 --> 00:00:59,498
>> You say, inum and I say, inam.

21
00:00:59,498 --> 00:01:02,076
You say, dynamic and I say, static.

22
00:01:02,076 --> 00:01:06,200
Inum, inam, dynamic, static,

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,192
let's call the whole thing off.

24
00:01:10,192 --> 00:01:14,218
You say, giffy and I say, jiffy.

25
00:01:14,218 --> 00:01:18,363
You call a function and I say a message.

26
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:24,730
Giffy, jiffy, function, message,
let's call the whole thing off.

27
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:31,070
>> But, if we call the whole thing off.

28
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,130
>> You lose foundation.

29
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,910
>> And if we ever part,

30
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,414
then that might break my app.

31
00:01:41,414 --> 00:01:43,071
[MUSIC]

32
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:47,659
So if I liked type arrays and
you liked untyped,

33
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,707
I'll take them untyped
with optional casting, for

34
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:59,034
we know we need each other so
we better call the calling off, off.

35
00:01:59,034 --> 00:02:03,116
Let's master.

36
00:02:03,116 --> 00:02:04,861
>> You say, care.

37
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:07,138
>> And you say, car.

38
00:02:07,138 --> 00:02:08,926
>> I like to swizzle.

39
00:02:08,926 --> 00:02:11,168
>> And I do not swizzle.

40
00:02:11,168 --> 00:02:12,026
>> Care.

41
00:02:12,026 --> 00:02:12,766
>> Car.

42
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,144
>> Swizzle.

43
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,203
>> No swizzling.

44
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:18,419
>> Let's call the whole thing off.

45
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:18,963
[MUSIC]

46
00:02:18,963 --> 00:02:27,166
But if we call the whole thing
off- You'd loose core data.

47
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:35,122
And if we ever part then
that might break my app.

48
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:39,639
So if I pass you value,
would you want some warning?

49
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:43,786
>> You can use annotations.

50
00:02:43,786 --> 00:02:47,392
>> For we know we need each other so

51
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:51,847
we better call the calling off, off.

52
00:02:51,847 --> 00:02:56,042
Let's master.

53
00:02:56,042 --> 00:03:02,964
Let's master.
