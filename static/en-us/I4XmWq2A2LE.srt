00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
By now you have seen all kinds of models based on differential equations

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and all kinds of tricks to solve them on the computer.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
If that was all there is to it,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
thousands of phD students would be jobless.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In this final unit, we'll touch upon more advanced topics

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
such as modeling buildings and air and water.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We'll explore why it's hard to predict the weather,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and we'll look into aspects of software engineering,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that is, how to do computer simulations in a proficient way.
