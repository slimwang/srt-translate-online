1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,740
That's the basic HTTP request, now let's talk

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,460
a little about HTTP responses. Let's talk about where

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,040
we are first. You've got you and your machine

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,290
and you've got these servers. Your browser makes a

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,690
request to the servers, and your server sends

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,150
back the response. We talked about the requests already,

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,250
and the server responds with, a response, the document

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,230
that you requested or, you know, information about the

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,280
document depending on what you requested. A basic HTTP response

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,235
looks actually very similar to the request. For a basic

11
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:34,656
request that looks like this, the response might look something

12
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:38,250
like this. Okay, so we can see a couple easy

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,970
things. First of all the stat, this is called the

14
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,690
status line. And this is analogous to the request line

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,640
we had over here. Now the version of the status

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,380
line matches the version of the request line, and then

17
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,310
it's followed by two other pieces of information. One is

18
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,160
the status code and the other is the reason phrase. And

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,600
this is just an English language description of the status

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,092
code. There are some really common status codes and I'll I'll

21
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:05,892
show you some of them here. 200 OK, that means,

22
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:08,674
the document is found. This is a far and away the

23
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:11,695
most common status code on the internet and hopefully we'll be

24
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:15,675
seeing a lot of these. 302 found that means the document

25
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:19,990
is located somewhere else. 404 not found you've probably seen

26
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,419
this one a lot, this means the document wasn't found.

27
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,250
And 500 server error, that means the server broke trying

28
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,110
to handle your request. Unfortunately we will probably also be

29
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,450
seeing a fair number of these in our adventures in

30
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,720
this course. Status codes basically begin with one, two, three,

31
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,400
four or five. If it begins with a two, it

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,740
basically means success, if it begins with a three, it basically

33
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,450
means we need to do something different

34
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,046
technically to find this document. Four means there

35
00:01:45,046 --> 00:01:47,890
is an error on the browser side,

36
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,890
requesting a document that doesn't exist, for example,

37
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,420
and five means there's an error on

38
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,488
the server side, such as, the server's broken.

39
00:01:56,488 --> 00:01:59,990
Okay, let's let's move on a little bit and talk a little more about responses.
