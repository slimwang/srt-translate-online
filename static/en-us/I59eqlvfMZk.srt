Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,570
So we've been discussing sets and
groups in Tablo and

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,020
they have a lot of commonalities but
they also have a lot of differences.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,760
So I was wondering if you could
explain to us the differences

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,570
between sets and groups?

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,210
&gt;&gt; Sure, that's a good question and

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,700
it's something that a lot of
people get confused about.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,630
So a set is a subset of your data

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,790
that meets a certain condition or
criteria based on existing dimensions.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:32,790
So for example, it might be your top
five most profitable food items.

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,830
Whereas a group consists
of dimension members that

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,820
form together to build
a higher level category.

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,730
So it might be breakfast
items that is the group.

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,850
And the items would be coffee,
bagels, and donuts.

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,960
&gt;&gt; Thanks, I know that's something
that I've had a lot of problems with.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,880
And the way you explained it helps
me understand a little better.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,380
&gt;&gt; Great.
