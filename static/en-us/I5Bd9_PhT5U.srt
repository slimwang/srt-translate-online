00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,512
Okay, we've covered a lot of math so far. We've done fractions, we've worked

2
00:00:03,524 --> 00:00:07,120
with multiplying, dividing, adding and subtracting them. Let's try something

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,779
new. Have you ever wondered why your skin cells get replaced? The skin cell's on

4
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:14,315
the top of your hand end up getting replaced. Eventually they die off and they

5
00:00:14,327 --> 00:00:18,287
just flying away. You don't ever see them disappear, but they get replaced by

6
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:22,132
newer cells underneath the top layer of your skin. So here's what it would look

7
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:25,737
like for one cell to replicate. So let's start with one cell, and see what

8
00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:29,395
happens. One cell is going to split into two cells. It's going to double. I have

9
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:33,237
one cell, and another cell. Then, each of these cells are also going to double.

10
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:37,333
This one will make two cells, and this one will make two cells. And then these

11
00:00:37,345 --> 00:00:41,298
four cells will also split. Each one will make two new cells. So here's my

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,474
question. How many cells will there be after seven rounds of division. By the

13
00:00:45,486 --> 00:00:49,684
this segment, you'll be able to answer this question. We're going to figure this

14
00:00:49,696 --> 00:00:53,910
out using exponents. Okay, this is just one cell. This is before any rounds of

15
00:00:53,922 --> 00:00:57,984
division, so I'm going to mark that off with a zero. This is after the first

16
00:00:57,996 --> 00:01:02,435
round of division. I have 2 cells. And then after the second round of division,

17
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:06,937
I have 4 cells. And then, after the third round of division, I have 8 cells. I

18
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:10,470
know my cells doubled every time, so I'm going to use a base of 2. Okay.

19
00:01:10,473 --> 00:01:14,829
I know I started with one cell, and that cell doubled. So I have 1 times 2.

20
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:19,676
Then, each of these cells also doubled. So I have. 2 cells doubling or 2 times

21
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:24,374
2. Then I have 4 cells, each of these 4 cells also doubled, so I have 2 times 2,

22
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,972
those are my 4 cells and then they're going to double. There's got to be an

23
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:33,470
easier way to write this. we're going to actually do this using exponents.

24
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:38,787
Notice that all of my multiplication has a 2. 2 is going to be my base. After

25
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,491
the first doubling, I have 2 to the 1 or two cells. After the second doubling I

26
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:49,996
have 2 to the 2 or four cells. And after 3 rounds of doubling, I have 2 to the

27
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:55,335
3, or 8 cells. And after 3 rounds of doubling I have 2 to the 3rd or 8 cells.

28
00:01:55,455 --> 00:02:01,192
Repeated multiplication is represented by an exponent. It's very similar to

29
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:06,302
repeated addition, like, 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3. I know I have four 3's, or 4

30
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:11,491
times 3. We use multiplication to represent repeated addition. We're going to

31
00:02:11,503 --> 00:02:17,136
use exponents to represent repeated multiplication. So, whenever I have repeated

32
00:02:17,148 --> 00:02:22,127
multiplication, I can write the base. Raised to an exponent. So whenever I have

33
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:25,675
repeated multiplication, I can have the base raised to an exponent.
