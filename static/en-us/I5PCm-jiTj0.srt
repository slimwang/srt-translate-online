1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,850
This first option might look tempting and in fact the null hypotheses is

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,396
correct. But one problem with ANOVA is that we can only tell if at least one

3
00:00:08,396 --> 00:00:14,338
pair is significantly different. That's what makes our statistic big. We have

4
00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:18,876
one statistic that's either big or small. If we get a small statistic, we know

5
00:00:18,876 --> 00:00:23,036
that the within subject variability is large relative to the between subject

6
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:29,220
variability. And none of the means are significantly different from each other.

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,884
In that case, we would accept the null hypothesis. But if we get a large

8
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:38,870
statistic, the opposite is true. The between subject variability is large.

9
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,834
Relative to the within subject variability. In other words we might have some

10
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:46,492
samples, and the means are different from each other, relative to each

11
00:00:46,492 --> 00:00:52,488
variability. But then we know that at least one pair of means is significantly

12
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:58,330
different. So we accept the alternative hypothesis. But we don't know which

13
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,993
means are causing this large between subject variability. This means that when

14
00:01:02,993 --> 00:01:06,753
we're doing ANOVA, if we get a large test statistic and reject the null.

15
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:09,987
There's an extra step that involves seeing which means are different from each

16
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:15,820
other. These follow-up tests are generally called multiple comparison tests.

17
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,040
And you'll learn about these in the next lesson.
