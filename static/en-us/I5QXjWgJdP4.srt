I think the best way to followup with
somebody you met at a networking event

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,000
that made an impression is, of course,
send them a thank you email.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,280
But it's really about finding that
one thing you spoke about in your

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,540
conversation that you want to mention
again in that email that would

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,460
make this email specific and

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,680
not a generic email that the person
thinks you sent out to everyone.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,900
I think also having an action
item is a great thing.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,150
Perhaps, following up with a coffee
chat or a Skype call or maybe you talked

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,240
about an interesting topic and if this
followup email will include an article

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,770
about this or something that
you wrote or found recently.

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,510
Trying to make a connection after
the event is just as important,

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,250
if not more important,
than the connection in the event
