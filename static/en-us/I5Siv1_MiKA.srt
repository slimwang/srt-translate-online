1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,953
But what if we wanted to add these 2 fractions together? What do you think we

2
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:08,189
could do? Well, adding these 2 rational expressions together is very similar to

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,976
adding 2 fractions together. If the denominators are different, we need to

4
00:00:11,976 --> 00:00:16,344
change each fraction. By finding the lowest common denominator first. We know

5
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:20,434
the lowest common denominator would be 90, the product of these factors. We

6
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:25,501
multiply 1 10th by nine over nine, which is the missing factor from ten. 1 10th

7
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:31,798
by 9 9ths is 9 90ths. For 1 18th we multiply by five over five. This is the

8
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:37,968
missing factor for 18. So 1 18th time 5 5ths is 5 90ths. Now we add these 2

9
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:44,229
fractions just as we learned before. 9 plus 5 equals 14 and we have 14 90ths.

10
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:48,789
These numbers are both even and so we can reduce them by 2. So these are a

11
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:50,223
couple of fractions.
