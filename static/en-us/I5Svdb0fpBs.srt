00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It is easy to see that these three states over here, a1 to a3, you want to go east.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In the state a4 up here, you wish to go south.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In b2 you with to go north so as to not risk the 0.2 probability of falling into -100.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In b3 it's perfectly fine to go east.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In the worst case you find yourself in b2,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
in which case you can safely escape the -100 by going north,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
turn right again, and go down over here.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the correct set of answers over here.
