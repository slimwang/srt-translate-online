1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:06,360
The hypotenuse is 25, the longer leg is 20, and the shorter leg is 15 units.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,059
Great work for finding those three numbers. For a squared we'll have x minus 5

3
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:15,151
squared, for b squared we'll have x squared and for c squared we'll have the

4
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:21,525
quantity x plus 5 squared. Keep in mind a and b are the legs, and c is our

5
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:26,104
hypotenuse. Now we have one equation with one variable, which means we can

6
00:00:26,104 --> 00:00:31,392
solve. Squaring the quantity x minus 5, we get x squared minus 10x plus 25, and

7
00:00:31,392 --> 00:00:37,702
squaring the quantity x plus 5 squared, we get x squared plus 10x plus 25. This

8
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:42,163
x squared just comes straight down here. Next, we'll add like terms on the left

9
00:00:42,163 --> 00:00:47,922
hand side of our equation to get 2x squared minus 10x plus 25. The right hand

10
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:51,738
side of our equation stays the same. And since we have a quadratic equation, we

11
00:00:51,738 --> 00:00:54,987
want to move all of these terms to the left hand side so that we can get a

12
00:00:54,987 --> 00:01:00,480
quadratic expression set equal to 0. We move each of these terms to the other

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,634
side of the equation by subtracting the appropriate amount. We'll subtract x

14
00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:11,126
squared, subtract 10x, and subtract 25 from both sides of the equation. We do

15
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:15,720
this so that with the x squared term remains positive, and then we can factor.

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,928
This leaves us with x squared minus 20x equals 0. We can factor an x from these

17
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:27,264
two terms since it is the greatest common factor. So, of x times the quantity x

18
00:01:27,264 --> 00:01:34,680
minus 20. We set each factor equal to 0. And then we solve for x. X can equal 0

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,191
or x can equal positive 20. Since we know we're talking about the side length

20
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:46,126
the longer leg must be 20. The 0 doesn't make sense in this case. So our longer

21
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:51,946
leg will be 20, our hypotenuse will be 5 more which is 25. And our shorter leg

22
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,711
will be five less which is 15.
