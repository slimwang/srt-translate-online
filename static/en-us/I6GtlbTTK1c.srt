00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,690
Next up, we've got dot notation for

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,550
objects, which we just used to access bio.name.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,680
Dot notation allows us to declare an object, and

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,210
then define its properties outside the curly braces.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:19,090
>> The syntax looks like so, we'll have object.someproperty=somevalue.

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,210
>> For instance, bio.email equals my email address.

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,440
>> Hey, I see we didn't use var.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,020
>> Nope, with dot notation, there's no need to use var.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,030
We're adding properties to an object, not creating new variables.

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,130
>> Right, and then we'll access them the same way we did before.

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,280
>> Yep, we can use dot notation to access properties and

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,850
append them to the page.

13
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,870
>> There's at least one more syntax pattern to define the properties of

14
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,100
an object right?

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,780
>> Yeah, bracket notation.

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,090
There's actually one more, but to learn more about that one,

17
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,240
you can check out the instructor's notes.

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,270
Bracket notation is similar to dot notation in that we can

19
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,740
declare an object ,and then later in the code define its properties.

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,678
This time, rather than dots, we'll use brackets.

21
00:01:02,678 --> 00:01:07,780
So, we have bio with the string, city, in brackets equals Mountain View, and

22
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,490
bio, with the string email in brackets equals my email address.

23
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,540
>> Right, so the syntax looks like object, then a string of

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,160
the property name inside these square brackets equals some value.

25
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,110
>> Yeah.

26
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,050
So, if we wanted to append our city to the page,

27
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,120
we just write this code right here.

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,590
And when we refresh our page, we see that it still says mountain view
