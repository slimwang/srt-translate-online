1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Gravity exerts a certain force on that object, and this force results in forces of equal magnitude

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
perpendicular to the surface and parallel to the surface.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This happens because this angle equals 45Â°.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If the coefficient of static friction was 1.0, we would be up a threshold of motion.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The magnitude of the force that pushes the object along the surface is the same

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
as the magnitude with which the object is pushed toward the surface.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If the coefficient of static friction is 0.8, the threshold force would have a magnitude of

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
0.8 times this force, which means it's smaller than the actual force.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This object is going to move. It's going to slide down.
