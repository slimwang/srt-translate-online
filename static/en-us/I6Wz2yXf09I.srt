00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So, for our first question about procedures,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The question is, "What does the 'inc' procedure defined below do?"

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And here's the code for defining 'inc.'

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We're going to define the procedure that takes one input;

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we'll call that input "n,"

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and we are going to have our return statement

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
where the expression following the return is "n+1."

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So what does this procedure do?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The choices are: Nothing.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It takes a number as its input, and outputs that number plus one.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It takes a number as input, and outputs the same number.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Or--the final choice--it takes two numbers as inputs,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and outputs the sum of those two numbers.
