00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,256
We are now ready for
the climatic big theorem of this lesson.

2
00:00:03,256 --> 00:00:06,360
The Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,126
It's states that
the following are equivalent,

4
00:00:10,126 --> 00:00:13,002
f is a maximum flow in a flow network G.

5
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:17,094
The residual graph Gf
has no augmenting paths.

6
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:21,663
And there exists an s-t cut (A,B) such
that the value of the flow is equal to

7
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:23,730
the value of the cut.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,273
This is the realization of
the strategy outlined earlier

9
00:00:27,273 --> 00:00:30,518
where we're going to introduce
the notion of a cut,

10
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:33,761
show that it served as an upper
bound on the flow, and

11
00:00:33,761 --> 00:00:38,520
then show that Ford-Fulkerson produced
a flow with the same value as a cut.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,566
So as an immediate corollary,

13
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:45,980
we have then that the Ford-Fulkerson
approach returns a maximum flow.

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,710
Let's see a proof of the theorem.

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,670
We start by showing that if
f is a maximum flow in G,

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,890
then the residual graph
has no augmenting paths.

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,430
Well, suppose not.

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,820
And let f' be an augmenting flow.

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,390
Then, we can augment f by f', and
as we've argued this will be a flow.

20
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,810
And the value of the flow will be
the sum of the values of the individual

21
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,220
flows, which must be strictly
greater than the value of f.

22
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,120
But we assumed it was a maximum,
so that creates a contradiction.

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,920
Next, we show that the fact that the
residual network has no augmenting path

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,500
implies that there is a s-t cut

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,520
who's capacity is the same
as the value of the flow.

26
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,430
This is the real heart of the theorem.

27
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:38,170
We let A be the set of
vertices we can reach from S.

28
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:43,100
In the residual graph Gf and
we let B be the complement to that.
