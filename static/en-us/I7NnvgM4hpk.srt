00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,710
So, let's get back to computer graphics and see what a graphics processor can

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,914
really do. Well, guess what, computers are fast, a graphics processor consists

3
00:00:07,914 --> 00:00:11,830
of specialized computers working in parallel. Let's get some idea of how much

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,104
processing is involved in rendering a full stream. My monitor is 1,920 by 1,200

5
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:20,104
pixels in size. I'd like to have a frame rate of 60 frames per second. How many

6
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:23,023
pixels must be computed each second to attain this rate?
