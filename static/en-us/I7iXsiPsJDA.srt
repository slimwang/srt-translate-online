1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:07,410
So when you do this you could then come up with a UML diagram that organizes

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,880
the important nouns related to the electronics into a, into a diagram.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,460
In this case there's main classes having to do with the coffee maker which

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,810
as you indicated, then has parts corresponding to the graphical user interface.

5
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:31,090
That would be the buttons and the, the lights to the the part

6
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,770
having to do with the, the boiler which includes a sensor and

7
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,580
a heater and the warming plate which also includes a sensor and

8
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,190
a heater. And then you might get excited by the fact you have two heaters and

9
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,610
have an abstract class for heater and the same thing for

10
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,410
sensor and come up with a diagram that looks something like this.
