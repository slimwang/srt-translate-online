00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:00,810
Now it's time for

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,090
you to use an orthographic camera to
zoom in on the portion of a game world.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,920
We've got a circle moving around in
a figure eight and we'll create and

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,530
apply an orthographic camera that
perfectly contains the vertical range of

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,090
motion while maintaining
the aspect ratio of the world.

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,900
Check out the to dos in the course
code to get started and

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,590
remember the solution code is
always there if you need it.
