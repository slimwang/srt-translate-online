1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,120
The Bricks a Bunch Store, and

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,290
the Lots O Brick Store have been
bought by the same company.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,090
Since management doesn't want to keep
track of two separate inventories,

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,570
we need to combine them.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,400
Your mission, should you choose to
accept it, is to create a Brick

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,300
warehouse service and
extract each store's inventory to it.

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,000
Make sure to inject this service
back into each controller, so

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,730
that the stores still have
access to their information.

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,850
Then create an add to cart button for
the Bricks a Bunch items.

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,450
Clicking the add to cart button should
decrease the stock for the item by one.

11
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,640
Since you're changing the stock for

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,740
this item in the warehouse, the total
count should change here and here.

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,840
A link to this project is
in the instructor notes.

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,080
When you've completed these steps, the
feedback extension will give you a code.

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,180
Enter that code on the next page.
