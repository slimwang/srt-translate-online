00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,500
Okay, Michael, so here's a quiz. Now it's a

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,270
pretty straightforward quiz. I just want you to use everything

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,350
that you've learned so far. Okay, so you have

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,420
three hypotheses. Let's call them h1, h2, and h3, okay?

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:11,480
>> Mm-hm.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,980
>> For the sake of argument. Here's what each of these hypotheses Outputs

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,340
for some particular x. h1 says plus. h2 says minus. h3 says minus. Okay?

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,193
>> Mm-hm.

9
00:00:24,193 --> 00:00:24,990
>> Now here we've,

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,650
already made it easy for you and we've

11
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,880
computed the probability of, a particular hypothesis given some

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,660
set of data. I'm not showing you the data

13
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,870
but I'm showing you the answer for it. Okay?

14
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,436
So the probability of h1 given the data is 0.4, h2 is 0.3, and h3 is 0.3.

15
00:00:39,436 --> 00:00:41,550
Got it? Wait hang on, so, okay, I see

16
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,160
that corresponds here about this given data, what's x?

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,290
>> x is some input, it doesn't matter,

18
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,520
just like it doesn't matter what the date is.

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,830
>> [LAUGH] 'Kay.

20
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,300
>> Just

21
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,880
call it so that, that, x is x, okay? It's just some

22
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,740
object out in the world and each hypothesis labels it. Plus or minus.

23
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,020
>> 'Kay.

24
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,570
>> Or can label it plus or minus. And H1 decides if for

25
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,570
that X, it's positive, and the other two hypotheses decide that it is,

26
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,380
in fact, negative and H1 has probability that is the maximum a posterior

27
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,520
probability h1 is .4, h2 is .3 and h3 is .3. So my question

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,010
is, very simple. Using all of the magic we've done, this is just to make sure

29
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,440
you've got it, Michael, I dunno, we've done

30
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,230
a lot of derivations, we've walked away from some

31
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,800
things [LAUGH] we gotta make sure we get back to basics here. What is the best

32
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,300
label for x? Is it plus, or is it minus? I see why this is tricky. Okay.

33
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,560
>> And go.
