1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,130
How do we control access to resources
with a context of authentication that

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,910
establishes a source and the idea
that these authorization check or

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,670
access control check has to happen if
the resources have to be protected.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,970
Really, for us to be able to
answer this question we had,

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,710
whether a request should be granted or
denied,

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:26,450
we have to know who is allowed to access
what resources in a given system.

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,670
So if you think about this, there
are really two parts to this problem, or

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,870
the way we're going to
address this problem.

9
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:38,440
In part one, someone has to
specify who has access to what.

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,600
So this is called
an access control policy.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,980
So there may be many ways to
decide who gets to access what.

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,830
There has to be a policy
we have in place

13
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,860
that is going to define this for us.

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,430
So to answer this question about who can
access what, is you tell the system how

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:00,340
the resources should be shared, or who
should be given access to what resource.

16
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,084
Once you do that, then it's
the part two is about enforcement.

17
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:09,505
The system has to monitor each
request for these resources, and

18
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:14,482
based on the policy that tells us who
can access what, it should make sure

19
00:01:14,482 --> 00:01:19,842
any accesses that are allowed are
consistent with the policy that we have.

20
00:01:19,842 --> 00:01:23,602
So enforcement basically says
there is no way for you to go and

21
00:01:23,602 --> 00:01:27,472
access a resource when that access
is not allowed by the policy.

22
00:01:27,472 --> 00:01:31,212
So define the policy that's in part one,
and then enforce the policy,

23
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:32,810
that's part two.

24
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,060
Now you can see the importance
of complete mediation.

25
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,680
Clearly complete mediation says,
no one should be able to bypass and

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,350
get to the resource without going
through the trusted computing base.

27
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,660
If you don't have complete mediation
then we can't perform this check,

28
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,130
access control check that
we are talking about.

29
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,450
That is possible only when the trusted
computing base is involved in a request

30
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,730
and that is why complete mediation is so
important.
