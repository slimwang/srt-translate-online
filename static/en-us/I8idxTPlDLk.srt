00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,790
Earlier, we mentioned the key role that
the CCD plays at transitions of care.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,980
In an earlier lesson,

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,920
we saw this screenshot from an actual
commercial health IT system.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,935
Now you know that it does
medication reconciliation

5
00:00:15,935 --> 00:00:20,735
by comparing the medication
section of a CCD from another EHR,

6
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:24,825
here on the left, with the medications
recorded in the patient's record in

7
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:28,155
their physician's EHR,
here on the right.

8
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:31,470
This is a very good example
of the power of standards

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,130
incorporated into electronic clinical
documents, as a tool to improve care.
