00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,931
We can use reduction to combine these 8 local histograms into a single global histogram.

2
00:00:05,954 --> 00:00:11,346
So how do we do this? We simply reduce the first bin of each of the 8 local histograms.

3
00:00:11,346 --> 00:00:14,515
That's an 8-item reduction, and we can do that with a reduction trait.

4
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:17,683
Then we reduce the second bin. And then the third bin.

5
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:21,245
Recall that reduction requires a binary associative operator.

6
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:23,345
Note that adding 2 histograms together,

7
00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:27,714
2 entire histograms of 3 bins each, is both binary and associative.

8
00:00:27,714 --> 00:00:30,546
So it might be more efficient to figure out how to add 2 histograms

9
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:32,630
together during the reduction implementation,

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,543
rather than adding each bin separately.
