00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,230
For the Y axis, remember we oriented it on the left, and

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,460
then also translate it margin, in the X direction.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,920
In this case just a few pixels, and then zero in the Y.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,390
In this case, touching the top of our chart.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:22,360
So in indigo here we have the Y-axis and the X-axis which is margin over and

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,180
height down from our coordinate space which starts at 0,0.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,800
Remember, however, when we created our Y-axis count scale.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,180
The range was height to margin.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,960
So even though we don't translate our y

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,550
axis as Fiji object any it only extends to margin from the top.

11
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:46,520
And before when I drew the x axis it's translated zero in the x direction.

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,950
But again if you scroll back to the timescale,

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,330
you'll remember that the timescale range went from margin to width.

14
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,910
So again this starts not at zero, but margin pixels over.

15
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:06,040
The call function that actually gets past the time axis and the count

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,490
axis is a way to pass the access object through the function call chain.

17
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,470
However understanding this JavaScript function and

18
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,840
its nuances is beyond the scope of these videos, but

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,490
I've left some resources in the instructor notes if you'd like to dig deeper.
