1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This is a particle filter question.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Suppose we had a world with 4 states.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In these 2 states over here, we tend to observe A property 80%.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The remaining 20%, we'll observe B.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In these 2 states, we tend to observe B with 80% probability

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and with 20% probability, we observe A.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Suppose we have 3 particles--1 over here, 1 over here, and 1 over here,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and we observe A.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's call this particle over here particle A. Lower caps a.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Lower caps b.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Lower caps c.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What is the probability that the sample a, given that we just observed A,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
which means it will be more likely to be in 1 of these 2 states over here.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What's the probability of sampling b? What's the probability of sampling c?
