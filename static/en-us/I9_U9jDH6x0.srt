1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:03,933
>> So, oh, it actually sounds like Susan is ready with the next event. And that's

2
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:06,270
Depth Perception. Susan, over to you.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,730
>> Well, some of our sensees are off preparing for the next event. Shortly,

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,430
they're going to be asked a series of questions to determine their depth

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,665
perception.

6
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:17,203
>> And Susan, can you explain to our viewers at home what you mean by depth

7
00:00:17,203 --> 00:00:19,292
perception? >> Right.

8
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:23,805
>> Depth perception is our ability to perceive how far away something is from us.

9
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:26,695
>> And it's all because we have two eyes, right.

10
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:32,515
>> Sure, some of our depth perception cues are binocular, meaning two eye cues.

11
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:35,587
The idea here is that each of our eyes takes in the slightly different version

12
00:00:35,587 --> 00:00:40,277
of the world, and our brain puts that information together. However, not all of

13
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:43,020
our depth perception cues are binocular.

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,985
>> Sorry, Susan. It looks like the competition is about to start.

15
00:00:44,985 --> 00:00:48,832
>> And we're going to let our viewers at home participate in this event, too. So,

16
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:50,800
we'll get back to you with the results in just a minute.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,080
>> That's right, Lauren. So, we're going to show our viewers at home the same

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,137
questions that are being shown to our contestants. So, sit back, enjoy, and see

19
00:00:59,137 --> 00:01:01,467
how you do on the depth perception event in

20
00:01:01,467 --> 00:01:02,693
[UNKNOWN].
