Let's answer this quiz by filling in our Venn diagram. I'm going to put the

2
00:00:04,377 --> 00:00:08,715
letters of M in this circle and we'll put the letters of Y in this circle. I

3
00:00:08,727 --> 00:00:13,325
should 1st look at M and Y to see which letters overlap between the sets. I know

4
00:00:13,337 --> 00:00:17,683
the letters a and t are in both of the sets, so I'm going to list those in, In

5
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:22,129
the middle. We can remember that the letters in the middle are the inner

6
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:27,133
section. It's what shared, or what's between m and y. So for the intersection of

7
00:00:27,145 --> 00:00:31,610
m and y, we have the set a and t. The other letters are just listed in their

8
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:36,451
respective sets, And then for the union, we want to list everything once. So we

9
00:00:36,463 --> 00:00:40,232
have this set, the letters of m or the letters of y, the union.
