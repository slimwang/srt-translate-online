00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:05,740
So personal motivation for
an app has really kind of

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,820
guided my learning,
as far as iOS development goes.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,160
One of the first apps that I really
wanted to build was an app for

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,250
reading comics.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,780
When I started reading
comics on my iPad,

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,800
there weren't a ton of apps
that were really good.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,050
So, I started looking into
what the problem entailed and

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,580
it included things like opening up
zip files and reading byte data.

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:38,430
And without that motivation for
developing this tool for

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,310
myself, even though it may not
be useful for anybody else.

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,560
I never would have gathered that
knowledge and learned all the different

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,360
things about the lower level development
that I otherwise wouldn't have
