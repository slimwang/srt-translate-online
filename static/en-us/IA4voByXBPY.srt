00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,566
Now, let's try and make this more difficult. Here's another logarithmic

2
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:08,660
equation. And notice that there's multiple logarithms on the left and multiple

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,552
logarithms with base six on the right. Now, I know this may look complicated,

4
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:17,136
but we can use our properties of logarithms to rewrite the left-hand side and

5
00:00:17,136 --> 00:00:23,980
the right hand side. So, what expressions do you think go here, and here? So

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,180
that way we can simplify the left hand side, and we can simplify the right hand

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,739
side. Remember that the name of this thing is just called the argument of the

8
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:36,464
logarithm. It's the number that we take the logarithm off. So what are these

9
00:00:36,464 --> 00:00:37,300
two arguments?
