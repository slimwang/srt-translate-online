00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,318
To transform negative y equals the root of x, so that y is by itself on the

2
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:08,440
left hand side, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by negative one.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,758
Then we end up with this, y equals negative square root x. So, just like we saw

4
00:00:13,758 --> 00:00:17,586
before with polynomials, negating the entire function, or in other words, the

5
00:00:17,586 --> 00:00:22,940
entire expression involving x flips the graph upside down. Or in other words,

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,719
reflects it in the x axis.
