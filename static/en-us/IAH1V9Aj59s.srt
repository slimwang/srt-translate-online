There are many different styles of review. Here’s a brief list of some notable

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,570
ones. The class resources page points you to further information about them.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,260
What we’ve been talking about are sometimes called Fagan reviews. Fagan was

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,110
an IBM researcher, her, who first studied them and proposed the structuring that

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,980
we’re, we’re talking about. But a a more recent and alternative approach is

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,250
called pair programming, which is part of extreme programming,

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,870
an agile development method and this was studied by Laura, Laurie Williams.

8
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,950
It suggests that review is part is performed synchronously with, with coding or

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,410
developing of an artifact by having a partner looking over the coder's shoulder

10
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,820
pointing out problems at the time that that coder is, is, is doing his or

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,840
her job or that the designer is doing their design. Another alternative is

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,940
what's called pass-around reviews. These are typically conducted by email.

13
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:58,050
This is often applied in open source projects where the people aren't collocated

14
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,630
and the source code management system alerts participants to take a look when

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:09,850
a new change or new file has been checked into the source control system.

16
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:15,510
And in any of these approaches there's a possibility of applying tools.

17
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:20,790
Tools might be differencers to compare versions the source control management

18
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,400
system itself as I've, as I've indicated, and there're also program analyzer

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,670
tools that can provide enforcement and feedback and examples here are Lint. You

20
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,750
may have heard of the Lint program or CodeCheck, which is a plugin into Eclipse.
