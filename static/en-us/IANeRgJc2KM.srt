Casting with instance of checks is something you will occasionally need to use

2
00:00:03,412 --> 00:00:07,852
when programming in Java, but it's best to avoid it in general. Let's explore

3
00:00:07,852 --> 00:00:11,908
why. Here's the code for seeing.Java that you wrote before. What if we had

4
00:00:11,908 --> 00:00:16,056
accidentally forgotten to do this check and I just gone through all of the

5
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:21,215
elements and tried to move them. What will happen if I run the program now?

6
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:26,106
Feel free to try this yourself in BlueJ. Will the program run the same way?

7
00:00:26,106 --> 00:00:31,290
Will the houses move even though they should be stationary? Will there be a

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,882
compile time error because drawables can't be cast to type movable? Or will

9
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:40,090
there be a run time error? Because some drawables cannot be cast to type

10
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,339
moveable. Like I said, if you're not sure feel free to try it out.
