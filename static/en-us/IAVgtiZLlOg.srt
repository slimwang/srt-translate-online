00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,390
Good job. So the mean should be the same as the population mean. And the

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:09,910
standard error should be the population standard deviation divided by the square

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:15,858
root of the sample size. Which is about 1.56. So remember, since these are the

4
00:00:15,858 --> 00:00:20,742
theoretical mean and standard error based on all possible samples of size five

5
00:00:20,742 --> 00:00:25,774
from this population, they probably won't get exactly the same standard error as

6
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:30,644
what we found. But they should come pretty close. >> So let's see what they got.

7
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:35,572
The standard error of the mean computed using this formula, derived from the

8
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:40,654
central limit theorem is sigma 3.49 and divided by the square root of our sample

9
00:00:40,654 --> 00:00:48,700
size 5. So that's 3.49 Divided by the square root of 5 or n, that comes out to

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,128
be roughly 1.56. If we took the true standard error of the mean, in other words,

11
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:58,684
computed the actual standard deviation for all of the sample means we just took,

12
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:04,750
that value is 1.57. Very, very close to that given by the formula. In checking

13
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,636
the distribution of sample means The sampling distribution of the mean here was

14
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:12,815
approximately normal; not perfectly normal, but pretty close. So all in all, we

15
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:17,435
see the central limit theorem works. It provides us a useful tool that we'll use

16
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:21,865
for the rest of the semester. So, hurray for the central limit theorem!
