00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,340
Let's look at the answer to our, when can we free the reservation stations quiz.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,850
If the instruction cannot issue because there is no available reservation

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,686
station for it, that means that all of our reservation stations are busy.

4
00:00:12,686 --> 00:00:15,510
With a processor that doesn't have a ROB,

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,570
we hold on to our reservation stations. From the time when we issue

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,790
the instruction until the time the instruction brought us a result. So issuing

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,950
of an instruction once the reservation stations are busy will have to wait for

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,340
the next instruction to broadcast the result. In contract,

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,150
in a ROB based processor with the same number of reservation stations,

10
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,030
we grab them at the same time, when we issue the instruction.

11
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,170
But, we free them as soon as we dispatch the instruction for

12
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,100
execution. So we free the reservation stations sooner, thus,

13
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:58,220
the next instruction might find the reservation station free over here.

14
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:04,290
Where over here it was still not available. So this situation is more likely

15
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,623
to happen when we do not have the ROB than when we do.
