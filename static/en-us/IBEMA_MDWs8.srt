1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,310
Let's set up our bullet class by
giving our bullet a speed, direction,

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,700
and position.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,550
Then we need to add a bullet
collection to our level.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,740
Finally, let's test it by spawning
bullets absolutely everywhere.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,080
Create your own bullet storm by creating
the bullet class, adding a bullet

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,800
collection to the level, and then
spawning bullets all over the place.
