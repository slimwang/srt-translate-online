1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,480
Real quick the state model l of t for
location.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,040
So, you can use just x and
y if you think it's just translating.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,700
You can use the similarity transform
which is x y rotation feta and a scale,

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,620
that would be four parameters.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,610
Or you might do a affine defamation if
you're going to allow things to skew

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,630
a little bit.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,370
It doesn't really matter.

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:20,870
You just have to have some model and

9
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,600
some way of saying I'm going to be
able to represent these elements.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,050
What's my dynamics model?

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,980
Well my dynamics, dynamics model that
they use was actually very simple.

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,200
They said, and this is just written P
of L1, given L0, you could write it as

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,590
T plus 1 given T, but then I gotta
write all these T plus 1s, all right?

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,870
And what you see here is
a bunch of independent

15
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,840
normal distributed variables, right?

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,370
So, what this says is that the x value
is just normally distributed about

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,560
the old x value, with some standard,
with some variance, sigma squared x.

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,560
Same thing with the y.

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,520
Same thing with the theta.

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,790
Same thing with the scale.

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,720
So this is a similarity transform.

22
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,450
What is says,

23
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,890
is nothing about how I move an X tells
me anything about how I moved a Y.

24
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,959
That's pure Brownian motion.

25
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,910
So that can be illustrated like this,
right?

26
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,850
So here's Lt, this is where I think
the thing was at anytime t and

27
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,920
what this Brownian motion says well Lt
plus 1, maybe I'm right near by, maybe

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,930
I'm at the same place but, oriented
differently, maybe I'm over here,

29
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,750
maybe I'm over there, maybe I'm
over there, maybe I'm over here.

30
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,780
With a likelihood of being
in any of those locations

31
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,840
depends upon how far I've moved.

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,480
That's what these things here say.

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,150
Okay.

34
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:37,420
So in other words, moving further away
from my old Y gets less and less likely.

35
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,180
What you can do is you can imagine
distributing a whole bunch of

36
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,100
possibilities, and that's what's
illustrated here is Lt plus 1.

37
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,223
And, the idea is that the farther Lt
plus 1 is from L, from Lt, in terms of

38
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:53,530
x, y, theta and scale or any of the
other variables, the less likely it is.

39
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,340
So that's our dynamics model.
