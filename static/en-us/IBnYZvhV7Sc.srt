00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,480
Would this code run?

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,970
No, because the function g
cannot access the variable z

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,780
because it was defined
before the function.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:17,350
Or no, because g is a function and
only closures can capture variables.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,190
Or yes, function g can access
variable z by capturing it.
