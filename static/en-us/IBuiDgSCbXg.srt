1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is no. I mean, of course you can do it, but it'll give you really bad data.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The reason is the data is paired.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
These two guesses correspond to each other.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The same person guessed 78 over here and 80 over here.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The same is true with the next two guesses.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If we just remove the lowest quartiles in the first list and the second list,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
we'll remove different elements, and the surviving elements don't fit together,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we can't really run regression anymore.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We have to keep that correspondence alive.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I removed all the data points where either of the two components

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
would guess a value under 50.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If it said 0 or 1 over here, I'd remove the entire data point in both lists.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The same is true for weights over 120.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I figure I really don't look like a 200 kg guy or like a 1,000 kg person.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I figured 120 is fine, but beyond 120 is really not a reasonable guess.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The reason why I use these brackets is I really have to remove data pairs together.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That was the easiest way for me to remove outliers.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's look at the data again.
