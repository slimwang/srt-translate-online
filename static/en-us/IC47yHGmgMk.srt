1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,770
So here's your last quiz.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,080
And that is how to interpret the coefficients.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,080
So suppose I call this print regression coefficients command.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,200
That's going to return a list of the coefficients on the different features.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,640
And let's suppose the list that it returns has two elements in it.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,158
One has a value of 0.7.

7
00:00:17,158 --> 00:00:19,620
The other has a value of 0.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,000
In this situation how many features would you say.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,070
Are really mattering in the regression.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,600
How many features are really important?
