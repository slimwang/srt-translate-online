00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:01,710
Hi, my name is Sebastian Thrun.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,120
>> My name is Katie Malone.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,770
>> And this is the machine learning class here at Udacity for

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,050
everybody to learn machine learning.

5
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,320
I am a research professor at Stanford.

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,660
I am the founder of Udacity and

7
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,290
I also did things like Google Self Learning Car, The DARPA Self Driving Car,

8
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:20,300
Challenge Ways, Google Street View, Google Glass, Google X.

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,760
And the secret behind my work is, it all reduces to machine learning.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,000
Machine learning is the core of what I do and machine learning enables me

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,390
to build amazing products and amazing user experiences.

12
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,720
>> I'm a physicist by training so I have a little bit of a different background.

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,721
But in physics we use machine learning all the time too.

14
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:37,852
And so what we do, is we start with gigantic data sets of lots of

15
00:00:37,852 --> 00:00:40,400
particles that we create in our detector.

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,313
And we use machine learning to comb through those huge data sets and

17
00:00:43,313 --> 00:00:44,571
to find the one event.

18
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:47,019
Or the ten events out of the millions and

19
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:49,480
billions that help us win Nobel prizes.

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,120
>> And doing good machine learning is just like making great wine.

21
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,800
So I have a bottle of wine here from Italy.

22
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,800
the, analogy goes as follows.

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,170
If you want to, going to make a really great wine you have to make great grapes.

24
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,220
And if your grapes are no good, your wine is no good.

25
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,500
Same is true for machine learning.

26
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,000
You need good data.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,540
You need to really understand your data really well.

28
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,980
And then there's a technique to it to make really great wine and

29
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,590
it's really hard to learn.

30
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,220
Same is true for machine learning there's a technique to look at data,

31
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,560
to understand data, to be able to apply algorithms.

32
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,500
And if you don't master the technique you

33
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,090
will never be a great machine learning person.

34
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,940
>> So in this class, in our machine learning class we're going to start

35
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,940
with a bunch of machine learning algorithms.

36
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,530
But we're also going to be looking at some really interesting datasets.

37
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,120
And we're going to be asking some really interesting and kind of hard questions.

38
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,690
But questions that we think are going to be really cool to answer.

39
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,340
So we're going to start from raw data, and then we're going to

40
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,398
show a machine learning process that sort of goes from beginning to end.

41
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,240
So that you can start with a dataset of your own.

42
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,080
And you know how to tackle it using machine learning.

43
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,740
We are here in Silicon Valley.

44
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,590
And in Silicon Valley machine learning is a big deal.

45
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,120
Companies like Netflix, Amazon, Google and

46
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,760
many others use data on a daily basis to optimize the product experience.

47
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,230
And I can tell you, if you're proficient in big data and understand data

48
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,480
science really well, you will find a job in Silicon Valley, very likely.

49
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,930
And the starting salaries are unbelievably high.

50
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,369
They are often north of $150,000 to an $200,000.

51
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:10,054
>> And even if you're not looking for a job in data science right now.

52
00:02:10,054 --> 00:02:13,022
There's still probably lots of ways that machine learning is something

53
00:02:13,022 --> 00:02:14,050
that you use everyday.

54
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,710
So when I go on Netflix at night.

55
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,650
How do I figure what, what movie I'm going to watch,

56
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,250
Netflix makes recommendation using machine learning.

57
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,900
When I use my credit card, to make a purchase.

58
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,680
There's fraud protection on it, that's machine learning as well.

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,830
You're get some insights into how all kinds of tools that you use

60
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,740
everyday are working, and they're built on top of machine learning.

61
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,930
>> This is a really great class.

62
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,540
>> It's learning by doing.

63
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,770
We'll see you in class.

64
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,790
>> We'll see you in class
