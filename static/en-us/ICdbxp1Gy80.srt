00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:07,800
It's always very illuminating to go back in time and look at the thought pieces

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,350
from computer visionaries, and particular I want to draw your attention to this

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:19,360
memorandum that was done back in 1963 that talks about intergalactic computer

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,290
networks. I encourage you to do a web search and get this document and read it.

5
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:31,600
Here is another one this document talks about the first time

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,390
computers talk to one another. The first computer to computer communication back

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,990
in October 29th, 1969. Now this is considered the

8
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:46,020
first ever email that was written by Ray Tomlinson

9
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,450
from BBN Technologies back in 1971, and with all the junk mail that

10
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,290
is floating around, you might be wondering why

11
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,800
email was invented in the first place, but

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,320
it is a useful tool when it is not junk. This is a log book that was

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,240
maintained by professor Leonard Kleinrock of UCLA who is considered

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,590
one of the networking pioneers. And, this log book records

15
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,580
the first time there was a computer to computer communication. A call was made

16
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:23,330
from UCLA to Stanford Research Institute. Host to host communication recorded

17
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:29,420
on October 29th, 1969. And this is the first ever computer to computer

18
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,910
communication. Here is another interesting chart. This chart shows all the

19
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:41,760
computers in the world in one chart. March of 1977. This is your

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,160
entire internet on one chart back in 1977. And

21
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:54,070
the model of a computer system back in 1975 was, you had a mainframe

22
00:01:54,070 --> 00:02:00,940
computer, which consisted of a CPU, memory, and I/O devices like a disk, and

23
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:07,810
you have cathode ray terminals through which users can connect to the CPU

24
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,840
and use the CPU in a time-shared manner. So this was the model of the computer.

25
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,730
Back in 1975. Note that I'm not showing any connection to any network here. The

26
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,970
reason I'm giving you this buildup with all the first in computer technology and

27
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,850
the model of the computer system, is because the seminal paper by Jerome Swalser

28
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,840
identifies terminologies, you and I know, as

29
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,400
current day issues. Examples include denial of service,

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,760
firewalls, sandboxing, objects, and so on.
