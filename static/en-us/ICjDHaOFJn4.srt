1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,110
Now some more advanced examples.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,790
This is a bit of work we also did.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,730
Here, basically,
we videotaped a hamster and then,

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,520
of course,
we made the hamster walk a line.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,020
So we basically gave it
a trajectory to follow.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,840
In essence, what we did was we
actually did this analysis,

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,620
not over the whole frame but
just the region where the hamster is.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,750
So basically extracted what we
refer to as a video sprite.

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,580
We took a background picture and

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,460
made the video sprite find
the best possible path.

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,560
So no longer are we actually just trying
to figure out the whole video volume and

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,330
finding the best possible frames and
transitions.

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:39,290
We can do this for a small region,
the pixels that just where the hamster

14
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,100
is and, of course, using that we can
make it now, figure out a best possible

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,630
transition set from the data that it
has to be able to walk this path.

16
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,060
Here's basically how we do it.

17
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,840
We actually analyze the the hamster
in a green screen like this, so

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,770
we can remove the hamster out of
the background whenever they're visible.

19
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,950
So here, of course, when it's
the green screen is what we want and

20
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,760
we can separate that layer out.

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,240
The kind of stuff you know
you can do in Photoshop.

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,000
We did this for video and, of course,

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,130
we get all the rich motions including
the shadows and stuff like that.

24
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,550
There's a little bit of machine learning
involved in this work to kind of

25
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,370
differentiate from the front and
the back of the hamster and that

26
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,490
allows us to model all of the phenomenon
of different types of things and

27
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,900
then, that's used to generate
this segment that you just saw.

28
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,070
So here's a final result by just
basically compositing all of them but

29
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,540
also doing the resyncing to
locate the hamster back, and

30
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,920
I think it looks kind of interesting.

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,040
If you look at my website, you'll
find many examples of both this and

32
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,740
some additional work
we've done in this space.
