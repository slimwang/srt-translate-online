00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome to Unit 7. This is the conclusion of the class.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I hope everyone's enjoyed it and learned a lot about cryptography.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'll summarize the class briefly, and then I will talk about one new protocol

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and one new application of cryptography to do secure computation.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
One important point that I want to make today that I haven't made throughout the class enough

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
is that cryptography is very different from security.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
When we're thinking about cryptography, these are very abstract things.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We're thinking about whether we can use math to solve problems.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
On the other hand, security depends on a lot more than just cryptography.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Security is really mostly about people.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
No matter how good your math is,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
if someone picks "123456" for their password, it doesn't matter.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You're not going to have security.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Security is also about the systems and how they interface with each other.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Many of the security problems are because of misunderstanding the connections between systems.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
In this class, we've largely focused on cryptography

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and not addressed the broader issues about security.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But if you want to build secure systems, well these issues are very important.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's not just about the math.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Cryptography is all about secrets,

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and we've seen lots and lots of ways to use secrets to solve problems.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We started in Unit 1, looking at the one-time pad,

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
where we could XOR a message with a key.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And we saw that that provides perfect secrecy in a strong theoretical sense

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that an eavesdropper who intercepts this message can learn nothing at all about the message.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But that it requires a perfectly random key that's never re-used that's as long as the message.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So it doesn't work well in practice.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It also has all sorts of other problems like the malleability of the one-time pad.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This led us in Unit 2 to look at some ways to use practical symmetric ciphers

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
to provide nothing close to perfect secrecy, but something useful for many purposes.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We saw that we could amplify the security provided by a small shared key

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to obtain a secure channel for sending long messages.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And we've talked about modes of operation that can do that with different levels of security.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And then we talked about cryptographic hash functions,

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
which provide a way to map a message to a smaller value that provides pre-image resistance

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
so it's hard to find a message that hashes that value as well as collision resistance.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And this is usual for authentication as well as lots of other purposes that we've seen.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The big limitation of symmetric ciphers is they require a shared secret between the two parties.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
In Unit 3, we talked about key distribution focusing on the Diffie-Hellman protocol for key agreement.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And that allows the 2 parties to establish a shared secret starting from an insecure channel.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That led to asymmetric cryptosystems,

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
in particular RSA as an example of a public key cryptosystem.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That provide the additional functionality where the encryption function

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
doesn't reveal the decryption function.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This enables lots of interesting uses of cryptography.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In Unit 5, we saw how to use public key combined with symmetric ciphers to provide authentication.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And we focused in particular on the TLS protocol

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
that's used as the basis for electronic commerce on the web.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
In Unit 6, we looked at protocols for anonymous routing, voting, and digital cash -

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
all of which combined a mix of asymmetric and symmetric cryptosystems.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So I hope you've enjoyed this tour of cryptography.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We've seen lots of different things that can be built from a few simple primitives.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm going to cover one more protocol in this unit, which is looking at secure computation.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And it uses many of the tools that we've seen in all of these previous units.
