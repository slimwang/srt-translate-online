Let's say we have a compound inequality x is less than 3 or x is greater than 7.

2
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:07,836
How do you show this on a number line? Please fill in what parenthesis or

3
00:00:07,836 --> 00:00:11,994
brackets you think belong in either of these two light blue boxes. And then also

4
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:15,854
check off which of these three regions you think should be shaded in. I'll

5
00:00:15,854 --> 00:00:19,949
assume that if you shade in either of these two regions on the ends, you'll want

6
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,226
the shading to extend forever in this direction or in this direction. Depending

7
00:00:24,226 --> 00:00:28,783
on which end you shade. If you shade in the middle however, I'll assume it's

8
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:30,076
only between 3 and 7.
