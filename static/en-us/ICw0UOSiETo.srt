00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,445
>> What's the sort of design process, I mean I've made my shock absorber

2
00:00:03,445 --> 00:00:06,985
designed it on my three d program and now what do I do, do I hit a button and

3
00:00:06,985 --> 00:00:11,782
send this to a printer or how's that really work? >> So most three d prints work

4
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:17,542
off STL files or OBJ files and almost any 3D software program can export to STL

5
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:22,194
or OBJ. So once you do that, then you can decide what kind of 3D printing is

6
00:00:22,194 --> 00:00:25,773
going to work best for you. Or maybe it's just what's accessible to you.

7
00:00:25,773 --> 00:00:29,962
Something like this was built on an SLA machine, which means it printed similar

8
00:00:29,962 --> 00:00:34,020
to a hot glue gun when printed, right? Where it's a, a hot piece of material

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,616
coming through a hot head and printing out layer by layer and building that up.

10
00:00:38,616 --> 00:00:42,634
Where this one's great. Worst sound in the world but, yeah. >> [laugh] But it's

11
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:46,993
flexible. >> Yeah. >> Pretty awesome. >> And what's really great about it is

12
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:51,089
there's a billion ways to show people on screen your design and your idea, but

13
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:55,249
most people don't really understand that until they can hold it in their hands

14
00:00:55,249 --> 00:00:59,246
and feel it. So, that's really the advent of 3D printing is when I can take this

15
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:02,723
to my boss and say, look this is going to save us so much because of this

16
00:01:02,723 --> 00:01:06,650
design. Look at how much material, you know we've saved or, you know this is

17
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,779
going to work so much better this way that's, that's kind of the glory of it.
