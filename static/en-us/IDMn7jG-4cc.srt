1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,810
The vertex numbering is arbitrary,
so any choice will do.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,840
Here's one.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,900
Given a numbering,
just go through each vertex,

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,660
and, in the corresponding matrix row,
record its outgoing neighbors.

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,180
For instance, I'll start with 0.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,020
Its outgoing edges lead to 1,
3, 5, and 6, so

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,980
you can record these in
Row 0 of the matrix.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,030
Repeating this process should lead you
to the following matrix, or, if you did

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,970
a different vertex numbering, some
permutation of the rows and columns.

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,260
By the way, you might notice that
this matrix has three empty rows.

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,410
These correspond to vertices
with no outgoing edges.

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,030
Similarly, there are two empty columns.

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,540
These correspond to vertices
with no incoming edges.
