00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,480
You might be sitting there thinking
that Colt is over doing it a bit.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,320
After all, he does have
a tendency to come on strong.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,020
And anyway, performance is important
in that way that dental cleanings are.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,260
Everyone knows you should
think about getting them, but

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,270
nobody really wants too.

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,160
But as any grandmother would tell you,
you don't actually have to floss

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,210
all of your teeth just the ones
that you want to keep.

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,780
And similarly, you don't need
to think about performance for

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,680
all of your apps,
just the ones that you want to succeed.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,370
Because Colt brought up a good point.

11
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,280
Users will complain about app
performance three times as often as any

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,530
other issues.

13
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,440
So keep in mind that just because
your app works beautifully in your

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,930
development environment with its perfect
Wi-Fi on your fancy new test phone

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,830
doesn't mean it will always work well.
