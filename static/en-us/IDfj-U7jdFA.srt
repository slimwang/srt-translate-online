00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,620
Okay let us do an exercise together.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,710
This time instead of showing that an object is an instance of a cup,

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:10,050
we are going to try to show that an object is an instance of a Mug. So here is

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,330
the definition of a Mug. A mug is an object that is stable, enables drinking,

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,210
and protects against heat. Notice that we have added one more element here,

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,630
not only stable like a cup, not only enables drinking like a cup, but

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,760
also protects against heat. Here is an object, I will label in the cushion.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,190
The object is light and is made of clay. It has concavity and has a handle.

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,970
The bottom's flat and the sides are thick. You can assume that the agent

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:38,150
knows about all four examples as earlier, the glass, the bowl, the brick, and

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,100
the briefcase. [UNKNOWN] in this particular case the agent also knows about yet

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,730
another example, a Pot. The Pot carries liquid because it is concave,

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,750
It limits heat transfer because it has thick sides and

14
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:56,450
is made of clay. Your task is to. Build an explanation that shows,

15
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,400
that this object is an instance of a Mug. Can we prove this?
