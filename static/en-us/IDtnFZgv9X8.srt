00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,280
You've possibly in the past used remote procedure calls.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,950
This is an example of procedural middleware. The idea here is that,

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,470
your piece of a system needs some computation that's available on another piece,

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,230
and you'd like to make it look,

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,170
in your code, as if you're just making some kind of function call. When really,

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,420
the function that's doing the comp, computing is on another machine.

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,580
Remote procedure calling, technology hasn't been available since the 1980s.

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,050
It is typically synchronous, okay, that is you block until you get

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,362
the procedure call comes back. However, it's operating system dependent. And

10
00:00:39,362 --> 00:00:44,484
there have been technologies developed by SUN and, NDR, for dealing

11
00:00:44,484 --> 00:00:50,080
with the data representations and, and the coordination of the call and return.
