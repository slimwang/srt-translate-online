1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,710
All right,
I reformatted things a little bit.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,983
Mostly I wanted these to
be the two boxes, and

3
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:08,950
wanted you to put the letter of the
highest expected payoff arm in this box,

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,300
and the arm for which your estimate for

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,250
the expected payoff is most
confident in the second box.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:16,950
>> Okay, I can do that.

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,930
I actually think that's
pretty straight forward.

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,530
>> I don't mean anything super
duper technical about this.

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,710
I just want to intuitively what
do we have the most confidence in

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,320
our estimate on?

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,140
Okay, you ready?

12
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,700
>> Okay so one last just to verify,

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,400
I'm suppose to be putting in each
of those two boxes a letter.

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:30,900
>> A letter.
