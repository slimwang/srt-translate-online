00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,280
Okay, so the next thing to do here is to play this movie quote, but

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,290
really slowly.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,665
So here what I want you to do is to read the documentation of

4
00:00:09,665 --> 00:00:11,800
AVAudioPlayer one more time.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,790
By the way, a link to it is in the instructor notes.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,470
See if you can find a function to change the speed of audio playback.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,380
Enter the name of that function here.
