Great job. It really, is just that

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,360
easy. Local storage is widely supported across browsers.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,920
But as we pointed out it does have some down sides. It's a great way to

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,560
get simple storage for persistent data like

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,470
user settings, or users profile strings. But, you

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,240
really don't want to try to use it store

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,920
complex data, like binary files or structured data.
