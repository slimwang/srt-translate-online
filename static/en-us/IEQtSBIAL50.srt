1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So one extremely important operation in analyzing social networks

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
is finding the shortest path between individuals in the graph--

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
not generally because we need the actual path

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but because we want to have some sense of how closely connected

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
different pieces of the graph are.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But the pairwise shortest path problem is of independent interest.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's actually kind of fun and interesting to see

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
essentially what allows Google Maps or MapQuest or Yahoo Maps

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
to plot shortest paths for you to drive.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But another kind of whimsical version of this problem is the Kevin Bacon game.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Kevin Bacon is an actor. He's been in a lot of movies.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And for some strange reason, he's been in lots of different movies

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
with lots of different kinds of people.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And so it turns out to be interesting and not always very difficult

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
to connect Kevin Bacon to any actor you want.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So imagine the problem goes like this.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm going to give you a graph, G, and some node in the graph, v1--call it Kevin Bacon--

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and some other node in the graph--let's say Emma Watson--

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and we're going to try to find the shortest path between them.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In the movie version, the graph consists of the actors connected to each other

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
if they were in a movie together.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Kevin Bacon and Emma Watson have not been in any movies together,

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but there is a short path between them.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We haven't designed an algorithm to do this yet,

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
but, fortunately, there is a source on the Internet--

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
because there's always a source on the Internet--

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
that will help us with this kind of problem.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
There is a website called The Oracle of Bacon. There's Kevin Bacon now.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And what it allows you to do is solve exactly this problem

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
on the graph of movie actors and movies that they've appeared in.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It defaults to Kevin Bacon, but you can actually put in anything you want here.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But we're going to leave it as Kevin Bacon for the moment

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and ask it to find a connection to Emma Watson.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You can see that I tried this in advance.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And we look for a link and, bang, it found one.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It turns out that Emma Watson from the Harry Potter movies

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
was in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and John Hurt was one of the actors in that movie.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Well, it turns out John Hurt was actually in a movie with Kevin Bacon--

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
or is about to be--called Jayne Mansfield's Car.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This isn't possibly the most interesting chain,

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
but one of the things that really is interesting, it's very hard--

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
at least it was very hard for me--to find actors

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
that are more than 2 steps away from Kevin Bacon.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So I tried kind of recent people

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
who you wouldn't think would be in movies with Kevin Bacon,

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and you find out that they're pretty closely connected.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I tried really much older people like Cary Grant.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He is also 2 steps away via Walter Matthau.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So it's just crazy.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
People back from silent movies back in the very beginning of movies being made

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
are 2 steps away from Kevin Bacon through people I haven't heard of.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So there's something special about the position that Kevin Bacon occupies in this graph.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We can find other people. Let's connect Charlie Chaplin and Justin Bieber.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We'll see that that ends up being more than 2 links--at least I expect.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Three? Four? Three.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So Charlie Chaplin--oh!--to, oh, Marjorie Bennett to Fred Willard to Justin Bieber.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
1, 2, 3 links. So it could be that the movie graph is just not really all that wide,

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
at least among the people that are reasonably well known,

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
but that gives you a feel for the way that the problem works.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Now let's talk about how we can actually solve this algorithmically.
