1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,590
You know how to actually
write rules now, so

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,450
why don't you write a read rule for
the users node.

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:09,260
The exact rule is, a user must be
logged in to see a list of users.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,500
Can you go ahead to write
the rule in your json rules now?

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,140
I'll send over the spec.
