1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,250
All right. So let's make sure that we get this concept.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,730
So let's evaluate, tit-for-tat versus tit-for-tat, spy versus spy, and ask

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,620
whether or not they are subgame perfect, or in a subgame

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:16,970
perfect equilibrium with each other. And your choices are yes and no.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:17,820
>> Mm hm.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,290
>> But if you say no, I'd like you to give me a sequence to

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,350
show that it is not subgame perfect. In other words, that if they were to take

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,380
this sequence of actions and this one was to take this sequence of actions,

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,740
it would leave the machines in a position where they would not be willing to

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,480
follow through on their threat. That it would be better for them to do something

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,160
else in the long run, assuming that

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,130
they're still playing against the other tit-for-tat machine.

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,110
>> From that point on.

14
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,550
>> Yup.

15
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,330
>> Just imagine that someone could go in and change one thing.

16
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,680
Would you still want to follow tit-for-tat the next time step or not?

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,390
>> Yeah, I don't know

18
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,360
if that has to be just one thing, but yeah. That's

19
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,520
right. Change, change the sequence leading up to this point and

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,210
then say, okay, do you still want to do what tit-for-tat is

21
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,000
telling you to do, or would you rather do something else?

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,180
>> Right. Okay. I think I got it.

23
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,500
>> Cool. All right. Go.
