00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,403
From here, solving for x is pretty simple. What I would like you to do next is

2
00:00:03,602 --> 00:00:07,777
collect all of the terms with variables, so all of the terms with x, on the left

3
00:00:07,789 --> 00:00:11,914
side of the equation, and all the terms with constants on the right side of the

4
00:00:11,926 --> 00:00:15,786
equation. So, please use paper and pencil to do this. In fact, I'd like you to

5
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:19,554
use paper and pencil to solve all of these equations and write out all the

6
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:22,868
steps. And you can either choose to combine like terms on either side of the

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,138
equation or you don't have to if you don't want to. And last but not least, I

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,004
would like you to fill in your final answer for x in the bottom box.
