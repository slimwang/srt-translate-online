1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,100
So this is actually a pretty tricky question. We've talked

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,350
a lot about vocabulary, but applying your knowledge can be

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,970
a little bit more difficult. But, let's start from the

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,760
bottom and work our way up. So we know that

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,158
negative 100,000 x is a term. That means that negative

6
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:19,770
100,000 itself is not a term on its own. So

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,820
that means that it's not a variable term or a

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,296
constant term, since it's part of a term. You'll learn more

9
00:00:25,296 --> 00:00:28,230
about parts of terms in the next lesson.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,700
We also know that since this is a number

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,014
and its value is not going to vary, negative

12
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:37,130
100,000 is not a variable. And in the same

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,200
way, since its value is fixed, it's a

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,380
constant. It's just a number. And since it's a

15
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,090
number that's multiplied by a variable over here, it's

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,480
a coefficient. So, negative 100,000 in this context is

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,220
a constant and a coefficient. Cool. Great job working

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,230
on all of this vocab in your first lesson.
