1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,735
The answer is both the second and the third are true. We have our restaurant

2
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:08,750
class, which has, its base class is object, and object has many methods

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,286
including both init, and str. Restaurant doesn't define any attributes but it

4
00:00:13,286 --> 00:00:17,212
inherits all of the attributes defined by object. What's happening somewhere

5
00:00:17,212 --> 00:00:21,181
inside print is this object is being converted to a string by calling its str

6
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:26,115
method. The self object for str, is this restaurant object. So the self object

7
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:29,690
is a restaurant which means its a restaurant instance so that's why the second

8
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,315
one is true, its also an object instance. Every object that we create is an

9
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:37,475
intance of its own class as well as all of the super classes or the base classes

10
00:00:37,475 --> 00:00:41,320
of that object. So that's why the third one is true also. So there's nothing

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,675
magical or mysterious going on, other than Python implementing a simple object

12
00:00:45,675 --> 00:00:46,913
system that does this.
