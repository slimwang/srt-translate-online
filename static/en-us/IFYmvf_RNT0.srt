Hi, I'm Sean Bennett,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and I'll be TAing Steve's course on Web Application Engineering,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
where--by the end of the course--

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
you'll have a Web app--up and running--

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
on Google App Engine.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is my first term at Udacity, and I'm really excited to help everyone out.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm going to be helping you get Google App Engine

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
up and running, and I'll also be there to

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
talk with everyone in the forum, in case you have any questions.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Thanks, and I can't wait to see you in class.
