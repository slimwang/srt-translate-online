1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,719
You've started identifying the important
fields in the JSON response

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:07,180
that we'll need to extract in order to
display the correct data in our app.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,990
Now, remember that once we know what
key value pairs we're interested in,

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,420
we also need to figure out how to
traverse the JSON object tree in order

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,600
to write app code that will parse those
same fields automatically for us.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,460
By examining the formatted JSON data,
figure out the traversal path from

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,690
the root to the keys that
are specified in the quiz.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,940
So here's your task.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,270
I'd like you to describe in words,

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,170
the traversal path that you'd have to
take to get the specific pieces of

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,995
information within the JSON
response from the earthquake API.

12
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:38,025
Now here, I'd like you to describe
the path to find the magnitude of

13
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:39,655
the first earthquake.

14
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:43,515
Next, I'd like you to describe the path
you need to take to get to location,

15
00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:46,907
then the same for time, and
the same for the website.

16
00:00:46,907 --> 00:00:51,207
Also, be sure to use a JSON formatter
to make it easier to read the response.

17
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:54,712
You could write your answer in the form
of say, root node, right arrow,

18
00:00:54,712 --> 00:00:57,917
JSONObject with name X right arrow,
and so on.
