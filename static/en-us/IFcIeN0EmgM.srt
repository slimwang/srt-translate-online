1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,290
Earlier in the course you found out
that there aren't enough addresses to go

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,540
around.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,430
There are actually fewer IPv4 addresses
than there are people in the world, and

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,530
some of us use way
more than one address.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,030
I mean, every sensible person
carries five computers with

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,000
them at all times, right?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,470
The major workaround has been for

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,780
ISPs to assign only one address to each
household, office, or other customer.

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,090
And if you had a one computer household,
it would obvious how this would work.

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,300
One host, one IP address.

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,180
But as people have lots of different
computers and devices in their house

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,990
today, they all have to hide behind
this one IP address and from

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,440
the outside world have to look just like
a single machine with a single address.

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,040
Well, how does this work?

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,010
Let's take the example
of a home network.

16
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,620
Maybe they've got a desktop computer,
and a laptop, and a smart TV, and

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,940
some phones, and all of these talk
to the internet through a router,

18
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,940
which acts as their default gateway.

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,769
The router connects to their ISP and
gets a single real public IP address,

20
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,610
and then it assigns private
addresses to all of these devices.

21
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,230
Private IP addresses come off of one
of three reserved IP address netblocks.

22
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,055
The most common private IP addresses
found on home routers are in the network

23
00:01:17,055 --> 00:01:20,060
192.168.0.0/24.

24
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,220
With the default gateway of 192.168.0.1,

25
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,470
this is only one of very many
private IP address possibilities.

26
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,960
If you ever need to look these up,

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,870
they're specified in an internet
standard called RFC 1918.

28
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:38,700
Private IP addresses are used
with a system called NAT or

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,070
network address translation.

30
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,480
The way that it works is that whenever
traffic goes between the private network

31
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,200
behind the router and the public
internet, the router has to rewrite or

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,980
translate to the network
addresses on it.

33
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,950
The router maintains a map of
which inside addresses and

34
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,540
ports are connected to what public
internet addresses and ports.

35
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,682
Now most likely your own home or
office network is using NAT, but

36
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:06,490
NAT is really a workaround not
a solution to address shortage.

37
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,930
It creates some pretty serious problems.

38
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,930
It makes it much harder,
sometimes impossible,

39
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,140
for end users to run servers
that other people can access.

40
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,440
That makes it hard to write and

41
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,850
debug network applications that
are going to run on end user machines.

42
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,850
The router has to keep track of all
the connections going through it, and

43
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,320
because your computer doesn't
know it's real public address,

44
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,900
applications on it can't easily say
things like forward all my internet

45
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,710
phone calls to this address without
hacky extra protocol arrangements.

46
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,600
And more moving parts makes
them more error prone.
