1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,180
>> All right, take me through.

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,760
>> Okay. So, the first thing I want to say

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,900
is, I think it's awesome that you made me do

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,990
this quiz. The second thing I want to say is,

5
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,660
in some sense, every single one of them is correct.

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,880
>> Yay!

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,810
>> But, you put radio buttons down, not check

8
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,430
box buttons, thingys, so I have to pick one. So

9
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,260
let's just go through. Figure out the best line

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,370
to wait in. Well, that is a queue, queue which

11
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,110
would make a lot of sense if I were, say, English.

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,640
>> Yes, that's right. In fact, you are, in this picture.

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,590
>> Oh yeah, great. [LAUGH]

14
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,260
That's the English version of Charles, the one with the top hat. Okay.

15
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,280
>> Yeah, and a cane, too.

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,300
>> Yeah, I like it. And a cane, yes, well

17
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,660
that is typically what I do whenever I go to

18
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,520
London. Discovering when to come in for your line, that

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,400
is also a queue-learning though a different kind of queue. que-learning.

20
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,030
The third practicing your best bank shot,

21
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,900
although I probably would've said break shot.

22
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,520
>> Ooh, nice.

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,230
>> That is also cue-learning.

24
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,920
>> And it's the same spelling.

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,410
>> That's the same spelling.

26
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,040
>> That's unfortunate.

27
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,070
>> Well, you pronounce one cue, and you pronounce the other one cue.

28
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,750
>> Yes, well clearly. But, and I spelled them that way too.

29
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,500
>> Yeah, and I know. I know. I can see where the emphasis is. And the

30
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,420
fourth one is evaluating the Bellman equations from

31
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,690
data. That is you take in the states,

32
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,520
the actions, rewards and the next states, and you try to

33
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,350
learn an actual Q function, which is just the letter Q.

34
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,570
So that is Q-learning, and is the only one that is

35
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,070
spelled correctly, and so that is the choice that I would make.

36
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,000
>> Alright, so, just to be clear here. So

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,930
this all [LAUGH] the purpose here other than to.

38
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,043
>> Demonstrate your ability to show puns?

39
00:01:38,043 --> 00:01:40,590
>> [LAUGH] Is that is just to

40
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,695
give the definition. So that, so what Q-learning

41
00:01:42,695 --> 00:01:45,545
is going to be doing is it's going to use transitions, that is

42
00:01:45,545 --> 00:01:48,940
to say data, to directly produce the solution to those Q equations.
