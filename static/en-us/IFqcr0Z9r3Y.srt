1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,530
The overall layout of your page should look fine right now,

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,390
but it doesn't quite look right.

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,070
For starters, we don't actually have images here.

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,870
Of course, you could use the images that are in the design mock up.

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,200
But that doesn't make much sense because those aren't images of

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,110
your actual projects.

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,850
In situations like this, it makes sense to have some type of place holder image.

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,270
Right here, we have place holder images that simply show how large they are.

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,550
Right now, I'm using placehold.it,

10
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,750
which is an awesome website that makes really fast and easy placeholder images.

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,570
Each image simply has its dimensions printed inside it.

12
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,590
To use images from placehold.it, simply follow the pattern here.

13
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,230
It's just an image that starts with placehold.it/ and then the dimensions.

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,110
Inside the source code for

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,030
the website, we can see a lot of links using placehold.it.

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,210
Let's see if it works.

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,310
I'm going to change this image from 960 by 350 to 1,000 by 350,

18
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,640
and I will save it.

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,380
So when I refresh the page, we should see that this turns into 1,000 by 350.

20
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,060
And there we go, the image is a little bit larger.

21
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,410
Of course, these are pretty boring and

22
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,180
it's important to have fun while your working.

23
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,745
So, instead of using placehold.it there are other services.

24
00:01:05,745 --> 00:01:10,940
Placepuppy.it is an even more fun way of including placeholder images.

25
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,610
Look at those cute dogs.

26
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,150
Oh my god.

27
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,207
They're so cute.

28
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:20,510
[LAUGH] Oh, yeah, anyways you can use placepuppy.it/ the dimensions here and

29
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,160
you could also include these in the page.

30
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,070
Let's give one a shot.

31
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:23,940
We'll come back to here.

32
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:29,753
And instead of placehold.it, let's make it placepuppy.it and

33
00:01:29,753 --> 00:01:34,620
1000 by 350 and we'll save it and let's come back to our demo.

34
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,905
And when we hit refresh,

35
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:40,200
[LAUGH] we, we have the top of a dachshund staring at us and it's adorable.

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,830
So, that's another way of making your life a little bit more fun.

37
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,990
But for those of you who aren't dog lovers, there's also kittens.

38
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,520
Adding cats to the website is as easy as using placekitten.com.

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,850
And it follows pretty similar syntax to, placepuppy.it.

40
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,927
Cats make me allergic.

41
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:55,200
So I'm not going to use them.

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,784
But, all right, you know, you know what?

43
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,570
Tell you what, let's try one out.

44
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,263
All right.

45
00:01:59,263 --> 00:02:02,050
So placekitten.com/ the dimensions.

46
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,647
So let's, instead of placepuppy let's make it placekitten.com.

47
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:09,270
So we have placekitten.com instead of placepuppy.it.

48
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,960
And we have the same dimensions.

49
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,500
And when we refresh the page, now we have an adorable cat starring at us.

50
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,760
So, you've got options for

51
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,320
making your life a lot more fun when your building websites.

52
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,730
Which of the following placeholder images do you prefer using?

53
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,240
None.

54
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,110
Because using the real images is probably the best strategy.

55
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,550
Or do you like using placehold.it, because seeing dimensions is really helpful?

56
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,240
Do you like placepuppy.it because seeing dogs just makes your day better?

57
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,660
Or do you think that kittens with placekitten.com is the way to go?

58
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,880
If none of these type your answer in here and

59
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,080
let us know which one you like using.
