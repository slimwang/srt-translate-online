1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,745
So, according to multiple intelligence theory, there's a lot of different forms

2
00:00:02,745 --> 00:00:06,365
of intelligence. But, is there any evidence to actually support this?

3
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:09,677
>> Yes, there is. In fact, some of the strongest evidence to support Gardner's

4
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:14,538
theory of multiple intelligences comes from savants. And savants are people who

5
00:00:14,538 --> 00:00:18,378
have uncanny cognitive ability and at the same time, uncanny cognitive

6
00:00:18,378 --> 00:00:23,955
disability. So for instance, they might be able to remember things, calculate

7
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:28,928
things or have incredible musical talent. And yet at the same time, they really

8
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:34,082
have other cognitive disabilities. So we'll be talking more about this later on

9
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:38,067
in the lesson. But the thing to take away right now is the fact that this

10
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:43,890
mismatch between cognitive ability and disability supports Gardner's theory.

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,372
Other evidence suggests that there is something in between. This intelligence

12
00:00:48,372 --> 00:00:51,480
says one thing or intelligence is as many things.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,443
>> Are you talking about the Catal Horrell theory of intelligence?

14
00:00:54,443 --> 00:00:55,109
>> Yes I am.

15
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:56,864
>> I think I'm going to go explain that now.
