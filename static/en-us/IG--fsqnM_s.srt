00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,228
We now have the triangle's geometry defined. An object in 3D graphics needs both

2
00:00:05,228 --> 00:00:09,512
geometry, and a material. So this the glue code that you need to actually

3
00:00:09,512 --> 00:00:14,536
display the thing on the screen. You add a material, and we'll talk about this

4
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:19,778
next unit. And you put the geometry and the material together into what's called

5
00:00:19,778 --> 00:00:24,266
a mesh in 3JSm, and then you add that mesh to the scene. In the exercise you

6
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:27,980
won't be doing this part. You'll be filling in a function that creates the

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,862
square. The function you'll be implementing is called draw square and takes a

8
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:36,260
lower left hand coordinate and upper right hand coordinate. What you'll return

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,143
from this function is a geometry object which then the program will draw.
