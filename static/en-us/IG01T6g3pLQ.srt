1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,920
One of the most important things we want you to learn

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,290
from this course, is to develop the eye of a designer. So

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,050
you should be walking around the world, looking all the time.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,190
Looking at things around you. Judging. Saying that's a really good example.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,930
Or ooh, that's a bad example. But when you do this,

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,270
it's really good to document it Not only for your own benefit,

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,440
because you want to show them to other people. You might want

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,810
to show them to clients. You might want to give a talk.

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,970
And illustrate the points. So you have to have pictures.

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,119
And the pictures have to be effective. Show exactly the

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,780
point you're trying to make, and tell a story. So

12
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,640
it may take several pictures of the same object, to

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,240
tell the story. So, in this next assignment, we're going to

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,500
cover that. So let's start off though, with what it

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,620
takes to make a good picture. First of all the

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,990
camera. You know, doesn't do any good to have a great

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,090
camera if it isn't with you. So the

18
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,830
most important aspect about a camera is, have it

19
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:00,750
with you. So take a look at this one.

20
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,860
Cellphone camera. It's always with you, that'a a virtue.

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,340
The problem is, it's not really a good camera.

22
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,200
It can't be, it's just too small. So if

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,890
you want to take a picture, and the object is

24
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,270
really small. And you want to enlarge it. Nah,

25
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,940
cellphone camera isn't good enough. But, in an

26
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,420
emergency this is the best camera to use.

27
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:29,380
I use it all the time. The really best camera would be something like this. This

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,580
is a single lens reflex. It takes high

29
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,590
quality pictures, it's a very big detector. High

30
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,250
quality lens. But it's big, it's bulky. So

31
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,060
I myself, don't use it. I would love to.

32
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,680
But I just can't imagine carrying it with me all the time. So I

33
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,936
compromise. I carry a medium-size camera. Carefully

34
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:56,460
chosen, so it's of the highest quality. Yet small enough though, that it will

35
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,920
fit in my pocket. Or, it fits in a bag on my

36
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,850
belt. Has a good lens. Has a fairly large sensor.

37
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,800
So it takes high quality pictures that I can blow up. And all the

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,640
pictures, in the design of everyday thing

39
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,180
that I took, were taken, with this camera.

40
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:22,300
Second point. Take lots of pictures. Don't take one

41
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,070
picture. And don't sit there and just try to take

42
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,990
one or two. Professionals might take hundreds of pictures just

43
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,760
to get one. So take lots of pictures from different

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,700
angles, different zoom lenses. Closer, further away. And with

45
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,650
different lighting. Don't use flash. Flash wipes out all the

46
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,940
details. But make sure turn on all the lights. And

47
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,750
maybe use a piece of white paper as a reflector.

48
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,320
Do whatever you can do, to light it as well as you can. Naturally.
