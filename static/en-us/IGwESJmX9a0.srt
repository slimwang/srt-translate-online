1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,720
This wasn't too hard.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:06,350
The green box and the light blue box,
both have widths of 50%,

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,040
because they take up half
the width of the container, but

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,990
all the other boxes like the dark blue,
the red, and the orange,

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,400
all take up the full width of
the container, so they're at 100% width.
