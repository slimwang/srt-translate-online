1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,090
A great place to start when
researching your distribution plan

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,580
is through Google Trends.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,220
Google Trends is
a completely free service

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,340
that allows you to see
the popularity of search terms

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,140
in relation to the total volume
of search terms across the world.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,650
And in various languages.

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,952
Google processes over 40,000 search
queries every single second, and

8
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:23,270
they're willing to share
those insights with you.

9
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,550
The reason why this is a great place to
start is that not only can you see some

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,970
really interesting things from
all of these search queries,

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,479
like the most searched topic of the day.

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,660
But you can also see the history
of these search terms and

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,240
of related terms for your business.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,910
So I have Ronnie here with me,

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,140
let's use her expertise to dive
into Google Trends a little bit.

16
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,810
>> Let's go to Google Trends and
see what comes up.

17
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,670
Let's go to explore topics and
type in pet sitting.

18
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,100
So we see here that interest over
time is relatively consistent,

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,760
although I see that there are some big-
>> Yeah, that's interesting.

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,640
>> If you look at the dates, yeah,

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,760
you can see that there
is a peak every summer.

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,470
>> Oh yeah.

23
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,740
>> So people are searching more for pet
sitting during their summer vacations.

24
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,140
>> Yeah and maybe not as much
during their holiday vacations,

25
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,220
that's interesting.

26
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,330
>> Yeah let's scroll down.

27
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,170
>> So what are these regional interests?

28
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,370
>> Here we can see where
the search term is most popular.

29
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,350
>> So
like the United States is most popular?

30
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,410
>> Yeah, you can see here
the United States, it has 100.

31
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,960
So this is where
the search is most common.

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,430
The place with the greatest
volume will always have 100, and

33
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:37,510
then all the other numbers here
are always relative to the 100 number.

34
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,550
Okay, so we see that people in
the United States, Canada, Australia and

35
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,820
even the United Kingdom, I guess,
are the most interested in pet setting.

36
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,825
>> Not exactly, we can assume that these
countries are the top ones to search

37
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:50,900
this exact search term in English.

38
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,460
So it's not that surprising that
the top countries are English-speaking

39
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,360
countries.

40
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,250
Let's make sure we
compare apples to apples.

41
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,930
So, either we compare a few different
English-speaking regions or

42
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,500
we decide to compare between
different search terms.

43
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,710
>> So, if we click on United States,
let's see a breakdown.

44
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,770
So pet sitting is the most popular
in New Hampshire, it seems, and

45
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,770
North Carolina, Arizona, Colorado.

46
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,360
>> Yeah, actually, we can choose
these regions as our pilot regions or

47
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,280
something like that.

48
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,310
>> Oh, that's awesome.

49
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,280
>> Let's go back for
a second with the world wide view.

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,858
This can also give us insights
on popular related terms.

51
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:28,190
Let's go down.

52
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,410
This can also give us insights about
related searches and related terms.

53
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,320
So in our messaging and tag line and
wording that we use in our website and

54
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,620
messaging, we can use not
only dog sitting, but

55
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,910
also pet sitters, pet sitter,
pet care, pet sitting services.

56
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,610
And other terms that people
already search more.

57
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,794
>> It's cool how they break it down
I'm sure that'll help you develop what

58
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,373
keywords you're going to want to use.

59
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:53,220
>> Let's go back to the top.

60
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,020
I want to show you
the categories section.

61
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,820
>> Here?

62
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,190
>> Yeah,
this can be very helpful in research.

63
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,177
So we have options like Hobbies
& Leisure, Pets & Animals,

64
00:03:03,177 --> 00:03:04,810
Jobs & Education.

65
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,520
Categories are important if you want to
expand into the Google Display Network.

66
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,430
The Google Display Network allows you to
place display ads on related websites.

67
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,630
And you can choose where to
advertise based on categories.

68
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,850
What we learn here will help us choose
a category of websites to advertise in.

69
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,410
Clearly pets and animals seems relevant
to us, but look, under jobs and

70
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,360
education, the interesting
pet sitting shot up after 28.

71
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,590
>> That's interesting, I would have
never thought to look at this.

72
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,230
So what else can we find in web search?

73
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,500
>> Just a second, before we do that,
let's go back to jobs and

74
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,050
education and go back to all categories.

75
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,970
>> Yeah so this will show us the
interest level based on specific types

76
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,640
of searches.

77
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,820
For example, if we learn that our top
search term is super popular in image

78
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:52,250
search too, we might consider this
as another advertising option.

79
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,460
We can make sure that there are plenty
of relevant images that will link

80
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,990
back to our website.

81
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,724
Another cool thing you can do is
actually to compare different search

82
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:02,580
terms, and it's not necessarily for
image search, it can be for

83
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,270
web search too.

84
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,670
>> Let's go back to web search and-
>> Yeah,

85
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,650
let's just add another term,
like dog services.

86
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:14,350
And it's interesting to see that
maybe a few years ago, the demand was

87
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,610
quite similar, but recently, you can
see that the demand for the red one,

88
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,520
which is dog service,
is much higher than pet sitting.

89
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,090
>> It's interesting.

90
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,925
Yeah, pet sitting seems
to slowly be declining.

91
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:29,470
>> Yeah, so whether you have to decide
how to phrase your tag line or which key

92
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,260
words to choose for your campaign,
either way it helps you focus better.

93
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,190
Sometimes it can really show
you the demand of the market.

94
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,190
I mean if people search more for
Product X or Product Ym so

95
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,540
you can develop the product that
has more demand on Google Search.

96
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,350
Demand can be seasonal,
as you can see here.

97
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,299
So you could use that either to choose
which app to develop or at least to plan

98
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:55,250
your advertising campaigns around
things people search for on holidays or

99
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,220
in the Summer, or
around back to school, for example.

100
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,540
So for us, if we see in that during
summer people are searching more for

101
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,130
pet sitting, we know that this is
a time where we want to really,

102
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,720
really hit our campaigns.

103
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,370
>> It's surprising to see
how seasonal pet sitting is.

104
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,970
So maybe we should target families
more than just business people.

105
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,550
>> Yeah, we learned something.

106
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,480
>> Look at that.

107
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,805
Okay, well let's go to
a question about this.

108
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:18,100
Okay, so we saw this tool.

109
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,460
I think it's pretty awesome, and
I could have a lot of fun with it, but

110
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,060
I think it's time for
you to explore it a little bit more.

111
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,490
I want you to go to Google Trends and

112
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,100
explore a search term
that's related to your app.

113
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,160
If you don't have one, go ahead and

114
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,400
use Embarkment, but
don't use the same search term we did.

115
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,270
Then fill in the blanks below.

116
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,500
First I want you to tell
us what term you used.

117
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,310
Then what city was that
term most popular in?

118
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,780
Then check out the related terms.

119
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,580
What are the two most
popular related terms?

120
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,540
Add one here and here.

121
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,020
And finally, just for fun,

122
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,710
what was the most surprising thing you
found out when exploring Google Trends?
