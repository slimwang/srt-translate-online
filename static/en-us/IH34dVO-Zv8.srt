We haven't covered this yet, but you might be wondering, what about zeros in

2
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:08,249
fractions? How do they happen, and can they happen? Let's look at some squares

3
00:00:08,261 --> 00:00:12,154
to figure this out. Here, I have a square broken up into four equal pieces.

4
00:00:12,249 --> 00:00:14,178
Notice that none of them are shaded. That's okay.

5
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:19,077
I can still have 0 out of 4. For fractions, the numerator tells us the number of

6
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:23,023
equally sized pieces we have. The denominator tells us how many pieces our

7
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:27,747
whole, in this case, our square is split in two. Notice that I have none of them

8
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:32,034
shaded. So, I have 0 out of 4. Since I have no pieces, it's really just 0, 0

9
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:36,444
divided by 4 is 0. For this square, it doesn't make sense to split it up into

10
00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:40,961
zero pieces. I can't take a square and divide it by nothing. It just doesn't

11
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:44,668
make sense. Fractions with zero in the denominator are undefined.
