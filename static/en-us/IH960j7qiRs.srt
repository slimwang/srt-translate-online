00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,670
Hopefully you were able
to type that in okay.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,170
In Java, variable names, data types,

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,350
method names, they are all case
sensitive, so it's important to

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,210
pay attention to whether a letter
should be capitalized or not.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,890
Another potential mistake when you're
creating a new variable is that you

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,430
might forget the data type or
you might forget the semicolon.

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,570
By typing this out, now you've had
experience creating and using variables.

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,730
In the video, we'll explain a little
more about what you actually just typed.
