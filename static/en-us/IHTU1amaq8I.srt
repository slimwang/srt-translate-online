1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's take a look at the answers.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This 33 is definitely going to match, we hope--

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we're going to get to this in a minute--our numbering rule.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And then we're going to end up converting it into an integer.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
33 looks pretty good.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Is will match the word is.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Less will match the word less. Than will match the word than.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
55 could be converted to a number, give us the integer 55.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And all of this white space in the middle will be dropped.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This is a possible answer.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Here we have pretty much the same thing except that

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
we appear to be returning a space as a word.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's not going to happen because our words can't include spaces,

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and this white space rule would skip over it beforehand.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's not it.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Here looks a lot like the beginning,

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
but instead of matching 33 and 55 as numbers,

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
we appear to have matched them as words because

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
we've returned this string unchanged.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This isn't really what we wanted,

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but actually, nothing prevents that from happening.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
33 could match either our word regular expression--

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
33 is not a space, it's not a less than, it's not a greater than--

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
or our number definition, and I haven't told you how to resolve

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
this sort of ambiguity.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, that word is back from the dead.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is also a possible answer.
