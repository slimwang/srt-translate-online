1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,270
Absolutely false.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:07,140
Even though all blocks in a serial
queue run one after the other,

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,640
that doesn't mean that
we've lost concurrency.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,470
Each queue will run on its own thread
and will not block each other.

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,400
The main difference between serial
queues and concurrent queues,

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,520
is that in former, the order in
which closures run is predictable,

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,450
while in the latter, it isn't.

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,530
Synchronous cues are easier to use,
so we'll stick to them.
