1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,620
Now, let's move on to the next
step of the authentication flow.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,910
According to Eden's diagram,

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,540
the next thing we need to
do is log in with the API.

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,990
If we look back at the code as
soon as we get our request token,

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,130
this is where we need to
continue to the next step.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,730
First, let's store the request
token in the app delegate

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,430
in case we need it later, and then
we'll call the loginWithToken method.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,700
If we skip down to this method,

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,680
we can see that it's currently empty,
and I did this on purpose.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,920
I want you to get more exposure writing
the networking code involved in

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,640
all 7 steps, so that the code
just becomes second nature.

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,270
For this exercise,
start in the API's documentation, and

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,280
find the proper method for
logging into the movie database.

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,690
Once you find it, take a look
at any required parameters and

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,040
also what an example response
looks like for that method.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,448
Then, implement the 7
steps in order to login.

17
00:00:53,448 --> 00:00:56,950
And once you're able to successfully
login with the API, print a message that

18
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,930
says you're ready to get the session ID,
and when you're done, check this box.
