[Norvig] And here is 1 answer.

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For straight what I did was I said it's a straight if the difference between the max

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and the minimum is 4--

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
say 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; 6 minus 2 is 4--

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and also if all the cards are different.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So make a set out of the ranks, and if the length of that set is 5,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that means if there's 5 different ranks that have a max versus minimum of 4,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
then it's a straight.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
For flush what I did is I extracted out the suits,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
iterated over the hand with the r and s being the 2 characters within each card,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
collected up all the s into this list,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and then I asked, is the length of that set equal to 1?
