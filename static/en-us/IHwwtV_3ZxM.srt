00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,026
Now, we're almost to an equation that can be factored. We just need to

2
00:00:04,026 --> 00:00:08,658
rearrange the terms, so all of the terms are on one side of the equation. If

3
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:12,316
all the terms are on one side of the equation, that means the other side must

4
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:17,390
equal 0. What I want you to do is to rearrange the equation so that happens.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,951
What do you think we'll get here?
