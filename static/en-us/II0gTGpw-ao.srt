1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,540
And finally I'd like to show you this
illustration from Intel that summarizes

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,440
the advances in the Intel VT
architecture over the last decade or so.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,340
The lowest set of boxes
summarize the impact

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,950
of the virtualization related
hardware modifications that have been

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,370
added along the three
different dimensions.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,080
The three dimensions are as follows,
vector 1,

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,890
refers to any CPU related
modifications and

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,420
this includes things like fixing issues
with non-virtualizable instructions or

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,000
adding support to the CPU for
extended page tables.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,930
Vector 2, refers to modifications
pertaining to the entire chipset,

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,670
such as chipset site support for
technologies like what's called SR-IOV,

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,210
that technologies that help with IO
virtualization, or for IO routing and

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,960
mechanisms for direct device access, or
support rather for direct device access.

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,460
And then the third vector,
the third dimension in which

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:07,210
Intel has contributed to the evolution
of virtualization friendly technology,

16
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,460
is to actually push advances in
the device level technology.

17
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,070
So this is what's happening on the
device as opposed to on the chip you,

18
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,690
on the chipset or the CPU side.

19
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,340
And with this draws
devices are more easily

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,110
integrated in a virtualized environment.

21
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:31,480
This includes things like support
on the device for DMA remapping so

22
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,560
that it can appropriately
DMA into the correct set of

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,760
memory depending on the virtual
machine that it targets.

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,650
And to also support the multiple queue,
the multiple logical interfaces

25
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,380
such that different logical interface
can be given to a different VM.

26
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,800
The architecture versions that
encapsulate these modifications

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,876
are referred to as VT-x for the
modifications along the first vector.

28
00:01:59,876 --> 00:02:06,260
With a VT-x2, VT-x3 occurring in
subsequent generations of processors.

29
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:12,290
Then VT-d for the advances along the
second dimension with VT-d following and

30
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:17,790
so forth, and then the architecture
modifications along the third vector

31
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:24,010
are encapsulated into what's referred to
as IOVs or IO virtualization technology.

32
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,890
And VMDq what stands for
virtual machine device queue's, so

33
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,970
this is device residence support.
