1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,610
Couple of things I want all of you to start playing around with if you can, and

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,090
it would be great for you to start doing this on your own if you

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,080
have the old Python-OpenCV installation.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,720
And again, we will be providing a browser-based way of doing some of this stuff,

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,680
the simpler stuff.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,840
So, you can actually try to do testing of loading images and

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,030
stuff like that on your own, within a browser.

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,610
But again, we do encourage you to set up a whole platform for

9
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,635
yourselves on your computers so you can start doing some of this on your own.

10
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:29,730
I would encourage you to play around with these types of things on your own.

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,190
On Python basically, or

12
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:36,200
OpenCV you can import the OpenCV framework by just typing in import cv2.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,930
And you can read input images of any form and also write them out.

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:41,709
And play around and

15
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,590
again, as I said, different aspects of doing these types of things.

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,600
In Matlab the same thing is possible.

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,750
On what you can basically just read images and you can also write them out.

18
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,930
There are other functions you can play around in Matlab including, for

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,320
example, showing the images.

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,710
But I encourage you again, to play around and get used to this.

21
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,310
I'm not talking about processing in this lesson here.

22
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:08,370
But again, there is a lot of documentation available for processing online.

23
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,960
Just a couple other pointers here, you can actually start looking at

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,660
the sizes of images, color channels, bits per pixel information.

25
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,560
Again, both in Matlab and in OpenCV Python, there are ways of

26
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,840
being able to do this and seeing what kind of details you can come up with.
