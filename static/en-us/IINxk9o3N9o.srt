1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,250
In your pitch perfect Xcode project
select the main doc storyboard file.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,939
This is your storyboard,

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,740
the place where you'll set up
your entire user interface.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,630
Here you will eventually see the entire
interface, all of the interface

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,440
elements, and the view controllers
associated with interfaces.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,790
You can see this app only
has one interface and

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,350
one view controller,
named ViewController.

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,150
A couple of key things to notice,

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,140
the first is the light gray arrow
on the left side of this view.

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,470
This signifies that this is
the initial view controller for

11
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,010
the storyboard and
in fact for the application.

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,530
When the user starts this app,
this is the first view controller and

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,780
view that will load.

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,610
On the bottom right side you can see the
library selector would different types

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,390
of user interface
elements we can drag in.

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,300
If you don't see the library make
sure the third icon from the left is

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,230
selected, the one that looks
like two concentric circles.

18
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,710
You can hide the debug area as
well as the navigator panel

19
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,480
to give us some more screen
real estate as Iâ€™ve done here.

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,670
Before we can drag a button then this
view needs to be at 100% zoomed in.

21
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,800
Double click on the header
here to do that.

22
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,470
Let's start by dragging in a button
to this user interface element.

23
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,200
On the bottom right scroll and
select a button or search for

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,570
it by typing UI button.

25
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,840
Drag the button to the center of the
screen using the two blue bar guidelines

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,060
to center it horizontally and
vertically.

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,410
Now we come to the first problem
most beginning iOS developers face.

28
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,840
The background of this button is white.

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,900
The UI view behind it is also white.

30
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,529
If you click away,
how can you tell how big the button is?

31
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,260
One trick that I use is to temporarily
change the background of the button so

32
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,620
you can easily see how big it is and
where it is on the view.

33
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,900
This is also a great chance for

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,510
you to play around a little bit
with the attributes inspector.

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,750
With the button selected,
here on the left,

36
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:04,160
click on the attributes inspector and
scroll down until you see background.

37
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,350
Select the drop down and pick a color.

38
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,940
I've chosen bright green color for
the background of this button.

39
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,300
The more visible the better.

40
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,970
You're not going for
aesthetics just yet.

41
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,690
Now we can see our
button is pretty small.

42
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,149
And we can easily see what
would happen if you re-size it.

43
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,430
Double click on the button and
change the text to record.

44
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,810
Go ahead and grab the button and
drag it out, so

45
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,010
you can see the entire
word being displayed.

46
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,290
While we're at it, here's another tip.

47
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,786
If you had a hard time selecting the
button, you can use the document outline

48
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:38,890
view in interface builder part of Xcode
to find the UI button and select it.

49
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,630
That's this view here, on the left.

50
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,330
You can hide and

51
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,380
show the document outline by clicking
on this button here on the bottom left.

52
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,100
The next step is to set up
the layout for the button.

53
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,910
And for that we've got to talk
briefly about auto layout.
