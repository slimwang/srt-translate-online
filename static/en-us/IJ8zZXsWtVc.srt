The answer is a disc shaped volume, a pretty flat cylinder. Whatever axis you

2
00:00:04,564 --> 00:00:08,984
rotate around, each point will trace out a circle perpendicular to this axis,

3
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:13,100
with the center at the origin. It's useful to think about the axis of rotation

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,850
this way. For example, if you have a location and want to rotate it to another

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,140
location, find the circle that has its center at the origin and contains these

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,263
two points. The circle's corresponding axis is the one to rotate around.
