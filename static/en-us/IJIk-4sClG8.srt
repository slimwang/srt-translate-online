1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,880
With the pen and
paper still in your hand, go ahead and

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,210
sketch out what each option
would look like on a device.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,470
You can refer to the view hierarchy
diagrams that we created in the last

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,330
quiz, if that helps you.

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,860
Also, as you're reading
through each XML file,

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,950
make sure that you read each attribute
carefully, so you don't miss anything.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,010
When you're done with those three
sketches, I want you to decide on which

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,890
option gives you the desired
layout that we want.

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,620
These are radio buttons instead of
check boxes, so you can only pick one.

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,120
Good luck.
