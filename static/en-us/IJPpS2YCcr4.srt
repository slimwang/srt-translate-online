1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,000
Here is the answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,800
No.

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,590
If you replace four with par four,
the algorithm will be incorrect.

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,640
Replacing four with par four
is a bit like running with

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,840
running with scissors, don't do that.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,738
If by chance you've taken
the other awesome systems and

7
00:00:13,738 --> 00:00:16,800
architecture courses that
are a part of the OMSCS.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,970
Then you probably know about
multithreading and locks.

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,280
You could use those constructs to
protect these updates to the variable K.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,030
But were you to do so, you really
wouldn't get much parallelism anyway,

11
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,990
because any simultaneous threads would
most likely contend for the lock.

12
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,450
I think what we need is a different and
more algorithmic approach.
