1
00:00:00,052 --> 00:00:02,613
So lets take a look at our Jersey Square team as

2
00:00:02,613 --> 00:00:05,155
an example and see how they came up with their

3
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:07,693
value proposition. Now, whats interesting is if

4
00:00:07,693 --> 00:00:10,636
you remember value proposition describes not

5
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:13,090
only the features but also the pains and gains

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,615
that they see, that theyve actually craved for the

7
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:18,502
customer and that the goal is to figure out what

8
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:20,003
the MVP is.

9
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:21,949
And if we see the Jersey Square team,

10
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,834
they actually did a pretty good job talking

11
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:26,695
about pains and gains, a cheaper way to wear

12
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:29,625
officially licensed sports jerseys to a game,

13
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,057
to eliminate the risk of owning a players jersey

14
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:34,475
who is going to be traded, or to provide an

15
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:36,801
alternative to purchasing counterfeit jerseys.

16
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:38,620
Pretty good for pains and gains.

17
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,358
But what they forgot to describe is what are the

18
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:42,436
features and just so we could remember the

19
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:44,722
features for Jersey Square is they were going to

20
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:47,722
provide a single place where you could rent sports

21
00:00:47,722 --> 00:00:50,258
jerseys, so you wouldnt have to own them and

22
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:53,074
maintain them to visit your favorite team.

23
00:00:53,074 --> 00:00:55,317
And what they also missed is what was the

24
00:00:55,317 --> 00:00:58,585
MVP or minimum viable product of what they

25
00:00:58,585 --> 00:01:00,268
were going to build. And in their case it was

26
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:03,697
going to be a website with rental and a stock of

27
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,864
jerseys of the most popular teams at first in the

28
00:01:06,864 --> 00:01:09,232
New York area and then nationally in the United

29
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:11,999
States and then ultimately internationally.

30
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:13,417
So those were kind of missing, but again

31
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:15,286
starting with pains and gains was pretty

32
00:01:15,286 --> 00:01:17,203
good for their value proposition.

33
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:19,320
Notice by the way, while they were working on

34
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,747
value proposition, they also had some

35
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:25,887
hypothesis about the customer segments.

36
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:28,862
And this is a key idea, value proposition and

37
00:01:28,862 --> 00:01:31,610
customer segments are the first two things you

38
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,745
tend to work on with the business model canvas.

39
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:36,263
Because these two have a special name called

40
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,395
product market fit. And product market fit just

41
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:42,802
simply says what is the match between what you

42
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,500
are building and what customers need and

43
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,366
want, and who are those customers.

44
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:49,896
So, while the goal in value prop is to figure out

45
00:01:49,896 --> 00:01:51,869
the MVP, yes, well see later the goal in

46
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,284
customer segments is to figure out who and

47
00:01:55,284 --> 00:01:58,083
what the archetype of the customer is. So again

48
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,439
you could start either with customer segments or

49
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,821
you could start with a product and value prop

50
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:06,251
itself, it really doesnt matter. But in most teams

51
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,203
if they are technology driven, they tend to start

52
00:02:09,203 --> 00:02:11,552
on value prop and most teams if they happen to

53
00:02:11,552 --> 00:02:14,337
be marketers or business people, happen to start

54
00:02:14,337 --> 00:02:16,471
with the customer segments. There is no right

55
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:20,853
place, but its the interaction between these two.
