1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,426
This answer choice is correct. There are 2 groups of people, and so that way

2
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:09,239
researchers can compare how well the active pill helped people sleep compared to

3
00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:13,945
the inactive pill. In this particular experiment, we can't really test for side

4
00:00:13,957 --> 00:00:18,228
effects of the active pill, and also in this experiment, researchers aren't

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,431
really concerned if the inactive pill can help people sleep. To figure this out

6
00:00:22,443 --> 00:00:26,493
they would have to compare the effects of the inactive pill to something else.

7
00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:30,630
But the purpose is to find out how well the active pill will help people sleep.
