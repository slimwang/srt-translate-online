00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:04,698
So, to summarize what we can say about function behavior, or at least this

2
00:00:04,698 --> 00:00:09,600
aspect of it. If the value of the function goes down as the value of x goes up,

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,230
then we say that the function is decreasing. Just like over here where it's

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,497
sloping down. Now if instead f of x increases as x increases, then we say that

5
00:00:18,497 --> 00:00:22,840
the function is increasing. Like in this part of the graph. The third option is

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,246
that f of x doesn't change at all as x increases. Here, f of x is a constant. So

7
00:00:28,246 --> 00:00:32,341
here I've drawn another sort of silly looking graph, and I'm going to divide it

8
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:37,037
into several regions. So for each of the regions of the domain that I've split

9
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,369
up right here on the left, I'd like you to tell me if in that range in the

10
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:46,309
domain, the function, which is g of x in this case, is increasing, decreasing,

11
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:50,426
or a constant? Please pick one of these 3 values for each part of the domain.
