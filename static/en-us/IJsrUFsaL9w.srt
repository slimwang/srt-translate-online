1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:06,230
Here it is. H of x equals 5 to the x. But what points lie on this function?

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,998
Let's figure it out. Here's a table for you to fill out, so that we can

3
00:00:08,998 --> 00:00:12,920
organize this information well. However, in order to do this, you're probably

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,842
going to need to use a calculator. Since the numbers are going to get really

5
00:00:17,842 --> 00:00:22,284
big, really fast. If you don't own a calculator, it's easy to find one online

6
00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:26,872
by searching for scientific calculator. And if you do have your own scientific

7
00:00:26,872 --> 00:00:31,340
calculator. It should have a button that makes evaluating exponential functions

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,286
very simple. In fact, Google makes a calculator that's very easy to find and

9
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:41,079
very easy to use. Here it is. It comes up right when you search scientific

10
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:46,479
calculator on Google. This is what I'll be using today to do our calculations.

11
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:51,010
As you can see, this calculator has a button that says x to the y on it. Now if

12
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:57,612
I want to calculate six to the third power, for example, I would press 6. Then

13
00:00:57,612 --> 00:01:01,626
I would press x to the y. And then I would press three. You can see that the

14
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:05,941
calculator is showing us 6 to the 3rd. When I press equals, that gives me the

15
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:10,520
number that's equal to, which is 216. Let's try another one. Maybe I want to

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,474
find four to the negative fifth. Well, I press four, then our lovely x to the y

17
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:20,046
button, and then I type negative 5. Great, I see 4 to the negative 5th, which

18
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:23,926
is what we're looking for. Pressing Enter tells me that it's this long

19
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:28,506
exponent. Let's practice using that button on our calculator to find different

20
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:33,190
points on this function. For each value of x, I've written here, please fill in

21
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:38,316
the corresponding value of h of x. In other words find 5 to the x for each of

22
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:40,090
these x values.
