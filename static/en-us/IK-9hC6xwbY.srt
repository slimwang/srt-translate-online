1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,958
So you just checked 1 and negative 1 off our list of possible rational zeros

2
00:00:03,958 --> 00:00:08,119
for this function. We know that neither one of these works. So let's move o to

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,841
one of our next four possibilities. Why don't we try out one half? Is one half

4
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:14,883
a root or a zero of this function?
