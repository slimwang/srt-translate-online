1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,290
Now this duality between a spine and

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,180
binary arithmetic is the key
to understanding how to

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,260
perform all these operations on bags
like insert, union and splitting.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,540
Let's start with binary math.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,604
Suppose you want to compute 23 + 1,
but do it in base 2.

6
00:00:17,604 --> 00:00:20,135
Let's start by writing out 23 and
1 in binary.

7
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:28,700
So here's what you did in
computer science preschool.

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:34,082
See 1 + 1 is 0, carry the 1, 1 + 1 is 0,

9
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:39,720
carry the 1, 1 + 1 is 0, carry the 1.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,920
Finally, a little variety.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,700
1 + 0 is 1 with no carry,
and finally drop the 1.

12
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,430
Let's see, so did we get this right?

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:53,854
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 16 + 8 is 24.

14
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:54,713
Voila.

15
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,593
Now, if you want to put
a single element into a bag,

16
00:01:04,593 --> 00:01:08,650
you're going to do the morally
equivalent thing to binary addition.

17
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,210
Let's see an example.

18
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,180
Suppose you have a bag with 23 elements
and you want to insert a new element.

19
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,090
First, try to put it into the least
significant bit of the spine.

20
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,170
Rats, there's already a pennant there.

21
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,280
Okay, no big deal.

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,960
Let's create a new pennant
of twice the size.

23
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,770
The only gotcha now is that this
pennant is in the wrong place.

24
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,160
It's trying to occupy a slot along
the spine for pennants of size 1.

25
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,060
So, we'll need to carry
it into the next slot and

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,570
replace the current slot
with a null pointer.

27
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,590
Now let's repeat the process and try to
insert this new pennant into slot one.

28
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,080
Again, the slot's occupied so
we gotta move on.

29
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,699
Let's combine the 2 size 2 pennants
into a size 4 pennant, carry it, and

30
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:50,009
then 0 out the slot.

31
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,322
And then you basically just keep
going til the pennant that you're

32
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:57,250
carrying eventually reaches
a spot where you can insert it.

33
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,570
So here's a question,
what's the cost of doing this insertion?
