1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,550
Now let's build on an example using the simple point arithmetic.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,850
Let's say I get this image, image one.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,850
Here I have Einstein, I was coming, visiting the office, and

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,822
he's sitting in front of, on the desk here.

5
00:00:11,822 --> 00:00:15,190
And now what I actually want to also do is kind in tract with this image.

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,520
But Einstein, actually, before he visited,

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,990
I was able to take a picture of the same location before Einstein came in.

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,770
So now I have two images, Image 2 and Image 1, here there's no Einstein.

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,570
There is of course Einstein.

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,354
So now the question is, by just doing simple point arithmetic,

11
00:00:32,354 --> 00:00:36,680
or pixel additions and subtractions and such at each and every pixel.

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,170
Again these two images are the same size,

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,670
can I actually now find interesting information between these two images?

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,400
So by just doing subtraction of this first image from the second image what

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,480
will we get?

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,780
We will basically now be getting all of the pixels that actually have

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,730
changed from first to the second.

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,780
So this actually becomes an example of almost doing something which is

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,019
referred to either as change detection or you on background subtraction.

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,350
So using this I should be able to figure out all of the pixels that

21
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,330
are in this image, that are also in this image by subtracting it.

22
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,205
But then all the pixels I should find are the ones that have

23
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:16,860
changed from one to the other.

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,340
Of course, in this case, I've taken the exact same images,

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,740
the location of each and every part of this image is the same as this one.

26
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,810
That is, you can imagine this camera was on a tripod, did not move at all, and

27
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,330
was a controlled situation.

28
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,090
So of course, they're exactly the same background, and

29
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,660
therefore I can do background segmentation or background separation.

30
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:42,700
So by just doing a simple point arithmetic of Image 1 by Image 2,

31
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,400
I get, just all of the pixels.

32
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,690
Again, I haven't, I mean, this is an illustrative example.

33
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,510
I haven't actually done clean-up or anything else like that.

34
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,570
But you'll notice that all of the pixels that get highlighted are the ones where

35
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,150
Einstein is.

36
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,650
So now you start seeing the pixels over here, and

37
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,310
of course these are the ones I wanted.

38
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,680
I wanted to find all of these but I did not want to find these.

39
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,760
So, basically now I want to find all the red parts, but not the green ones.

40
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,220
Of course, this gives me that result, gives me all the pixels, and

41
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,750
of course, now I can do, start doing various types of processing on this one.

42
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,630
Here's an example.

43
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,890
One, I can basically just look for the ones and zeroes.

44
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,590
That is, everywhere there is a value of certain things, I basically say,

45
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,590
okay, make it be black.

46
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,900
So all of the smaller values become black.

47
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,000
All of the bigger values that are closer to much more you know,

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,390
the white of things, become white.

49
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,260
So this becomes 1, this is 0, becomes a binary image.

50
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,610
And I can run this process, between, the subtraction that I have,

51
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,480
between the two images.

52
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,370
And this allows me to now find pixels, which basically are where Einstein is.

53
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,810
Now, I know those of you paying attention to this,

54
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,410
you should have gotten the head and all that kind of stuff correctly.

55
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,345
It kind of implies that in some of my computations I didn't pay attention.

56
00:02:54,345 --> 00:02:57,980
Again, I'm showing this as an illustrative example more than anything else.
