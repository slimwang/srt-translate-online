1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,160
Just like with the t test, the f test and correlation, and regression, to do

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,200
hypothesis testing we need to find our degrees of freedom. What do you think

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,700
the degrees of freedom will be in this case? You've seen something like this

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,900
before in lesson 10. As a hint, let's pretend that we don't know any of the

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,820
observed direct expected frequencies and we just know the marginal totals. How

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,710
many of these four boxes could we choose any way we want, such that we can

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,950
still have these marginal totals? In instructor notes, I put a link to this

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,060
quiz in lesson ten, if you want to review that before answering this quiz.
