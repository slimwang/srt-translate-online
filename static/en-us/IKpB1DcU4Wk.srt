1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,150
There is no cloud,
it's just someone else's computer.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,840
This is a meme that has been floating
around the internet for a while and

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,300
it's true and it's fine,
realizing that can actually help.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,600
It's just a computer.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,420
So you can do the same things
you already know how to do,

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,850
like run virtual machines on it.

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:23,490
But since it's someone else's computer,
they will take care of the hardware.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,930
While there are some companies that
maintain their own private clouds,

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,090
most people use a cloud
that is run by others.

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,540
There are a lot of
options to choose from.

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,670
Large public cloud providers,
small specialized providers,

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,710
open source projects that
let you host your own cloud.

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,550
It's hard to pick what to use.

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,720
Let's explore the most popular options.
