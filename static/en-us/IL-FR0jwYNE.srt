1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,419
In this lesson,
we learned how to use material design

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,379
to give our app a consistent style
with different colors and texts.

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,039
And we created responsive
user interfaces

4
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:14,449
that work across a variety of different
screen sizes and configurations.

5
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:18,899
The next and last step will be to
apply what we've learned to Sunshine.

6
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:22,772
So in the next few section you'll be
given some guidance on the styles, and

7
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:26,096
layout configurations you'll
need to include to give Sunshine

8
00:00:26,096 --> 00:00:27,519
some final visual polish.
