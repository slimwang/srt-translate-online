1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,040
Kunal, we missed you in
the last interview with Kirill.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,420
>> I know, I should have been there.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,650
I'll do the next one for sure.

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,220
>> Okay.
But you know what?

5
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,290
>> What?
>> We finished lesson one.

6
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:08,840
>> No.

7
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,690
>> Yeah, we're done.

8
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,060
>> You're telling me we're one-third
of the way through the course?

9
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:13,940
>> Yeah.
>> Oh, that's great.

10
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,730
>> And you know what we should do now?

11
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,230
No.

12
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,970
>> We should recap.

13
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,480
>> We should.

14
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,950
>> So the first part of the lesson
we learn about how a screen

15
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:22,960
is made of different views.

16
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,830
>> Yep, image view and text view.

17
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,170
>> And
we learned how to style those views.

18
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,690
>> So if you want to change
the color of a text for instance.

19
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,580
And in the final bit,
what we did was took different views and

20
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,380
put them together.

21
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,190
So we call them view groups.

22
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,762
We use linear layout, relative layout,
we use margin and padding.

23
00:00:36,762 --> 00:00:38,027
Yup, so we're done now.

24
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:38,759
>> And that's Lesson 1.

25
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:39,815
All right.
[SOUND]

26
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:40,755
>> Nice.

27
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:45,951
>> I got a chilled raspberry
fruit loop tea for

28
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:50,577
Kunol, and green tea for Catherine.

29
00:00:50,577 --> 00:00:53,940
You know, they haven't even really
talked about Android Studio.

30
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,700
Let's fix that.
