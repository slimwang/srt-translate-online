1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,130
And there are 2 correct answers here.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:06,130
One is that we can use non determinism to guess a shortest tour.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,380
It's not totally obvious how to do that, because the if-better function

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,470
always can only do 2 distinctions,

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,190
so you have to find a clever way to use that function to guess

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,410
how to construct a shortest tour,

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,170
but it's possible in the way that I've showed you here.

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,700
Then once the shortest tour has been guessed,

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,060
checking if the length is shorter than

10
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,760
D, and as you'll remember, D was the maximum length that we allow for it,

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,700
because we are having shortest tour in the decision problem.

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,570
Once the shortest tour has been guessed,

13
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,680
it's easy to check if the length of that tour is smaller than D,

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,850
so by easy, I mean it's possible in polynomial time,

15
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,390
so this one here is also correct.

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,250
Non determinism can be used to guess

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,120
which vertices to put in the tour

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,430
is--obviously doesn't make sense, because all vertices are part of the tour.

19
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,650
It's the order of the vertices

20
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,230
that matters for solving shortest tour.

21
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,340
And then the final one, of course, that was easy to see that

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,390
it's not really a viable answer,

23
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,990
but I wanted to point out to you that

24
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,760
even though it might sometimes be obvious,

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
you should always make sure

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,170
to explicitly show that the problem is in NP,

27
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,290
and we'll actually, later in this course,

28
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,130
come across some problems where you might initially think that they are in NP

29
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,270
but actually they're much harder than problems that are in NP.

30
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,310
So now, we have completed the first step.

31
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,380
We know that shortest tour is in NP

32
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,620
and now consider finding a polynomial time reduction

33
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,760
from an NP complete problem

34
00:01:21,760 --> 99:59:59,999
to show shortest tour is NP complete.
