1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,212
In the past few minutes we've touched on a
lot of concepts that are going to play a

2
00:00:04,224 --> 00:00:08,007
really central role in the rest of the
course and really in all math going

3
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:12,194
forwards from here. So I would like to do
a review of the algebra vocabulary that

4
00:00:12,206 --> 00:00:16,046
we've covered so far. I think it's
actually going to amaze you how much we've

5
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:20,258
already gone over in a pretty short amount
of time. So first thing first, we have

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,800
numbers, as one might expect in math. So
what are some examples of numbers? Well,

7
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:29,215
we could have any number of things. So
like we learned in the very beginning of

8
00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:33,738
this course, they're all different kinds
of numbers. Some that are pretty simple

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,253
and we use all the time, like 0 or 1 or
46, and some that are a little bit more

10
00:00:38,265 --> 00:00:43,084
special, like the root of 2 or pi. Then in
contrast to numbers, we also learned about

11
00:00:43,096 --> 00:00:48,125
variables. So, here we have all different
kinds of symbols, we have some letters, we

12
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:50,857
have some sillier things like hearts and
smiley faces, we got some greek letters.

13
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:55,919
But regardless of what we write variables
as they all have the same purpose, as we

14
00:00:55,931 --> 00:01:00,528
learned earlier. Variables are symbols
that we use in equations and expressions

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,562
that serve as slots into which we can plug
other numbers to make our expressions take

16
00:01:05,574 --> 00:01:09,959
on different values. So comparing numbers
and variables, numbers have fixed values.

17
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:14,413
They inherently show certain quantities.
Variables, however, don't show outright

18
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:18,721
what they stand for, they're just place
holders into which we can insert different

19
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:22,655
numbers. One thing to take note of when
we're looking at what's inside each of

20
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:27,479
these circles is that we actually have a
symbol on the number side. That's this pi

21
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:31,773
right here. Since pi is an irrational
number, it extends for an infinite number

22
00:01:31,785 --> 00:01:35,822
of decimal points. Now, it took me an
awfully long time to write all of this

23
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:40,123
out. So if I were to write even more, that
would take me even longer. To make our

24
00:01:40,135 --> 00:01:44,131
lives much more simple, we give this
infinitely long number a special name,

25
00:01:44,227 --> 00:01:48,869
which is pi. A similar thing happens when
we write square roots. We have a number,

26
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:53,451
2, right here but we also have a square
root sign over it. Since the root of 2 is

27
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:57,858
also an irrational number the square root
sign is just another way of taking a

28
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,139
shortcut to not have to write out an
infinite number of decimals. So bottom

29
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:06,798
line, when you see symbols, they're almost
always variables. They'll be certain

30
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,783
cases. Which you'll become well acquainted
with when you see things like pi or like a

31
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:15,189
square root sign that are symbols of some
sort but represent numbers.
