1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,750
Whatever system you choose to build your
game, take advantage of the objects and

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,920
patterns it provides to decouple
the pieces and simplify development.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,240
These might be special abstract data
types that hide private data, or

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,510
a type safe way to pass
messages between game objects.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,540
There might be a built-in mechanism to
create actors or items in the world, or

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,990
maybe even behaviors that can
be attached to these objects.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,210
The system might provide object pooling
to automatically recycle unused items

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,550
and optimize memory usage.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,730
If you're using a game engine or library
that includes features like these,

10
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,470
they can greatly speed development and

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,970
usually end up making your code
more robust in the process.

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,370
You don't have to build these
components from scratch, and

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,120
you don't have to debug them usually.

14
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,960
Even if you're not using
a game development framework,

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,980
the programming language you choose may
offer features that can help you create

16
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,830
solid game code.

17
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,140
Type safety, object-oriented features
like classes and interfaces.

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,390
Private data access,
threat synchronization mechanisms,

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,000
memory management,
standard collection types.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,150
These are all useful features that
can reduce your coding burden.
