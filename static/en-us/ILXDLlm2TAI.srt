00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,790
Now that we have one point, let's find some more. The slope of negative 2, since

2
00:00:04,802 --> 00:00:09,650
negative 2 is the coefficient of the x term, so it is m in this equation, tells

3
00:00:09,662 --> 00:00:14,535
us that for every one unit we move to the right, we need to move down negative 2

4
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:19,510
units. Thinking about the point that we already know in the slope, can you name

5
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:22,160
another point that should lie on this line?
