1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,810
In the MainActivity, 
we tell the forecast fragment

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,900
to use a special today layout
if it's one pane mode.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,643
In the fragment, 
we pass on this value

4
00:00:07,643 --> 00:00:09,926
to the forecast adapter,
if it's not null.

5
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:13,020
The reason it could be null,
is because the activity onCreate method

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,059
will happen before the fragment
onCreateView method.

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,000
And this is where 
the forecast adapter is initialized.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,100
So we set the Boolean here as well.

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,820
The reason we have this code here
is because it's a public method.

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,590
So, in the future it could be called
before or after this method.
