00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,060
thing that's needed is to add a default

The default container

00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,850
You go to the Versions tab, up here,

00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,070
and you see the different versions
that have been published.

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,897
You go to the latest one that's
actually published live,

00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:26,207
click the Actions menu to see
the options, and choose Download.

And you see it's downloaded.

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,330
So, it's your turn now to
download your container and

00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,950
then check here when you're done.
