1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's take a look. Here is one possible reading.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm going to take 1 and subtract 2 so I have negative 1 plus 3,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and that's going to give me 2, so 2 is definitely an answer.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If I do 1 - 2 first, I'll have -1 plus 3.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
However, what if I want to do this 2 + 3 first?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'll have 1 minus 2 plus 3 or 1 minus 5.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's going to give me -4.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Zero and 4 aren't really reachable using this expression,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
but depending on whether you do the subtraction first or the addition first,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
you could either get 2 or -4. This sentence is ambiguous.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We're not sure what it means or it has multiple meanings

12
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
just like the Jane Austen binoculars example from before.
