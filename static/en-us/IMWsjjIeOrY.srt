1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,310
So let's talk about something called scatter plots.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,250
And I'm going to use the car example.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,136
When we drove our car we had days when the train was completely flat,

4
00:00:10,136 --> 00:00:12,120
let's us drive very fast.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,870
Sometimes we encountered a little bit of bumpiness or a lot of bumpiness.

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,500
Which kind of forces us to slow down.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,420
So one way in which our terrain was able to vary, was at the level of bumpiness.

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,220
Which could go from smooth, to really bad.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,450
Second dimension, which our terrain varied had to do with slope.

10
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,880
Could be flat.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,940
Or, they were different levels of steepness.

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,530
I'm obviously slightly exaggerating here.

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,710
So it goes from flat to very steep.

14
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,930
And, again, the steeper it is the slower we wish to drive.

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,900
And, those things could co-occur,

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,390
as shown in these speed graphs on the right side.

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,430
So what I want to do with you is just map these training examples over here,

18
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:05,830
of say a flat, smooth vote, into our diagram over here.

19
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,890
And I give you nine possible points that correspond to

20
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,780
all the combinations of the three bumpiness levels we encountered.

21
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,850
And the three slope levels.

22
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:22,550
And when I ask you to take a car set away from, like, this one and then define

23
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:27,030
the correct of the nine items that best represents the situation over here
