00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,680
Before we end this lesson, I want to draw several connections.

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,450
The first has to do with memory. We have often said that memory is an integral

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:16,860
part of the cognitive systems architecture. One can imagine that A and

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,436
B are stood in a memory. Then C and 1, and C and 2, and C and 3, and so

5
00:00:21,436 --> 00:00:26,920
on, are probes into the memory. And the question would then become,

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,260
which one of these probes is most similar to what's stored in memory?

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,220
We may decide on that answer based on some similarity metric.

8
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:40,810
In fact we'll revisit this exactly the same issue when we talk about case-based

9
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,040
reasoning later on in this class. Another connection we can draw here has to do

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,200
with reasoning. When we are talking about the transformation from A to B and

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,320
then the transformation to from C to 1 of these choices, one question that arose

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,200
was should we make the connection between the outer circle here and B?

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,920
Or the inner circle and A and B. This is a correspondence problem.

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,970
The correspondence problem is: given two situations, what object in one

15
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,540
situation corresponds to what object in another situation? We will come

16
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,110
across this problem again when we discuss analogical reason a little bit later.

17
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,230
The third connection has to do with cognition, of knowledge based AI as a whole.

18
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,530
Notice that instead of just talking about properties of objects,

19
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,320
like this is a circle and the size of the circle,

20
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,400
our emphasis here has been on the relationships between the objects.

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,780
The fact that this is inside the outer circle, or the fact that the outer circle

22
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,350
remains the same here, the inner circle disappears. In knowledge-based AI and

23
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,600
in cognition in general, the focus is always on relationships,

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,280
not just on objects and the features of those objects.
