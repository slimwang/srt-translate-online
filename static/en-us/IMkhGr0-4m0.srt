00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,030
Let me actually now start giving
you more details about what coded

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,380
photography could mean.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,770
Here, I'm basically just
showing you a single image,

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:12,400
one photograph of basically some
bottles, some cans, and a pack of chips.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,050
If I just take this one picture, what
I'd like to be able to get out of this

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,590
is basically some sort of a depth map.

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,599
Now, we've looked at how
to compute depth, and

8
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:23,840
we've talked about how to compute depth
by taking two images, a stereo pair.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,960
And we can compute something like this.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,274
Imagine in one image,
we can actually now decode it,

11
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:34,223
to be able to get information that gives
you depth in some detail like this.

12
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:38,844
Another example we can play with
is where just the same single

13
00:00:38,844 --> 00:00:43,580
input image can allow us to now
compute a all-focused image.

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,910
Everything in this, er, all layers of
this image are now completely focused.

15
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,950
Here you can see a little bit
of blurriness in this image,

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,550
because of defocusing.

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,290
Or you know,
some of this is also defocused.

18
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,690
But here each and every part when
you cans see there are multiple

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,640
layers of this one all are focused.

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,160
You can basically look at a little bit
of close ups, see what I mean by this.

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,405
More detail,
more crispness at all levels here,

22
00:01:05,405 --> 00:01:07,579
this one is of course defocused.
