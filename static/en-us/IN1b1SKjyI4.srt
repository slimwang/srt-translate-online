1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:09,018
When we divide 7 by 16, we get 0.4375. And
when we divide 1 by 3, we get 0.3

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:18,516
repeating. If we round this to five
decimal places, we get 0.33333. Though, of

3
00:00:18,528 --> 00:00:25,057
course, this is just an approximation of
the actual fraction. So with this problem,

4
00:00:25,183 --> 00:00:31,192
we see two different types of decimals.
Terminating decimals like .4375 and

5
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:37,164
repeating decimals like .3 repeating.
Decimals of these 2 types can always be

6
00:00:37,176 --> 00:00:42,245
written as fractions. So that means they
are rational numbers.
