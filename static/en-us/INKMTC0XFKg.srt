00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,286
The x coordinate should be 9. We can follow the y axis down to negative 8, and

2
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:10,703
then stay on that horizontal line, y equals negative 8, all the way over until

3
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:15,705
it intersects our line. That happens at this point right here. If you go

4
00:00:15,717 --> 00:00:21,122
directly upward from that point to the x axis, you see that the x coordinate is

5
00:00:21,134 --> 00:00:26,613
coming from the origin outward 9. We could also check this by substituting

6
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:31,578
negative 8 into our equation in the spot of y, and then solving for x.
