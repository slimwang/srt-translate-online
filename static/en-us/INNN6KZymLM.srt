00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This question tests how well you understand the Diffie-Hellman key-agreement protocol.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The first two statements are the security of the scheme depends on it being difficult to solve

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
a^x = b mod n for a given b, n and x.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The security of the scheme depends on it being different to solve

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
a^x = b mod n for x given a, b, and n.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The last two statements are if the value used for g in the Diffie-Hellman scheme

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
is not a generator or a primitive root, the participants might not agree on the same key.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The last statement--if the modulus n is not prime, the Diffie-Hellman scheme

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
would still be correct, meaning two participants produce the same key,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but it might not be secure. Check all that apply.
