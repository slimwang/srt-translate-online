1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,730
Third module, we're actually going to look inside the camera.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,140
We will look at the basic foundations of a camera using a pinhole

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,460
camera concept.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,590
We will learn more about the importance of optics, how does and you know,

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,149
various types of lenses, what kind of a role they play in photography.

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,140
And what computation has to do with them.

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,450
And also the basics of how does a camera work.

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,270
We learn more about sensors within a camera, again, these are the represent,

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,340
these are the systems that will take the information that a camera has and

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,800
converts them to digital information that we want to do some things with.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,200
And in this one, we learn about concepts of epsilon photography and

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,480
also a fun experiment that you will do is try to build your own pin hole or

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,349
a camera obscura.
