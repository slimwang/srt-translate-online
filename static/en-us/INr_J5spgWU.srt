1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,255
Now, where were we with Grant? Oh, that's right, he was on the plane. He's on

2
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:08,586
the plane going from home to the Cxpo in the city Udacity. But Grant is super

3
00:00:08,598 --> 00:00:13,119
impatient and he would really love to find out where the halfway point between

4
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:17,312
his hometown and Udacity is. He found out earlier that the exact distance

5
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:21,918
between these 2 points is the square root of 530,000, in miles, of course. So,

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,542
he just measure half of the square root of 530000 along this line, that doesn't

7
00:00:26,554 --> 00:00:30,927
seem like a very exact or very easy to do either. But just by looking at our

8
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:35,774
graph, I'd like you to give me an estimate for the midpoint is. That is, what if

9
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:40,373
a coordinates of the point that's halfway between these 2 points along this

10
00:00:40,385 --> 00:00:40,662
line?
