00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,510
Before we finish this lesson,
I wanted to summarize things and

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,980
tell you how this all fits in
to machine learning for trading.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,460
The first thing to point out here is
that bagging and boosting are just

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:17,460
methods for taking existing learners and
essentially wrapping them in this

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,460
meta algorithm that converts your
existing learner into an ensemble.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,640
And you should use the same
API to call your ensemble

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,390
that you would have earlier been
using to call an individual learner.

8
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,650
So externally, to whatever part of
your program is calling the learner,

9
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,385
it doesn't know that underneath there
you're doing boosting or bagging.

10
00:00:40,385 --> 00:00:45,690
Your resulting learner is also likely
to lower error and reduced overfitage.

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,020
So to summarize, boosting and
bagging are not new algorithms in and

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,340
of themselves.

13
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,455
They're meta algorithms that
let you wrap your underlying

14
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:57,330
learning algorithms into
something that's better.

15
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,180
Okay, that's it for this lesson.

16
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,620
I will see you again soon.

17
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,120
Bye bye.
