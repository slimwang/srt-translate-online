1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
So given that the greedy algorithm takes 57 instead of 24, what's the approximation factor

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,490
for this concrete example here where the approximation constant?

3
00:00:11,490 --> 99:59:59,999
And I would like to enter your answer here and please give me 2 digits after the decimal.
