00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,610
Alright, so I want to relate my band object to my stage object.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:03,920
>> Right.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,990
>> So I'm guessing I'm going to drag either look up or master detail.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,670
>> Yep.

5
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,020
>> And I know we're into some trouble

6
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,880
with that earlier so, which one should I use?

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,020
>> There's are a lot of differences between the look up and the

8
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,260
master detail, but one of the core differences, is that a look up

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,160
relationship is not a required field

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,110
whereas with the master detail, its automatically

11
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,350
required. And since, in the case of our schema, a band might necessarily

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,460
be created without already being booked, to a

13
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,920
stage or scheduled for a stage, so we'd want

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,750
to choose look-up in that case, so it doesn't

15
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,710
require that field when you create a band record.

16
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,250
>> Okay.
