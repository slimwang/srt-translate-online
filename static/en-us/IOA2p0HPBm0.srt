00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,130
>> So going back to our earlier problem, if a times b equals 15, and a plus b

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,555
equals negative 8, then what are the values of a and b. Just to remind you in

3
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:13,175
case it's not completely clear right away, it doesn't which number we call a and

4
00:00:13,175 --> 00:00:17,535
which number we call b. As long as we have the two right numbers that satisfy

5
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:18,835
these two equations.
