00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,433
In this lesson, we're going to extend our knowledge of solving radical

2
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:08,890
equations. This time our radical equations will lead to a quadratic equation.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,418
We'll apply the same strategy of isolating the radical on one side, and then

4
00:00:12,418 --> 00:00:17,203
we'll raise both sides of the equation to the index of that radical. For

5
00:00:17,203 --> 00:00:20,636
example, if we have this radical equation? What will we get if we get if we

6
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:23,160
square the left side and the right side?
