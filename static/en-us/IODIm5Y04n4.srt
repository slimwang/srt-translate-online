1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,460
The second choice is the correct one. As x gets bigger and bigger, going toward

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,685
positive infinity, the graph is getting closer and closer to the line y equals

3
00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:13,915
zero from above the X axis. And as x gets closer and closer to negative

4
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:18,217
infinity, over here on the left side of the graph. The curve of a rational

5
00:00:18,217 --> 00:00:23,270
function is also getting closer to y equals zero but from the bottom this time.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,720
In either case however, the curve never touches the X axis.
