1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So let's go back to the search results we got when we search for Python in union

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and we see the first hit goes to the Python documentation for sets

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and if we follow this we get to that documentation, but the first thing we see is that this is deprecated.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Deprecated means that this is something that the language no longer encourages you to use

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and will be eventually removed from the language, and so that's not what we should use.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We should use the one that it links to, which is the built-in subtype

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and now we see more information about sets.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's see what we get there, so we have a description of the set type

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and what is says is a set object is an unordered collection of hashable objects.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well this also is something that probably doesn't make a lot of sense

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to students who've only taken 101, but let's see if you can figure out on your own what that means.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So here's what it says in the Python documentation.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
A set object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The Python documentation is the definitive reference on Python,

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but it's often not the easiest way to understand something new.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So your goal is to see if you can figure out what this means and if you can,

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
you should be able to answer this quiz correctly.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So your goal is to understand what this means and if you can,

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
you should be able to answer this quiz correctly, which is--which of these objects could be in a set?
