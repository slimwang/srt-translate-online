1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What I'd like to do now is add this to our file that we've been editing.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So we already have an input tag here,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
let's add that name parameter.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's go to our browser now, we'll reload,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
you can see our input box hasn't changed.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We added a name attribute in our HTML,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
but the appearance of the input box doesn't change--

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the name attribute doesn't affect it.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What I'd like you to do is enter some text in this box,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and press enter, and we'll see what happens.
