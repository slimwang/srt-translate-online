Are you excited yet? We hope you are. We

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,140
think you should be. Just look at all of these

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,060
pictures of Google data centers. All the Google services run

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,680
on the infrastructure that you see. And with the Google

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,890
cloud platform and app engine, this infrastructure is also available

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,030
to you. That means that the code you create in

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,300
this course will execute alongside all of the other Google

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,950
services. And can leverage from the same scale security and

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,090
performance that Google has built out over the years. We

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,830
can't wait to get started and have you on your way

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,130
to write and deploy your own code into these data centers

12
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,650
on your journey to writing scalable applications in the Google Cloud.
