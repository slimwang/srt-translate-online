00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,010
The single most important predictor of a successful software design effort

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,230
is the extent to which the development team,

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,760
staff, have experience on similar problems.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,770
Because we all want to participate in successful projects,

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,020
access to that experience is crucial.

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,930
One key source of such experience is familiarity with

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,920
applicable design solutions.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,970
A design pattern is just that.

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,000
A description of a solution to a problem in context.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,520
What this means is that for a given problem, a design pattern provides a way of

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,890
solving it, including a description of the issues and tradeoffs involved.

12
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,130
Situations where the solution applies, options that you as a designer have,

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,458
consequences of using a solution, and any implementation issues.

14
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:46,760
Thus, design patterns are reusable design experience.
