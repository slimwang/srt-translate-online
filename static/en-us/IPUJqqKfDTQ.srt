00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,465
We finished implementing these
steps in our diagram that work with

2
00:00:03,464 --> 00:00:05,476
the Android Intent
system to pick an image.

3
00:00:05,476 --> 00:00:07,656
Let's now code this
portion of the flow chart.

4
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:11,125
That goes to the Firebase Storage and
saves an image to the cloud.

5
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:15,937
To start I'll find the Gradle dependency
for Firebase Storage, copy it.

6
00:00:15,938 --> 00:00:19,817
And in this dependencies block
in my build.gradle file I'll add

7
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:21,780
the dependency.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,839
And of course, sync.

9
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:27,000
With that finished, let's go ahead and
head over to our main activity file.

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,859
As with any Firebase service,

11
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:32,380
you're going to need an instance
to be able to use it.

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,344
I'll create an instance variable
at the top of MainActivity for

13
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:37,134
the Firebase storage component.

14
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:39,074
And I'll initialize it
down here in onCreate.

15
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:41,995
Like with the database
we're also going to have

16
00:00:41,994 --> 00:00:44,004
something called a storage
reference object.

17
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:47,815
I'll make an instance variable for
it up here.

18
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:50,024
And I'll initialize it down here.

19
00:00:50,024 --> 00:00:54,658
This Firebase storage reference has
been initialized to a specific location.

20
00:00:54,658 --> 00:00:58,222
Much in the same way that the message's
database reference was set to

21
00:00:58,222 --> 00:01:00,079
the location messages.

22
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,250
In this case, I'm setting it
to the location chat_photos.

23
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,489
Okay, so now that we have our reference,

24
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,200
let's do something with the photo
result from our image picker.

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,700
To do that, we're going to need to
scroll down to onActivityResult.

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,519
And we'll add another case for
handling the PHOTO_PICKER result.

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,180
When we handle the intent,

28
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,610
the chosen photo will come in
as a Uri from data.getData.

29
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:27,138
So I'll take that Uri and
put it in the variable selectedImageUri.

30
00:01:27,138 --> 00:01:31,411
Okay, now I'm going to make
a reference to the specific photo.

31
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:33,700
Let me explain this line here.

32
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,710
So we're taking our
reference to ChatPhotos, and

33
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:38,599
then we're making a child.

34
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:42,737
Which will be named after the last
part of the path segment for the URI.

35
00:01:42,737 --> 00:01:49,706
So, for example, if we have a URI
like content://local_images/foo/4.

36
00:01:49,706 --> 00:01:54,269
Then the file name that we're saving
our stored image at would be 4.

37
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:56,948
Because it's the last part
of the path segment here.

38
00:01:56,948 --> 00:01:59,558
At this point we've got
a reference location for

39
00:01:59,558 --> 00:02:01,347
the file that we're going to save.

40
00:02:01,347 --> 00:02:04,629
And we've got the URI of that
image that we're going to save.

41
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:08,439
We still need to actually do the saving
of the file to Firebase Storage.

42
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:11,129
But instead of me telling you
exactly what to write in the code

43
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,519
I think you're ready to do it in a quiz.
