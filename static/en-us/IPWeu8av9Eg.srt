1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,085
Well, the other interesting things that we have the teams do,

2
00:00:03,085 --> 00:00:05,809
and the JerseySquare guys was a great example,

3
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:09,009
is to the start to put together the unit economics,

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,024
the metrics that matter for both revenue and cost.

5
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:17,789
So, then we're going to take the annual subscription revenue, $199,

6
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:20,683
and see what their business looks like.

7
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:25,736
So they assumed that the cost of a jersey with 25% off to them,

8
00:00:25,736 --> 00:00:28,543
that is, to JerseySquare was $150.

9
00:00:28,543 --> 00:00:31,903
They think they'll be able to rent it five times during the year

10
00:00:31,903 --> 00:00:35,986
but their shipping cost was about $9, their cleaning cost a dollar

11
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:38,069
processing cost a dollar

12
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:43,993
and their customer acquisition and activation cost $25 a team

13
00:00:43,993 --> 00:00:47,140
and so if you take a look at their unit costs

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,449
you add all this up

15
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:52,285
it's $230 but their revenue was only $199.

16
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:56,452
Why would they do this? 'Cos they were going to lose $31 a year?

17
00:00:56,452 --> 00:00:59,655
Well, remember this was to acquire a customer.

18
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:03,081
But what you need to look at is the customer lifetime value.

19
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:06,420
What happens when this customer renews for the next year?

20
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,120
Well, in the next year, you don't have that jersey cost

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,152
because you're still turning that jersey.

22
00:01:13,152 --> 00:01:16,593
He might have only used it two or three or four times.

23
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:18,988
and you don't have the customer acquisition cost

24
00:01:18,988 --> 00:01:21,389
because you already acquired that customer.

25
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:23,933
You still have your shipping, cleaning and processing costs

26
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:26,584
but your unit costs are now $55

27
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:35,532
and if you get 60% retention, your net for those customers who stay longer than a year is $86.

28
00:01:35,532 --> 00:01:38,048
You can immediately see some of the fallacies

29
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,366
in these first back of the envelope calculations.

30
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:43,156
What if they use the jerseys seven times a year?

31
00:01:43,156 --> 00:01:47,238
You're actually buying more jerseys per year

32
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:49,471
and actually you're losing money in year two, three and four

33
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:52,678
so you might want to be limiting the number of times

34
00:01:52,678 --> 00:01:55,152
you can actually rent a jersey in a year

35
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:57,921
or you could just be changing your revenue model.

36
00:01:57,921 --> 00:02:01,342
But this is a good visual way to start thinking about

37
00:02:01,342 --> 00:02:05,342
how to start doing the math for metrics that matter.
