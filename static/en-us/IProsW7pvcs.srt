1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,430
So let's talk about the role of
the storage in a computer system.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,620
It keeps all the files, the programs,
the data, all the settings,

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,810
the operating system, everything.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,586
And also,

5
00:00:11,586 --> 00:00:16,940
our virtual memory is implemented using
storage because we cannot fit all

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,481
the data that the application actually
wants to access to physical memory.

7
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:26,498
Some of those pages are actually on
disk and when the program accesses them,

8
00:00:26,498 --> 00:00:29,480
they're loaded into the physical memory.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,290
But meanwhile, they're sitting in our
storage, for example, on our disk.

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:41,700
So storage is important, not only
to keep data, but also to extend

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,090
our virtual memory so that we think we
have more memory than we actually have.

12
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,720
For both uses of storage,
we care about performance,

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,690
mainly throughput and latency.

14
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,563
Throughput is how many bytes per
second can we get out of our, for

15
00:00:57,563 --> 00:00:58,652
example, disk.

16
00:00:58,652 --> 00:01:05,110
Latency, once we request a page of data,
when are we going to get it back?

17
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,370
And then storage, this is improving, but

18
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,440
not as quickly as the processor
speed is improving,

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,850
whereas the latency is improving,
but very slowly.

20
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,260
The reduction in storage
latency is even slower

21
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,990
than the reduction in DRAM latency.

22
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,100
So processor are getting faster and
faster.

23
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,540
DRAM is getting faster but
lagging behind processors and

24
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,905
becoming slower and slower,
relative to the processors, and

25
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:40,030
then storage is falling
further behind DRAM itself.

26
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,680
In addition to performance, we are also
really concerned with reliability.

27
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,070
If our processor fails, our system
temporarily doesn't work until we

28
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,000
replace the processor, but then we can
boot up the system and it works again.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,570
But if our disk fails,
we lose our programs, data settings,

30
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:03,090
etc., which is much, much worse
than just a processor failing.

31
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,660
So we are much more worried about
the reliability of our storage

32
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:12,290
than we are about most of the other
elements of our computer system.

33
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,740
And finally, the types of storage
that we can use are very diverse.

34
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,410
We can have magnetic disks,
our traditional hard drives,

35
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:28,680
optical disks such as CDs and
DVDs, tape for backup,

36
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,090
flash drives that are much faster than
most of the other ones, and so on.
