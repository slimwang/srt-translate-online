1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,120
Now we can calculate the sum of squares for between group variability. Remember

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,920
it's the squared deviation of each group mean from the grand mean, then we sum

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,610
all these deviations up and multiply by n, the sample size in each group.
