1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,450
Great.

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,770
Now that you have the context for

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,230
what makes up a LinkedIn profile,
it's time to start building.

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,060
The first step of building is
establishing a strategic mindset.

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,440
You should keep these
three goals in mind.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,400
Goal number one, show up in
search with the right keywords.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,844
Keywords matter because it is one of the
primary ways recruiters find LinkedIn

8
00:00:20,844 --> 00:00:21,527
profiles.

9
00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:24,645
Goal number two, Once your profile
is found, make sure it stands out.

10
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:27,834
There are a lot of profiles in LinkedIn,
so

11
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:32,719
you want yours to not only be
searchable, but also be memorable.

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,125
Goal number three, signal that you
are qualified and motivated for

13
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,390
your desired job.

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,642
You want to make a good
first impression.

15
00:00:40,642 --> 00:00:43,609
Next, try to personalize
these big picture goals so

16
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:47,325
you can understand what to be
included in your LinkedIn profile.

17
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:51,780
To help you with this, conduct
an exercise I like to call the three Rs.

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,270
The three Rs are Reflect,
Research, and Relate.

19
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,900
Now, it's your turn to
get the three Rs a try.
