1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,560
Using the method set persistence
enable should the trick.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,380
You can put in the application class for
shopping list plus plus

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,140
to ensure that it gets called
as soon as the app starts.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,000
You can look at the solution code in the
instructor notes but I just wanted to

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,190
take a second to show you what
the app actually looks like now.

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,433
Before we set persistence
enabled as J.P.

7
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:20,370
showed you, when you navigated
between different screens,

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,680
the listener would be destroyed,
and with it the data.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,700
Now that we have separate
systems enabled,

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,780
let's see what happens going to
go into these two shopping lists.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,040
They're the same shopping list, and

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,270
they're currently sync
up because I'm online.

13
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,640
Now let's go offline with this phone,
and will add an item.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,530
And then we'll kind of
navigate around a bit.

15
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,350
As you can see,
even though I navigated away and back,

16
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,920
and the listener was destroyed,
this item is still here.

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,635
And I can navigate around
the app a little bit more.

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,390
Create another shopping list.

19
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,400
Go take a look at that.

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,210
All this stuff while offline and

21
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,310
then when I go online again
we can see that it syncs up.

22
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,830
Pretty sweet.
