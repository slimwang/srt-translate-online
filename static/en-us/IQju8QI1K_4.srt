1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The highest speed is reached at position B.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We have energy conservation in this system that points B the distance of is the smallest,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
which means that at point B the potential energy is the smallest,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But if the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy remains constant,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
kinetic energy has to be maximum at that point,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which means that the spacecraft has achieved its highest speed at this point.
