This graph over here on the left is the graph of y equals negative x squared.

00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,557
As we learned a few lessons ago, when a problem has a negative leading

3
00:00:07,557 --> 00:00:12,760
coefficient, it points downward. Both of its ends are reaching toward negative

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,811
infinity. This other graph over here is representing y equals x squared, with a

5
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:19,793
positive leading coefficient. Note that these graphs are just flipped versions

6
00:00:19,793 --> 00:00:24,490
of one-another. You get from this one to this one by just taking this graph and

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,259
flipping it across the x axis.
