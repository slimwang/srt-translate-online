1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,156
So here you can see I'm getting
the list of geofences and

2
00:00:03,156 --> 00:00:05,164
I'm going to call it
triggeringGeoFences.

3
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:08,692
And I get this by calling
the getTriggeringGeoFences method on my

4
00:00:08,692 --> 00:00:10,550
geofencing event.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,900
So no matter how many geofences have
been triggered, be it one, be it many,

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,910
they will return to this
list of geofences for me.

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,810
Now the getGeoFenceTransitionDetails
helper function.

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,540
We'll turn all of these into a string.

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,235
So, I just say string,
geofenceTransitionDetails equals

10
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:30,990
getGeofenceTransitionDetails, and
I pass at this,

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,810
I pass at my geofenceTransition, and
I pass at my triggeringGeofences.

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,740
Let's take a look at this function.

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,044
Here's the getGeofenceTransitionDetails.

14
00:00:40,044 --> 00:00:43,563
And you can see it takes the context and
it takes the geofenceTransition,

15
00:00:43,563 --> 00:00:44,882
which was just an integer.

16
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:49,120
And it takes a list of geofences,
which are my triggeringGeofences.

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,120
So first of all I'm going to
get the transition string for

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,270
my actual transition.

19
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,930
And I'm just going to call that
string geofenceTransitionString.

20
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,189
And then I'm going to iterate
through each of my geofences,

21
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:02,330
and get a string out of them.

22
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,230
Load that string into an array list and
then use TextUtils.join on that

23
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,268
array list to join all of those strings
together and to concatenate them.

24
00:01:10,268 --> 00:01:12,719
There are a number of ways
that you could do this, but

25
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,020
ultimately what you're
interested in is this.

26
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,620
The geofence.getRequestId.

27
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,450
This gives you the ID of the geofence
that triggered the event and

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,460
it's up to you how you would
handle that ID, in this case.

29
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,677
Like I said, I'm just concatenating
them all together, so,

30
00:01:27,677 --> 00:01:30,652
if there were a number of
different geofences triggered,

31
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:34,475
I would get their IDs all listed in
this single notification, saying, for

32
00:01:34,475 --> 00:01:36,986
example, Lawrence has
entered Mountain View.

33
00:01:36,986 --> 00:01:39,025
Lawrence has entered entered
the Audacity Studios.

34
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:40,515
Lawrence has entered Studio X.

35
00:01:40,515 --> 00:01:44,335
That type of thing all in a single
notification instead of multiple

36
00:01:44,335 --> 00:01:45,695
notifications.

37
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:49,255
And then, as a result, I just return
my geofenceTransitionString and

38
00:01:49,255 --> 00:01:50,945
the list of IDs that came.

39
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:54,595
So it would be entered plus the list or
exited plus the list.

40
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:55,755
That type of thing.

41
00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:57,815
So this helper function
achieves all of that for you.
