Now to put everything current in this lesson together. Let's

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,010
see how a browser running in your home computer, might establish

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,280
a TCP connection to the Udacity website. And send along

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,930
an HTTP request for the home page. Along the way, I'll

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,840
ask you to help figure out the next step, a

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,060
few times. First the browser needs to find Udacity's IP address.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,116
So it will make a system call. The OS we'll use,

8
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:27,820
well what will it use to convert the host name www.udacity.com

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,630
to an IP Address? Give the three letter acronym here.
