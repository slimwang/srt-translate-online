00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Just to make sure that you're paying attention,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
let's let you work out the value for russian(20, 7).

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Step through the algorithm and count up the number of time that an addition happens.

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Once you've worked it out, type the number into the box here,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and we'll let you know whether or not it's correct.
