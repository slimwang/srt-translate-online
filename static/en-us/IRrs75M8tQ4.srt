00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,025
Let me give you one way to implement
a par.for using only spawn and sync.

2
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:09,149
It's a regular, sequential for
loop that goes from 1 to n.

3
00:00:09,149 --> 00:00:11,454
And each iteration does a spawn.

4
00:00:11,454 --> 00:00:13,484
And finally,
since we need an implicit sync,

5
00:00:13,484 --> 00:00:16,610
I'll stick a sync immediately
after the for loop.

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,550
So for this question,

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,900
again I want you to assume that
the cost of calling foo is a constant.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,180
Then the question is, what's the span?

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,180
Is it constant?

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,270
Log n?

11
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,040
Linear?

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,300
N log n?

13
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:29,800
Choose one.
