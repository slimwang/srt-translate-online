1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,894
So, talking about virtual resources,

2
00:00:01,894 --> 00:00:03,800
there's a lot of talk
about virtualization.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,910
We talked about cloud computing, and
virtualization and things like that.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,500
Once you sort of have these
virtual resources and

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,540
implement them using whatever underlying
physical resources you have, so

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,730
there's no end to what
kinds of things you can do.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,000
We said we had to go through this
translation, and someone, maybe it's,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,360
but that can be done at many levels, so

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,063
I thought we'll talk a little
bit about virtualization, and

10
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:33,150
the context of the security and
protection is our main interest here.

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,010
So we're not talking about
virtualization for the sake of

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,080
virtualization, but how does this
concept actually relate to isolation and

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,410
relate to protection of resources and

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,210
securing them against unauthorized
access and things like that?

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,160
So, main motivation for

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,070
virtualization comes from the fact that
operating system is large and complex.

17
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,740
And the different operating systems,

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,920
different applications may require
different underlying operating systems.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,749
So one use of virtualization
commercially is actually to not be

20
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:06,207
limited to just one operating system and

21
00:01:06,207 --> 00:01:09,430
be able to run multiple
operating systems.

22
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,360
But as I said before we going to look at

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,810
value of this idea when it comes
to protection and security.

24
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,750
So, remember one other thing when
you have a single operating system

25
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,330
supporting all of your applications
is that if the operating system is

26
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,620
compromised, then it's going
to impact all applications.

27
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,250
Every application that you have running
in that system is going to be affected

28
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,150
by this compromise of
the operating system because

29
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,690
they all have this one underlying
common operating system.

30
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,890
Our picture was,

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,880
we have all our apps, then we have our
operating system and the hardware.

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,245
If something goes wrong here,
of course, all of this is affected.
