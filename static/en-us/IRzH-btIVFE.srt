1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,562
Get more comfortable with
the LLDB command line.

2
00:00:03,562 --> 00:00:06,138
You're going to have to dive
right into the documentation and

3
00:00:06,138 --> 00:00:08,000
just start playing with things yourself.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,430
In the instructions notes I've
linked to the LLDB documentation.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,830
And I want you to use it to answer
the following questions for the so

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,180
many bugs app.

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,168
So what we want to know is, what LLDB
command will set a break point on

8
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:25,200
line 26 of the BugFactory.swift file?

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,910
We want to know what command
will set a breakpoint on

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,310
all Swift methods whose
selector is viewDidLoad.

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,610
And if you don't know what a selector
is, a selector is another word for the.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,205
So viewDidLoad, that'll correspond
to say the viewDidLoad and

13
00:00:40,205 --> 00:00:44,085
UI view controller, the base class,
but it'll also refer to

14
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:47,965
the viewDidLoad that we've implemented
in the break point bug view controller,

15
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,665
or any sub classes of
UI view controller.

16
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,800
Next, what command will list all the
breakpoints that are currently set for

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,970
application, and what command will
show the stack trace for all threads?

18
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,912
So I want you to
experiment in X code and

19
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:06,210
write your answers in the boxes
next to each of these questions.

20
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,215
Note, for all of my answers I'm using
the non abbreviated commands and

21
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:14,570
their options, so your answers may not
exactly match mine and that's okay.

22
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,790
The most important thing here is
that we get the same outcomes, and

23
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,370
you get practice using the command
line and the documentation for it.

24
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,110
So go ahead and attempt the problems and

25
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,100
then check to see if your answers
behave the same way as mine.
