1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,019
So now you've seen that you can encode four things

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,770
in bits. You can encode any number, we just need more

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,560
bits. So if we have more bits, we can encode

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,500
more different things. So, here I've got four bits. That means

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,988
I have four yes, no choices. And I can encode

6
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:19,680
sixteen different numbers. And the reason for that is because 2

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,800
to the 4 is 16. Every time I add one

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,450
more bit, I double the number of things. Because I have

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,970
one more yes, no question. So for just this part

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,840
of the graph, I had eight things, I had three bits.

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,120
I could distinguish between the numbers zero through seven. Adding one

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,720
more bit, doubles the number of things I can distinguish. So

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,800
that's a way to measure information. And once we can distinguish

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,250
any number of things. Well, we can send any kind of

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,680
data we want. Anything that's discreet, we can turn into a

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,540
number. So we could turn letters into numbers. If we have

17
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,322
a long string, we could have a sequence of numbers, which

18
00:00:53,322 --> 00:00:56,710
we can turn into one really big number. So, once we can

19
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,820
send bits, we can send anything we want. So that's what

20
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,580
bandwidth is. It's a measure of the amount of information that we

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,820
can send, and we're measuring the number of bits. Each bit

22
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,000
is one yes or no decision. In computing, we usually think of

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,810
that as either a 0 or 1. So that long stream of

24
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,670
0's and 1's is the information we're sending. And it could be

25
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,463
encoding a string of text like a dozen of web

26
00:01:18,463 --> 00:01:21,211
page. It could be encoding an image, it could be

27
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:24,310
encoding a number. And to measure our bandwidth, we need

28
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,600
to know how many bits can we send per second.
