00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The next question I’d like to ask you about a different scatter plot--

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
this one relating to web analytics.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We’re comparing two measurements that are fairly commonly used.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
One is Click Through Rate which represents the fraction of people who visit a page

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that go on to do something--typically clicking an ad, clicking through to a course of Udacity,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
clicking through an article of a new site, etc.,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and the time it takes to load a web page--the page load time.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now, let’s looks some simulated data.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When looking at this data, I'd like you to answer a few questions.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
First, do you believe these pieces of data are related?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That is for different page load times, is the Click Through Rate different?

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And then similar to what you’ve been asked before, I’d like you to tell me if the relationship

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
between these things is linear--if in fact there is a relationship.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And then I'd like you to also tell me whether the relationship is exact.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And then I’d also like you to tell me two more things.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Is the relationship between these positive or negative?

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Just recall what a positive and negative relationship are a couple of simplified examples.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A perfectly positive linear relationship would look something like this,

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
but this and this are also positive relationships, whereas a negative linear relationship

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
would look like this, but this and this are also negative relationships.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Take a look at this data and check all that apply.
