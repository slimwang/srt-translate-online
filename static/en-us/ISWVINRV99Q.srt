00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,333
>> So finally, how can we factor x squared minus 8x plus 15? Think about the

2
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:08,673
values that you just got for a and b, and how they fit in the form of binomials

3
00:00:08,673 --> 00:00:13,616
that are multiplied together to give quadratic expressions. This is a little bit

4
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:16,805
tricky. So just give it a couple tries if you need to.
