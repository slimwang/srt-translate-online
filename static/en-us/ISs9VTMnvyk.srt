00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,150
Let's assume that you want to send a message from

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,000
Atlanta to San Francisco. And to make it easier, let's

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,390
assume that we want to send a simple message which

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,380
consists of n coin flips, or the output of ten coin

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,370
flips. Let us construct two messages out of coin flips.

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,770
Now, I have two coins, but you see these coins

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,550
are different because this one has a heads and a

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,280
tails, it has two different sides, And this one has both

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,450
the sides which are very similar looking. So its a

10
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,170
biased coin so every time I flip its going have

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,540
the same state. While when I flip this it might

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,278
either end up here, 50% of the time or end

13
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:42,050
up here 50% of the time. So we'll construct two

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,860
messages after flipping both of them and recording what their

15
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,100
state is. So here it is, I did ten coin

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,450
flips with the fair coin I got a few heads,

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,030
a few tails, in this particular sequence. The unfair

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,800
coin, I'm calling every state as a head state and

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,890
I basically saw ten heads. All right? If you

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,110
also observe the fair coin I have like five heads

21
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:09,620
and five tails. So the probability, so it, so it wa, so it is a fair coin. I got

22
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,470
five heads and five tails, so it is a

23
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,990
fair coin. So, if I had to transmit this sequence,

24
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,610
how many bits of message will I require? Let's

25
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,270
assume that I can represent this sequence using ten

26
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,390
binary digits. A zero representing heads, one representing tails

27
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,760
and I can write down this sequence as zeros

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,130
and ones using ten bits. I can also write

29
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,430
down the same sequence with the, of the unfair

30
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,140
coin using those ten binary digits. So I'll get

31
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,874
something like zero, one, zero, zero, one, zero, one.

32
00:01:40,874 --> 00:01:44,650
And here, everything will be zeros. Let's assume I have to transmit

33
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:49,410
these two particular sequences from Atlanta to San Francisco. What will be

34
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,060
the size of each message in case of the fair coin and

35
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,020
the unfair coin? What do you think? Write down your answers here.
