00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,719
So today, we've talked about explanation-based learning,

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,420
a type of learning where we learn new connections between existing concepts.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,965
We first talked about our concept space.

4
00:00:07,965 --> 00:00:10,028
A space of information that enables us to draw inferences and

5
00:00:10,028 --> 00:00:14,924
connections about existing concepts. We then talked about how prior knowledge is

6
00:00:14,924 --> 00:00:18,712
mapped onto this concept space for new reasoning. Then we talked about how we

7
00:00:18,712 --> 00:00:22,700
may abstract over prior knowledge to discern transferable nuggets. And how we

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,770
might then transfer those nuggets onto the new problem we encounter. Next time,

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,670
we'll expand on this idea of transfer to talk about analogical reasoning,

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,360
which is inherently transfer-based. Explanation-based learning will also come up

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,510
significantly in learning about correcting mistakes and

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,180
in diagnosis. So feel free to jump ahead into those lessons,

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,790
if you're interested in continuing with this example.
