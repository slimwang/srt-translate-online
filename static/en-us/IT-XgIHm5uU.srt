1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,130
So James, do you think we should go over the differences between

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,300
bracket notation, dot notation and object literal notation?

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:07,870
>> Not really.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,130
I think that conversation would make this class a lot longer.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,690
Let's put a link in the instructor's notes to give students more information.

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,100
Good news is, they're pretty similar.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,930
>> Yeah. That's fair.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,860
Okay. So we're about to get into control flow in JavaScript.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,910
But, before we do, let's go ahead and finish all of our objects.

10
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,440
The work object and projects objects needed to be created.

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,980
And let's go ahead and finish up the biography and education objects.

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,750
While we're at it, let's go ahead and

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,790
clean out resumeBuilder.js too, so that way, it only contains the four objects.

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,380
You might have some code in resumeBuilder.js from previous quizzes.

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,670
If you want to keep it, that's totally cool.

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,250
But you should comment it out with two slashes.

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,160
These two slashes at

18
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,510
the beginning of any line will comment out the rest of the line.

19
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,010
Or, if you don't want to comment out your code, you can just simply cut and

20
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,350
paste all of it into a different file.

21
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,650
>> That's a good idea.

22
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,530
Let's start the next lesson with a clean file,

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,940
with just our biographical objects.

24
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,840
Click this box once you've created your bio, work, projects and

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,380
education objects, and

26
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,330
either have cleared out or commented out, all of your previous code.
