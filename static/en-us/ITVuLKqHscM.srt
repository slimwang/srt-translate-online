00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's wrap up what we've learned in this unit.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Strings are just sequences of characters,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and manipulating strings is going to be critically important for making a web browser.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Modern programming languages support regular expressions,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
which are just a concise notation for specifying sets of strings,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and using regular expressions is more flexible

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
than using fixed string matching like string.find.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
With regular expressions, we can define phone numbers,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
words, numbers, quoted strings,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and given a regular expression, we can search for and match it in a bigger string.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Finite state machines are a pictorial equivalent to regular expressions.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Every regular expression, concatenation, plus, question mark, star,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
has an equivalent finite state machine.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And in fact, although I didn't show it, vice versa.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Every regular expression has a finite state machine,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and every finite state machine has a regular expression.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And then every finite state machine can be converted

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to a deterministic finite state machine.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
No epsilons, no ambiguity.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Once we have a deterministic finite state machine,

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
we can simulate it, and it turns out it's very easy--

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
about 10 lines of recursive code--to see if a deterministic

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
finite state machine accepts a string.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
In fact, you've written that code.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now that you know how to implement regular expressions,

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
take the regular expression, make a finite state machine,

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
make it deterministic, call FSM sim.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We'll just use Python's regular expression library,

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
but it's doing exactly those steps under the hood.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It works the same way you would.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In our next exciting episode, we're going to use this knowledge

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
to specify important parts of HTML and JavaScript

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
like string constants or hypertext tags.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
As the first step to writing our web browser,

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
one great resource available to you as you revise this material

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and work on the homework is the forums.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Be sure to check them out.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you were wondering about something, almost certainly someone else

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
was wondering as well.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Post your question. Others will benefit from seeing it answered.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Be courteous, but be curious.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We all benefit from questions.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And let me just leave you with this xkcd comic.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
While they're talking about Pearl, everything said applies to Python,

45
00:02:05,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and soon you will be using regular expressions to save the world.
