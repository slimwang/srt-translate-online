00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
So, I'll start out with a very simple graph here.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,300
Let's say in this graph you wanted to get from A to B.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,640
I've purposefully not added any distances to the edges here,

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,620
because we will just assume that the length of each edge is 1.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,770
Now, if you wanted to get from A to B,

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:21,030
what would be the length of the shortest path from A to B

7
00:00:21,030 --> 99:59:59,999
that visits all vertices. Please enter your answer here.
