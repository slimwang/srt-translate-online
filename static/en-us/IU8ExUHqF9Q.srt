1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now let's get back to the general complexity classes.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So we have already drawn this picture here--the hierarchy of P versus NP,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
versus EXPTIME, versus NEXPTIME.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,500
And, of course, there are other complexity classes

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,000
that we have gotten to know in this course.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So there's the class of fixed-parameter tractable problems.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Then we looked at problems for which there are or are not approximation algorithms.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So we had problems for which there was a PTAS,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,500
we had some problems for which there was a constant factor approximation,

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
and we also mentioned that there are problems such as clique

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,000
and independent set for which there's no constant factor approximation

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
unless P=NP.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And then, finally, we looked at randomized algorithms where we said there were

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Monte Carlo algorithms--those were the problems that were guaranteed to run

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
in polynomial time but only with a certain probability give us a correct solution.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,800
And then we also mentioned Las Vegas algorithms which are algorithms that

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,000
guarantee us a correct solution, but the running time is only polynomial

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
with a certain given probability.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Of course, we can also start building hierarchies here,

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
so we can do a hierarchy for approximation,

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and we can do a hierarchy for randomized algorithms.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And guess what--this is going to be our next quiz.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So as in the quiz before, when we talked about P, NP, EXPTIME, and NEXPTIME,

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm, again, giving numbers to these complexity classes here, and, again,

25
00:01:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I would like you to enter the numbers here so that we form a nice hierarchy.
