1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,246
>> So one thing I've heard about 3 d printing or catchphrase is complexity is

2
00:00:04,246 --> 00:00:07,222
free. I don't know if you want to say anything about that. [laugh] I think

3
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:11,110
that's an interesting one. It's what, what does that mean to you? >> So that to

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:16,926
me means you can get as complex as you want with an object. And you can go as

5
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:21,184
crazy as you want. I've seen people do stools that were replicated sea foam.

6
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:24,530
Because they could 3D print them, and there's no other way you could ever

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,324
manufacturer that, now you can. And, I think really what that means also is,

8
00:00:28,324 --> 00:00:32,420
complexity is something that we can tend to put into something, and we tend to

9
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,660
make things over complicated, because now that we can. And, now's kind of the

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,176
time where the wave hits the end. Right? And you have to look back and say

11
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:44,080
again, you know, what's the best way to make this and how do you make something

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,679
that could be really complex, very simplistic, because now we have the

13
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,845
technology to do it and the design software is so easy. >> Right, right. I mean

14
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:55,237
I've heard of experiments where they'll like evolve designs and they'll say

15
00:00:55,237 --> 00:00:58,523
well, now that we can build it in any shape we want, let's just start putting

16
00:00:58,523 --> 00:01:01,536
out different designs and have it computer analyzed. >> Yeah. >> And see which

17
00:01:01,536 --> 00:01:04,504
the best one is. >> Yeah. >> So that sounds really interesting. >> With 3D

18
00:01:04,504 --> 00:01:08,637
printing, I mean, the future could be very, very Baroque. [laugh] ... >> [laugh]

19
00:01:08,638 --> 00:01:11,324
>> You could have your face on every single object in your house if you wanted

20
00:01:11,324 --> 00:01:14,440
to, ... >> [laugh] >> But that's one of those questions that keep coming up, is.

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,686
Yeah. [laugh] is how do you scale that back and say, well do I really need my

22
00:01:18,686 --> 00:01:21,887
face on that door knob? Is that the best door knob there is? [laugh] You know,

23
00:01:21,887 --> 00:01:24,303
to be able to grab my head. It's probably not.
