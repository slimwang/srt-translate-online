1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,025
Now that we've learned
a bit about audio,

2
00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:03,960
why don't we spice things up a bit?

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's use a bunch of sounds
in a scene, rather than just the one.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,780
&gt;&gt; Well we could do that, but
it might sound very discoherent.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,210
&gt;&gt; No, we're not going to
play them all at once.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,075
We can organize it, and
then pick out sounds to play so

7
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:19,993
that it gives it a lot more variety.

8
00:00:19,993 --> 00:00:22,610
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we could create
a collection of our sound clips and

9
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,365
then just pick a random one from that.

10
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:26,030
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you mean using an array.

11
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,280
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so an array is basically a
collection of variables that we can then

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,960
put into this list and
reference them by a specific number.

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,450
&gt;&gt; Right, first you say,
how big is the array?

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,591
Then you put your stuff in it, and
then you can access any one of them with

15
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:43,715
an integer, right,
like sound three or sound five.

16
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:46,102
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so why don't we do that?

17
00:00:46,102 --> 00:00:47,816
Let's build up our array and

18
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:52,090
then pick a random value that will
act as the sound clip we play.

19
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,020
&gt;&gt; Sounds fun, let's do it.
