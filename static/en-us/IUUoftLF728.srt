00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,270
Last lesson we briefly went over some of
the platforms you can use to accelerate

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,740
your VR development.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,880
And trust me when I say they make
creating VR content so much easier.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,352
In this lesson,
we'll be diving into the Unity editor,

5
00:00:14,352 --> 00:00:18,199
we'll go over how to get it installed,
how to navigate around.

6
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:21,625
And then at the end, we'll use
Unity to customize a project and

7
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,040
put it on your smart phone.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,735
So get excited,

9
00:00:24,735 --> 00:00:28,420
because you're on your way to
building some amazing VR experiences.
