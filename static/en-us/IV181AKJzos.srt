1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,416
The last value printed by this loop is 2,000. This is a little bit weird,

2
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:07,392
because the loop's condition says that it only runs as long as n is less than

3
00:00:07,392 --> 00:00:11,970
1,000. Let's hand trace this code to see how this happened. I'll track the

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,434
values of n, and what gets output. I start by setting n to two. And then I

5
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:22,505
check, n is less than 1,000, which is true. Two is less than 1,000. So I set n

6
00:00:22,505 --> 00:00:28,122
to be 10 times 2. And then I print out n. So I print out 20. Now, I'm at the

7
00:00:28,122 --> 00:00:31,041
end of the curly braces. So I go back up to the top of the loop and check the

8
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:37,339
condition again. N is 20 now, which is still less than 1000. So I'm going to

9
00:00:37,339 --> 00:00:44,041
repeat the steps inside the loop again. I'l set n to 10 times 20. So I get 200.

10
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,950
And then I print out 200. I get to the curly brace, so I go back up to the top

11
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:56,476
of the loop again. 200 is less than 1,000, so we'll repeat the loop again. I'll

12
00:00:56,476 --> 00:01:01,302
set n to 10 times 200 over 2,000, and then print 2,000. And now I'm at the

13
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:05,720
bottom of the loop, so I come back up and check the ignition. 2000 is less 1000

14
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,585
is no longer true. So I'm going to skip to the bottom and be done. It looks

15
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:15,314
like the last thing that was printed was 2000. And we managed to print a larger

16
00:01:15,314 --> 00:01:19,149
value of n than 1000 because the print statement comes after we update the loop

17
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:24,779
variable. It matters when we update the n inside the body of the loop.
