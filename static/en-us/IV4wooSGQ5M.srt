1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The primary function of P is to minimize the error. We steer in proportion to the error.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The D term avoids the overshoot, if used wisely.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Systematic drift and biases are best addressed by the I term.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the correct answer, which I'm sure you got right at this point.
