1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,117
Okay.
So, one more question which has to deal

2
00:00:03,117 --> 00:00:07,853
with one of the requirements we have for
a trusted computing base.

3
00:00:07,853 --> 00:00:10,069
We know that's complete mediation,

4
00:00:10,069 --> 00:00:13,880
which means untrusted code cannot
bypass the operating system or

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,466
the the trusted computing base when they
need access to a protected resource.

6
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:21,441
We're going to say that
you can't bypass it.

7
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:23,600
And so, you'll have to come
to the operating system.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,130
And then, the operating system has to
figure out who is making the request.

9
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,940
How does the operating system know that?
