00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,364
Now, comes a better question. Can we graph this parabola? Well, the equation

2
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:09,731
isn't in vertex form. So, we'll need to do something different. We know the

3
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:14,998
vertex form has a perfect square in it. So, what if we completed the square for

4
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:20,201
the x terms, so that way we could get a perfect square? Essentially, we want to

5
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:25,475
change this equation, so it looks like this vertex form. I can group these x

6
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:30,550
terms together, and then we can add an amount in order to complete the square.

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,385
But, since we don't want to complete the square unless the coefficient of this

8
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:39,890
x squared term is positive one, let's factor out two from both of these terms.

9
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,030
Now, I haven't completed the square yet but I did factor out a two here and

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:50,562
here. This left me with two times the quantity x squared minus 8x plus 33 on

11
00:00:50,562 --> 00:00:56,252
the end. I'm just leaving a spot here in order to complete the square soon. If

12
00:00:56,252 --> 00:01:00,410
we were to complete the square here, what number would we put here in order to

13
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:05,820
have a perfect square? Type that number in right here.
