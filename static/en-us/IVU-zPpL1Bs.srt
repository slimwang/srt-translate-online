1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,594
So, let me give you examples for two

2
00:00:02,596 --> 00:00:05,382
consecutive prices. So, here’s one example

3
00:00:05,382 --> 00:00:10,595
where the stock changed from 286.85, 286.83.

4
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:14,460
First you calculate the Delta T, which to

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,649
remind you was the difference of those two

6
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:24,421
things, Xt+1 - Xt, normalized by Xt. So, why

7
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:26,151
don’t you give me your calculation of Delta T,

8
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,000
into this box over here.
