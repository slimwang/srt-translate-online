1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,844
Since we're looking for roots, once again we set y equal to zero. Which is just

2
00:00:03,844 --> 00:00:07,621
going to leave a 10, on the left side of the equation, and change nothing about

3
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:11,433
the right side. Now we need to move toward getting x by itself. You can notice

4
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:15,118
that I actually didn't use the quadratic formula, in solving this equation.

5
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:19,588
Instead, I just undid all the operations that had been performed on x on the

6
00:00:19,588 --> 00:00:24,184
right side of the equation. Eventually this led me to the answer of x equals 3

7
00:00:24,184 --> 00:00:28,714
plus or minus i times the square root of 5. Now one thing to note about the way

8
00:00:28,714 --> 00:00:33,420
that I've written this answer. You'll see that I wrote i in front of the radical

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,596
sign, whereas we'd normally write in the form a plus bi, where the real

10
00:00:37,596 --> 00:00:42,537
coefficient of the imaginary portion comes in front of the number i. However, to

11
00:00:42,537 --> 00:00:47,217
avoid confusion as to whether or not the i belongs under the radical sign, it's

12
00:00:47,217 --> 00:00:51,988
often written in front of the square root sign instead. This is similar to if we

13
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:56,502
had something like 3 times the root of five, writing the number this way is

14
00:00:56,502 --> 00:01:01,282
usually the convention. Rather than this way, just to make perfectly clear what

15
00:01:01,282 --> 00:01:05,396
doesn't belong under the radical sign. Either way though, with the i as the

16
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:09,488
first factor, or the i coming after the square root of 5, is mathematically

17
00:01:09,488 --> 00:01:10,085
correct.
