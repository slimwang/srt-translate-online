1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,680
Alright, Michael. So, you got it? Which line do you think is best?

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,576
>> Alright, so if I choose one green and one red [CROSSTALK]

3
00:00:07,576 --> 00:00:09,880
that means there's nine different possible

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,320
lines. But they all separate the points.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:13,740
>> That is correct.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,940
>> I'm pretty sure. I, you know, I think they're intended to

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,010
even if they don't quite. But I think they do, I think they

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,590
actually all separate the positives from

9
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,070
the negatives [CROSSTALK]. The positives on

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,440
the upper right side and the negatives on the lower left side. So,

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,450
I mean the only one that seems further special

12
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,650
is the middle one. If I choose the middle green

13
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,860
and the middle red it's kind of, you know, ecstatically

14
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,570
pleasing, there's a lot of space on, on each side.

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,130
>> Okay.

16
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,700
>> So, I'm going to go with that but it's not clear, you

17
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,310
know again, best if I was a photographer that might be the best.

18
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,680
>> Hm, you are a photographer. So, let's pretend I can draw

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,830
a straight lines. That's pretty good. That's the line that you've chosen.

20
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:51,710
>> Yes.

21
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,880
>> And you think that's best. Well, I'm going to give you a

22
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,560
hint, Michael, and tell you that you were correct. That's a pretty good hint.

23
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,390
>> Yeah.

24
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,510
>> But now I want you to figure out

25
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,090
for me why that line is better than this line.

26
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,880
>> Interesting. Alright, well so one thing that's, that

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,710
second line. The. Orange line, as oppose to the orange

28
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,210
line, has against it, in some sense it seems

29
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,290
to get really, really close to that bottom minus point.

30
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,890
Maybe it's a little too close. Like maybe that

31
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,950
minus is near other minuses that we just can't see.

32
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,540
And since we drew really really close, a line really

33
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,400
really close to it, it could be we ended chopping

34
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,190
of some of the minuses that. That we might

35
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,990
want to have kept on the other side. And so

36
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,880
maybe by drawing it in the middle it's sort of,

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,230
we have the biggest, I don't know like demilitarized zone.

38
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:42,340
>> No, I like that. So that is a very good explanation

39
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,210
for why you would prefer the middle line over the.

40
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,350
Other line that isn't the middle line. And you can make

41
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,350
a similar argument for any other of the nine lines that,

42
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,330
that or the other eight lines that you could possibly draw.

43
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,350
Let me draw another line for you and you tell

44
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,110
me if you think this one is good or bad and

45
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,240
why it might be better or worse than the middle one.

46
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,500
See if you give me a different answer. I can take

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,830
one of the parallel lines which again we will pretend is a straight line and

48
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,070
put it there. Or I can take in fact the other line that is meant to be parallel

49
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,670
to it and why aren't those lines better? Or just as good.

50
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,950
>> I guess I'd use the same explanation as before

51
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,470
which is that these, the, the line that was, is really

52
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,710
close to the pluses maybe is a little too close

53
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,230
for comfort and it, it gets very close to that plus.

54
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,210
The, kind of, I don't know. I could point to it, but maybe

55
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,490
you should point to it. The plus that's really close to the line.

56
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,090
>> I'm pointing to it.

57
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,980
>> Because Again if there's a just, you

58
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,860
know, other data points near there, it's going

59
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,170
to make this distinction between the positives and

60
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,370
the negatives that isn't really warranted by the data.

61
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,820
>> Right, so I could make the op the

62
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,170
opposite argument with you, Michael, which is that listen, they

63
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,330
all separate the points. They completely explain the data

64
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,292
as we see them. So, all three of those lines

65
00:02:58,292 --> 00:03:00,430
explain the data. In fact, all nine of those lines explain

66
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,530
the data. So, why aren't they warranted by the data. What's the

67
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,100
problem that you might run into if you put one line very

68
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,610
close to the positives or one line very close to the minuses?

69
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,080
>> Well, again...so, so...it may be that they fit

70
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,690
this data. But, this is just a sample from the

71
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,630
population. And so... You know, we don't know what's

72
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,220
going to happen really close to that other plus is.

73
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,120
So like in the nearest neighbor algorithm for

74
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,290
example which you always try to make me remember,

75
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,370
it's going to want to, you know, if it's

76
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,120
closer to the pluses, it should be a plus.

77
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,150
>> Right. That makes sense and I think that's exactly right so your

78
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,660
intuition and I think the intuition that people should take with them is that

79
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,300
lines that are too close to the positives. Or lines that are too close

80
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,970
to the negatives, sort of have this

81
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,290
feature where you're believing the training data

82
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,560
that you've got too much. You've decided that all of these

83
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,530
boundaries are fine because of the specific set of training data

84
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,460
that we've got. And while you want to believe the data, because

85
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,830
that's all you've got, you don't want to believe the data too much.

86
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,550
>> That's overfitting.

87
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,030
>> That's overfitting. So, the problem with those two

88
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,660
lines, or one way to think about the problem with

89
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,510
those two lines, is that these lines are more likely

90
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,530
to overfit. And why is that? It's because they're believing

91
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,730
the data too much. So, given that we're trying to avoid

92
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,410
overfitting, what could you say about the middle line? So, here's

93
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,769
the argument that I would make, and you tell me if

94
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,270
you buy it, Michael. This line, or the line it's intended to

95
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,950
represent anyway, is the line that is consistent with the data

96
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,190
while committing least to it. That seems like a good way

97
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,180
of saying what I was feeling, yeah. It is funny though

98
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,590
because like, overfitting up to this point, we you, we were generally

99
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,880
talking about overfitting as being something where there's

100
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,440
a great deal of model complexity in some sense.

101
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:43,855
>> Mm-hm.

102
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:45,590
>> And it doesn't seem like those lines that are

103
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,220
closer to the pluses or closer to the minuses. Are

104
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,330
inherently more complex, they're still lines. It's interesting that they,

105
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,020
they, they kind of maybe behave as if they are.

106
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,320
>> Right, and in fact they, they're,

107
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,240
it's a more, sort of, literal interpretation

108
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,440
of the words over and fit, right? You, you have decided to fit the data,

109
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,210
and you believe it too much, and what you really want to

110
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,880
do is commit. The least that you can commit to the

111
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,490
data while still being consistent with it right. So this basic

112
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,180
idea of, uh, uh, finding the line of least commitment in the

113
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,750
linear separable set of data, is the basis behind support vector

114
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,040
machines. So what I want to do next is I want to

115
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,020
see if we can come up with some equation that would

116
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,600
help us define such a line. It's easy in this case

117
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,980
cause we're staring at it but if you imagine these points were in

118
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,510
700 and thirteen thousand dimensions it would pretty difficult to find such a

119
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,830
plane just by staring at it so let's see if we can try

120
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,260
to work out how you go about finding this least commitment line okay

121
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:42,490
>> Cool.
