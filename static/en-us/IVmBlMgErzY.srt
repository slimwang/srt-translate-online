1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,830
So now that we have completed our update function which takes a year,

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,650
filters our data, updates our data bind, removes and

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:14,410
circles that the previous updated data bind would cause to be irrelevant,

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,510
access through the exit selection, add any new circles that need to be on

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,600
the page based on what happened in the updated data bind by

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,430
simply taking the enter selection and appending circles.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,340
And then effectively filtering the countries we show by changing the styling,

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,780
such that only the countries that had a team in the World Cup are shown.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,660
So just to recap where we are, we completed the first task that we needed to

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,200
get done before we could animate our map by writing an update function

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,650
that takes a single year and manipulates the elements on our map.

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,780
To properly represent the given year and the attendance in that year.

13
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,960
Remember, the second part of animating our map,

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,220
was to simply cycle over all the years of the World Cup.

15
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:06,260
There are many ways to perform the type of animation that we want to do in d3,

16
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,620
but for simplicity's sake, I'm going to use one of the most explicit,

17
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,170
even though there's more efficient and robust ways to do this.

18
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,620
I've linked to a few examples in the instructor notes with some

19
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:22,200
resources an tutorials that cover other ways to create animations in D3
