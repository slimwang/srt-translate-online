1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,070
Now remember, our generic data types for

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,280
AsyncTasks are params,
progress, and result.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,525
These data types are handled by the
doInBackground, onProgressUpdate, and

4
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:14,420
onPostExecute methods, respectively.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,390
We can replace the first generic
type with a string object.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,830
According to the AsyncTask reference,
DoInBbackground is the method that

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,090
handles the first generic data type,
which is params.

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,120
And when we look at
the DoInBackground method,

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,150
you can see here that it takes
string as the input type.

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,620
So, string would be the correct answer.

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,280
The second param uses
the onProgressUpdate method.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,880
As I look at this code, I can see there
is absolutely no sign of on progress

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,630
update method anywhere to be seen.

14
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,230
So what does this tell me?

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,370
That's right,
we aren't using progress updates here.

16
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,810
In the spec, it's said to use Void
if we aren't using a data type so

17
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,510
that's exactly the right answer here.

18
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,160
Note that Void here is capitalize
because it's an object data type.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,280
The third param is handled
by onPostExecute, and

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,520
here the code uses a string,
so string is the right answer.

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,790
Awesome work.

22
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,360
So to sum up how to use the Async Task,

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,110
you need to first create
a subclass of Async Task.

24
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:22,035
You can call it something Something like
DownloadWebpageTask, or SortDataTask, or

25
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:25,655
SaveVideoTask, or
whatever makes sense for your app.

26
00:01:25,655 --> 00:01:29,825
Use doInBackground to perform whatever
task you need to do in the background

27
00:01:29,825 --> 00:01:33,585
that's going to take some time, such
as making a call to another web server,

28
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:35,740
or running a filter on a photo.

29
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,140
Use onProgressUpdate to provide
status updates to your app.

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,680
And lastly use onPostExecute to get
the results of your background task.
