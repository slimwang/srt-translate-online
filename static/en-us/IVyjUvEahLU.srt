If I wanted to type x is less than or equal to 3, I would type in on my keyboard

2
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:11,761
x, a backslash symbol, the letters l, e, and then a space. Right after you hit

3
00:00:11,773 --> 00:00:17,199
the space, the backslash and the le will transform into a less than or equal to

4
00:00:17,211 --> 00:00:21,555
sign and that's also what this letter stand for, less than or equal to. If you

5
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:26,022
don't type in a space after these characters, then nothing will happen. Once you

6
00:00:26,034 --> 00:00:30,117
have entered a space you can continue typing. I would just set 3 to get x is

7
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:34,002
less than or equal to 3. I have greater than or equal to symbol works in a

8
00:00:34,014 --> 00:00:38,630
similar way. You would type backslash then ge, and the space. You're going to

9
00:00:38,642 --> 00:00:42,715
have a chance to practice that here and here, just by typing in what I have

10
00:00:42,727 --> 00:00:46,825
written here. And then as a challenge to you, you'll be able to try these 2

11
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:51,115
inequalities. Notice that they contain an infinity symbol. For the infinity

12
00:00:51,127 --> 00:00:55,261
symbol, you simply need to type in a backslash and then the letters inf and a

13
00:00:55,273 --> 00:00:59,735
space. The space again will transofrm these characters into your infinity

14
00:00:59,747 --> 00:01:04,190
symbol. For this infinity, it's negative. So, I put a negative sign in front

15
00:01:04,202 --> 00:01:08,645
first. This is just the minus sign or the dash on your keyboard. Try playing

16
00:01:08,657 --> 00:01:13,180
around with your keyboard and see if you can get these same math expressions

17
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,175
using MathQuill. It's pretty cool.
