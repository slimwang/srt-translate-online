00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Now how about this little bit more complicated graph?

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,900
Again, I would like you to figure out the number of paths or the number of different ways

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,370
that you can take to get from A to B and the rules here are again the same--

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,970
you can only travel in this forward direction.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm again going to draw the little arrows. So please enter your answer here into this box.
