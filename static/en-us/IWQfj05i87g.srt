1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,719
So here let me make simple observations about how we can actually do

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:04,430
this kind of stuff.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,420
Again, notice in this case, looking at it carefully,

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,760
there is two dominant directions, one in the, one up and

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,220
down, and the other one this way on this image.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,890
We can look at it and actually create a two dimensional axes here.

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,500
And now we want to actually start looking at what we

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,240
can actually extract out of.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,700
Now recall, when we talked about Fourier transforms we said that when,

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,220
in a Fourier transform, for every frequency omega that goes from zero to

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,440
infinity, the Fourier transform holds the amplitude A and

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,390
the phase phi, of the sine function.

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,590
That's best represented, and we looked at this before, by this equation.

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,630
Amplitude A, sine omega t plus phi.

15
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,370
So now we're interested in, of course, representing this.

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,840
So we can actually extract information in axes like this.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,780
The two dimensional axes of an image.

18
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,510
Basically what we do is, we can use the real and

19
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,330
complex numbers to achieve this.

20
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:04,120
So we'll represent F omega as a real part and an imaginary part here.

21
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,550
Imaginary part and the real part.

22
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:13,170
So now if I can start representing my Fourier transform in this way,

23
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,760
which basically means now it's a vector in an imaginary and

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,210
a real space, we can start doing things like simple vector calculus or

25
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,870
vector arithmetic to able to compute things like the magnitude and the angle.

26
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,990
So the magnitude of the amplitude, basically, is nothing else but the square and

27
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,360
the real part plus the square of the imaginative part over in a square root and

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,670
that gives me the magnitude, which would be the A here and v would basically be

29
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:44,730
the arctangent, or tangent inverse of the imaginary over the real number.

30
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,800
So that, in essence, starts giving us information,

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,520
like we can start computing things, like this axis and

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,630
the angle, and it can also compute, of course, the magnitude of this vector.

33
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,450
Using these types of things, and again, depending on what kind of signal you're

34
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,420
looking at, and what variables you're looking at,

35
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,260
we can start computing these kinds of things for an image like this.
