00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,377
Here are three more sets of equations. We know these equations really represent

2
00:00:04,377 --> 00:00:08,771
lines, so tell me, is each pair perpendicular, parallel, or neither? Put the

3
00:00:08,771 --> 00:00:12,911
letter of the correct choice here, and as a hint, notice that all of these

4
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:17,616
equations are in standard form. We can find the slope in the standard form using

5
00:00:17,616 --> 00:00:20,985
negative A over B. So what do you think for each of these?
