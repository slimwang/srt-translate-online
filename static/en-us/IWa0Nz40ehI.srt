1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,610
There's a number of ways that we
might consider risk in this scenario.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:09,440
Let's look at first, this idea of what's
the chance you might lose it all.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,950
So, you put out your bets
on the thousands tables.

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,400
The coins are flipped, in that event,

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,670
what's the chance you'll lose all,
all of your money?

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:22,270
In the single bet case where you put all
of your money on a single table, and

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,280
the outcome is determined by the flip of
a single coin, remember, even though it

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,450
is biased in your favor, there still is
a 49% change it'll come out against you.

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,010
So if you put all of your
money on a single table for

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,490
one coin, there's a 49% chance
that you'll lose all of it.

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,420
That's pretty high.

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,280
I mean consider that in
the context of would you put your

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,280
savings account on
a single bet like that?

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,130
Now, I want you to think a little bit,

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:56,078
consider the multi-bet case where we put
one token on each of the 1,000 tables.

16
00:00:56,078 --> 00:01:00,610
So there's 1,000 coin flips and
our return is determined by

17
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,450
the result of all those
individual thousand coin flips.

18
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,610
What is the chance that we
would lose it all in that case?

19
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:12,320
Well the answer to that is that it's
the probability that we lose on

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,620
the first table, times the probability
that we lose on the second table,

21
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,760
times the probability
we lose on the third.

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,580
And as you can see, we do this for

23
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,290
all of the thousandth table and multiple
those probabilities altogether, and

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,060
that's the probability we would lose
everything in the multiple bit scenario.

25
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,350
That is a very, very small number.

26
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:40,160
It's point four nine to
the one thousandth power.

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,970
How small is it?

28
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,268
Let's try and
calculate it on a calculator.

29
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:47,310
So it's 0.49 raised
to the 1,000th power.

30
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,720
Let's see how small that is.

31
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,220
It's so small it's not even a number.

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,910
That's how small it is.

33
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,090
Okay, let's look at another
way to evaluate risk.
