1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,170
Now, what do you think is the relationship between frequency, this how many

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:11,054
times per second the wave is being produced. And pitch. This perceived sound

3
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:12,520
quality of the wave.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,588
>> So if fast vibrations make high frequencies. >> Yes.

5
00:00:16,588 --> 00:00:18,490
>> Which sound like high pitch.

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,919
>> Exactly. High frequency means high pitch.
