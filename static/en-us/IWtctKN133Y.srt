00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,910
For this graph, the point x equals 1 belongs with the 2x minus 1 part of the

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:09,471
function, since its domain is x is greater than or equal to 1. Over on the

3
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:13,631
right, we should have this end point and this end point filled in. Since we

4
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:18,650
have f of x equals negative 2, for x is less than or equal to negative 3. And,

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,689
we have f of x equal 5 minus x, for 4 is less than or equal to x. Note that the

6
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:27,347
middle piece of the function, 1 half x minus 3, has an inequality that isn't

7
00:00:27,347 --> 00:00:32,398
inclusive for either of the numbers involved. So, that means, it should not

8
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:36,629
include negative 3 or 4, which we see with these open circles here. Awesome.
