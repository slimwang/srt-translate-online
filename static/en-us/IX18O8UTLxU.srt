Now, since it's my job to make your life difficult. I'm going to give you a nice

2
00:00:04,616 --> 00:00:09,133
complicated expression here. We have 7x squared plus 2x plus 1, all inside

3
00:00:09,145 --> 00:00:13,863
parentheses. And I'd like you to add that to this other quantity that's inside

4
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:18,152
parentheses. 4x squared minus 2x plus 4. And remember, I'd also like you to

5
00:00:18,164 --> 00:00:22,062
simplify as much as you can, so no more parenthesis and all like terms combined.

6
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:26,072
I know this looks complicated, but you know how to do this. And if you don't get

7
00:00:26,084 --> 00:00:27,140
it right, no big deal.
