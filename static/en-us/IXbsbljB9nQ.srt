1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,330
I'm sure all of us use, routinely,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,380
services on the internet such as email through

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,230
Google or Yahoo. And perhaps purchase things

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,490
using eBay or make orders for airline reservations

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,440
and so on. And when we do that, we think of an enterprise that we are accessing

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:25,370
from our work station or laptop or personal mobile device. We think of an

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,469
enterprise as a monolithic entity. But, in

8
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:31,082
fact, if you look inside the enterprise, the

9
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:34,030
enterprise, the intra enterprise view, is pretty

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,065
complicated. There's a whole bunch of services and

11
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:39,665
servers that are interconnected, there may be

12
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:43,565
marketing division, the sales division, the production division,

13
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:47,220
inventory division, the research division, and so on.

14
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,830
All of these constitute what an enterprise is.

15
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,030
So internally the view of the enterprise is much

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,550
more complex than what you see from the outside

17
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,450
coming in and using services provided by a particular

18
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,650
enterprise. Things get a lot more complicated in this day

19
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,640
and age because when we access an enterprise, in

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,920
fact, the enterprises, they talk to one another. And

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,320
this is, what is usually called a supply chain

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,260
model, and so on. Where, the service that you are,

23
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,800
requesting may not be serviced by, a single entity but may actually involve the

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,630
entity that you're contacting, contacting other entities

25
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,110
in order to. Put together a solution for

26
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,690
a particular request, and what is even

27
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:38,360
more challenging is when enterprises merge. For instance,

28
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,530
if three companies merge together, and this

29
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,290
happened a while back. There's a company called

30
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,350
Digital Equipment Corporation that got bought out by

31
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,650
Compaq and those two merged, and later on

32
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,815
HP bought out Compaq. And so you can see, that when things like this happen, the

33
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:57,400
inter-enterprise view is much more complex. And now

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,820
when companies merge like this, the idea of

35
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,010
an enterprise, the idea of an enterprise, becomes

36
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:08,000
an amalgam of three different entities coming together,

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,780
in this example for instance. So

38
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,310
the enterprise transformation challenges are many: interoperability

39
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,770
of the systems that constitute different

40
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,960
enterprises, interface compatibility when such merging happens,

41
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,540
system evolution. You know, things are

42
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,620
not stagnant, now this transformed enterprise has

43
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,480
to continuously evolve as well. Scalability,

44
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,400
reliability and the cost of maintaining a

45
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,780
complex system like that. All of these things are the

46
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,450
challenges that have to be faced both internally and across enterprises.
