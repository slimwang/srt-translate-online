00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,877
In general, when we solve an absolute value equation, we want to split it up

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:08,096
into two parts. One with an answer that's positive to represent the distance to

3
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:11,948
the right of zero, and one with an answer that's negative to represent the

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,989
distance to the left of zero, or negative 7. And here, since we have multiple

5
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:19,777
answers, we can list our answer as a solution set. So, the solution set is

6
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:23,941
negative 4 and 3. Remember to use the curly braces for the solution set. In

7
00:00:23,953 --> 00:00:27,616
general, we usually list the numbers from least to greatest.
