00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,910
Now that we've worked with expressions for a while, let's move on to some

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:09,151
equations. Please solve for x in the following equation. 3x squared plus 18

3
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:13,425
equals 0. Although there are a couple of different methods you could use for

4
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:17,457
solving this, I'd like you to try to do it without using the quadratic formula

5
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:22,953
this time. Please write the solutions in as concise a form as you can.
