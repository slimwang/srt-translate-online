00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,190
Alright, so with the symmetric distributions like our normal

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,230
distribution, the one sided p-value is simply going to

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,590
be half of our two sided p-value. Remember that

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,880
the p-value is the probability that given the null

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,340
hypothesis is true, we would observe a test statistic

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,800
at least as extreme as what we saw. So

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,630
instead of having both sides of this distribution, we're

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,440
really only going to have one side of the distribution.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,970
So we have a one-sided t-test where we're checking whether the

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,560
mean of sample one is greater than the mean of sample two.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,840
We still want p over two to be less than our p

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,640
critical, maybe that's 0.05, but we want our t value to be

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,410
greater than zero. Whereas for a less than one-sided t-test, where

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,820
we're testing whether the mean of sample one is less than the

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,870
mean of sample two, we want p over 2 to be less

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,590
than p critical, but we want our t value to be less

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,807
than 0.
