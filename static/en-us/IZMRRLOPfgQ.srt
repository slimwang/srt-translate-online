1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,170
Right, the first question.

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,640
Should scoreTeamA be local or global?

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,100
I'm going to answer this before
even moving onto the code.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,380
Now, you had a little bit of practice
with this in the earlier exercises.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,370
Given then the score needs to be saved
and modified for a longer period of time

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,386
and in between button clicks,
it should be global variable.

7
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:24,370
Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and
define it now because I have a little

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,810
bit of a better idea of where I should
define it because I'm making it global.

9
00:00:29,785 --> 00:00:31,292
Okay, here I am in the code.

10
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:34,300
I'm going to go over to the Java file,
and

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,500
you might see that
a couple things changed.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,440
Actually, really, the only thing that
changed is I added some comments here to

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,260
say what each of these methods does.

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,580
Besides that, everything's the same.

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,100
Okay.

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,870
So, I need to define a global variable.

17
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,850
I'm going to scroll up, and

18
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,540
the reason that I scroll up
is because by convention,

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,670
when I have global variables, I put
them right here at the top of the class.

20
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,750
The difference in location of where you
define a global variable versus a local

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,290
variable is that local variables
will be defined within methods,

22
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,160
whereas global variables will
be outside of the methods.

23
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,290
So I'm putting it outside right here.

24
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,970
Well, I know it's a number, and

25
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,590
because you're always going to score
at least one point, and you're

26
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,220
not going to score 1.5 points, this
number isn't going to include decimals.

27
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,240
So, a type of integer is actually
a pretty good choice here.

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,910
So, I'm going to type int.

29
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:26,710
Okay, and

30
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,080
after the data type comes the variable
name, and I'm going to use scoreTeamA.

31
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,620
Okay, and if I was just doing
a declaration, I'd be done.

32
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,270
But, I was also told to
initialize this to zero.

33
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,072
So, forget the semicolon for now.

34
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:45,620
I'm going to write the equal sign also
known as the assignment operator and

35
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,390
I'm going to set it to zero.

36
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,660
Oh, and don't forget the semicolon.

37
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,870
Okay, so, there's the answer for that.

38
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,590
Good work so far.
