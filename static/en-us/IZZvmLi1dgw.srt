00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,377
Thinking way back a few lessons ago, a combination of terms that are added

2
00:00:04,389 --> 00:00:09,118
together is an expression. A letter or symbol representing values that vary,

3
00:00:09,224 --> 00:00:14,122
keyword vary here, is a variable. Remember, you can really see and hear the word

4
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:18,913
vary inside variable. So, that's just a good way to remember what the function

5
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:23,708
of these things is. And finally, the product of variables and numbers is a term.

6
00:00:23,807 --> 00:00:27,865
A term is just a set of variables and constants that have been multiplied

7
00:00:27,877 --> 00:00:31,960
together. I hope this was a good review of some of the algebraic form we've

8
00:00:31,972 --> 00:00:32,779
learned so far.
