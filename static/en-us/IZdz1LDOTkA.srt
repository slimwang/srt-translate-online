1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,474
We just said that if we want to make a general statement about what the output,

2
00:00:04,474 --> 00:00:08,764
based on a general input for this function we're talking about here, would be,

3
00:00:08,764 --> 00:00:12,485
if the input was x, then the output would have to be x plus 2. Since the

4
00:00:12,485 --> 00:00:16,708
function of our function is to increase all input values by 2. So, to illustrate

5
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:20,551
this point a little bit differently, we're going to so some very, very basic

6
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:24,712
computer programming. Now, don't worry if you've never done anything like this

7
00:00:24,712 --> 00:00:28,872
before. This is just to illustrate how simple function works. You'll never be

8
00:00:28,872 --> 00:00:33,312
tested on this or anything. This is just for you to explore and have fun and

9
00:00:33,312 --> 00:00:37,835
maybe even understand things a little better. Now what we're going to do is to

10
00:00:37,835 --> 00:00:40,922
use one particular programming language called Python, to create the same

11
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:45,374
increase by 2 function that we just did. Now remember, that we said in a general

12
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:50,855
case of wanting to increase by 2, we take an input of x and then have our output

13
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:55,738
be x plus 2. It's the same thing as happening up here in these two lines of

14
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,709
code. The letters def stand for define and they're saying that we're going to

15
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:05,868
define or create a function, which is named IncreaseByTwo, and that function is

16
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:10,937
going to take in some input, this letter x in this case as the general case. And

17
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:16,666
that function is going to do some stuff and then spit out this output, x plus 2.

18
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:21,646
So, these two lines of code are basically creating the machine that this

19
00:01:21,646 --> 00:01:26,678
function is. The machine that transforms whatever input value it gets into some

20
00:01:26,678 --> 00:01:31,496
output value. Now, please notice here that we do have parentheses here around

21
00:01:31,496 --> 00:01:35,750
the input value. This is absolutely nothing to do with multiplication. These

22
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,024
parenthesis just indicate, this is what we are calling the input. Lets try it

23
00:01:40,024 --> 00:01:45,500
out. Lets see if this function works. Lets say that I want to use an input of 7

24
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:51,122
or plug in 7 in place of x in my IncreaseByTwo function. What number, do you

25
00:01:51,122 --> 00:01:55,167
think, this program is going to spit out in the end. Now again, you don't need

26
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:58,836
to know anything about how programs actually work. All you need to do is think

27
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:02,690
about the relationship between the input here and the output here. And see,

28
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:07,385
then, what the output would be if 7 is the input. Please put your answer in this

29
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:08,163
box over here.
