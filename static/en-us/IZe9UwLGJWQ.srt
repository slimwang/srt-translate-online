00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,990
So you still don't believe all
this particle filter mumbo jumbo?

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,497
Let's try a simple example.

3
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:10,160
Here's an ant scurrying along
on top of this crossword puzzle.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,790
It's one of those
computer-sciencey ants, so

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,260
it only moves one step at a time,
either horizontally or vertically.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,750
It can sense whether it's on
a black square or white square.

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,700
But that is it, it has no other way
of knowing where on the puzzle it is.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,180
Here is a sequence of
steps that the ant took.

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,680
The first column is time, t.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,660
The second column is its observation,
z, which is one for

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,080
white, and zero for black.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,610
The final column is that action taken,
or

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,860
u, which is basically what
direction did the ant move in.

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,830
For instance, at t equals 0,

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,880
the ant saw that it was on a white
square, and then it moved up.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,530
At t equals 1,
it observed a black square.

17
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,950
This was the result of moving
up in the previous step.

18
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,259
Okay, the next action was moving left,
and so on.

19
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:12,049
Can you figure out where
the ant is at t equals 5?

20
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,910
Mark the appropriate checkbox, or
boxes, if you're still unsure.
