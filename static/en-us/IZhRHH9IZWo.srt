1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,530
So what is competition photography?

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:07,330
Well, before we get that let's ask the question, what is photography?

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,990
And of course the best way to do this these days, if you believe that,

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:15,370
is to go search for it on the internet, and of course I will.

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,060
Just take a chance and see what the Wikipedia page on photography says about it.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,990
Couple of things too we should look at here.

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,600
One, photography is a science and art.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,250
It's a practice of creating images by recording light.

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,550
It could even be some other forms of things like electromatic,

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,060
electromagnetic radiation, but let's just stick to light.

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,090
Either electronically or by means of an image sensor.

12
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:42,870
Or chemically.

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,990
So that's of course film.

14
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,420
Electronic sensor is digital.

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,380
And to generate an artifact, an image.

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,830
So in essence, if you really think hard about it is, photography is a process of

17
00:00:53,830 --> 00:01:00,240
taking light from a natural environment and storing it in a form of an image.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,120
The literal definition of the term photography is drawing with light, all right?

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,010
I mean, that's the exact literal definition of the word photography.

20
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,880
In essence, what we are interested in is taking the light from a natural

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,148
environment most of the time and creating an image to store that information.

22
00:01:17,148 --> 00:01:21,670
And of course, what we I do this it depending on the application,

23
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,980
could be scientific, could be art, aesthetics, depends on the user at the end.

24
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,250
Of course to do this,

25
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,980
we have a variety of things that we can use, there is a lens that we

26
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:36,568
can play around with which of course then has variety different types of things.

27
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:40,490
A camera has a lens and we look at all those types of things again.

28
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,870
And again this part gets into the whole process of how an image would be

29
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:50,410
created from that kind of stuff and then what we do with it at the end, right.

30
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,330
So we can share it, we can print it.

31
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,600
So, basically the whole process of drawing with light and

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,640
using that to share the image, for a variety of purposes, either art,

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,790
science, is an important part of what we do with photography.

34
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,669
Of course it's related to many disciplines in science and manufacturing and

35
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,060
all that kinds of stuff and many different applications come in.

36
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,420
That's what makes photography very interesting and exciting.
