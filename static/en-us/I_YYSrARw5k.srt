1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,376
To calculate what direction we're firing, the first thing we need to do in our

2
00:00:03,376 --> 00:00:06,463
update code, is figure out whether or not the user has pressed one of the fire

3
00:00:06,463 --> 00:00:11,835
keys, fire0 or fire1. Once they have, the next step we need to do is figure out

4
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:16,425
what the player's position is in screen space. Our render engine actually

5
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:20,875
defines a function called getScreenPosition. Which will actually project a

6
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:25,350
world space position into the canvas screen coordinates. What this means is

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,806
that we'll now have the player's position in the same coordinate space as our

8
00:00:28,806 --> 00:00:33,348
mouse input. Because the two are now in the same space, we simply need to

9
00:00:33,348 --> 00:00:36,932
subtract the mouse input from the player position to give us an unnormalized

10
00:00:36,932 --> 00:00:42,018
vector. A simple normalized will give us a unit length vector. And we can now

11
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:45,846
use the directional vector as basis to launch our projectile towards the other

12
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,840
evil, evil robot.
