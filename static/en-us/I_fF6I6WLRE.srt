1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,870
So let's see if we can compute
the global and local miss rate.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,100
Suppose we have a level 1
cache that has a 90% hit rate.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,510
What is the local miss rate for
this cache, and

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,280
what is the global miss rate for
this cache?

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,487
And then let's suppose that we also have
a level 2 cache, where we have a hit for

6
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:25,954
half of the L1 misses, then the local
miss rate of this cache is what,

7
00:00:25,954 --> 00:00:29,590
and the global miss rate
of this cache is what?
