1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,916
Only the first answer is correct. In Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, and

2
00:00:03,916 --> 00:00:07,554
many other video games, you move through a 3D world and interact with it.

3
00:00:07,554 --> 00:00:12,048
Pixar's Toy Story was the first film made completely with computer graphics back

4
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:16,260
in 1995. It and many other animated films, such as the Ice Age series, use 3D

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,115
rendering techniques. However, the final product is not interactive. It's a

6
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:23,840
linear film that you have no real control over. Each image in a computer

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,726
animated movie can take from seconds, to minutes, to hours to compute depending

8
00:00:27,726 --> 00:00:31,341
on the complexity of the scene. That said, artists and technical directors

9
00:00:31,341 --> 00:00:34,733
working on these films depend on interactive rendering techniques to set up

10
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:38,990
lighting, design materials, and create animations. Computerized tomography or

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:43,464
other 3D image techniques gather slices of data. However, gathering the data by

12
00:00:43,464 --> 00:00:46,812
performing the scan is not the same as rendering this data. Pacman is

13
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:51,065
interactive and is rendered, but the scene described is entirely in 2D. Games

14
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:55,067
such as Angry Birds are also in this category where an illusion of 3D is

15
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:59,355
achieved by having 2D layers that move at different speeds. Mobile phones and

16
00:00:59,355 --> 00:01:02,853
tablets can certainly perform 3D rendering, but these particular games don't

17
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:04,063
need such capabilities.
