1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,460
In this case,
how does the ACL traversal happen?

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,193
That's what the question is about.

3
00:00:06,193 --> 00:00:08,300
You have a couple of different options.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,330
Remember in this case,
we want to grant access

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,190
when there's a positive access right,
and no negative access, okay?

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,800
Because negative takes precedence over
positive, that's what we have discussed.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,850
So for someone, there's a number
of cases you can think of.

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,380
If there's no positive and
no negative access,

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,786
then access should not be granted,
because there's no access.

10
00:00:27,786 --> 00:00:32,200
If there's positive and no negative
access then access should be granted.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,780
If there's both positive and negative,
the negative takes precedence and

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,110
negative should not be granted.

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,880
So in this case,

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,180
how does this get implemented
is what the question is about.
