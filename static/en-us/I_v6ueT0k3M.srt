1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:00,820
The correct answer,

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,660
of course, is that you want to make your predictions using your test dataset,

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,010
that's the whole point.

4
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,310
After this PCA transform,

5
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,350
your test dataset is now in the same form as your training dataset.

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,800
It's been, it's had the principle components analysis applied to it.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,600
So now you want to feed it into your Support Vector Classifier and

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,650
see what predictions you get.
