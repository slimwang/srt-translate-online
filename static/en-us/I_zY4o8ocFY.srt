1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,980
So before we go on to the next major computer

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,900
science topic we're going to introduce. I want to give you

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,980
one more quiz, to see if you can write a python

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,660
expression that's going to give you some idea how fast a

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,200
computer executes. So your goal for this quiz is to write

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,210
some python code that will print out how far light travels

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,100
in one nanosecond. Let me give you some information that will

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,820
help with this. So, the speed of light is 299,792,458 meters

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,500
per second. So, almost 300 million.

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,870
One meter is 100 centimeters. One nanosecond is one billionth of a second.

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:43,653
Which is 1 divided by 1000 000 000.

12
00:00:43,653 --> 00:00:47,249
So, your goal is to compute how far light travels in one nanosecond,

13
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:50,903
and to get that answer in centimeters. And I don't want this to be

14
00:00:50,903 --> 00:00:54,180
an algebra quiz. So, all you need to do is multiply

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,840
these three values together, and you'll get the answer we want.
