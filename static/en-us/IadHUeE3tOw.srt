00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,641
Once again, I've labeled some points on our complex plane. And I've labeled them

2
00:00:04,641 --> 00:00:09,026
with the letters a through h. For each of these three questions, I'd like you to

3
00:00:09,026 --> 00:00:13,184
fill in the letter that corresponds to the point that the question's asking

4
00:00:13,184 --> 00:00:17,736
about. So which point represents the number 7? Which one represents the number

5
00:00:17,736 --> 00:00:21,770
negative 7i? And which one represents the number negative 7 plus 7i?
