1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So because we're going to be writing an interpreter for JavaScript in HTML,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we're only really going to be able to interpret good programs successfully.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That means we want to recognize and rule out bad programs.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So here you can conceptually imagine some sort of border patrol or

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
gateway crossing where our diligent customs agent is going to keep out bad programs,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
like this "1"+2, while allowing in super-happy-fun programs like 1+2.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The process of looking at a program's source code, looking at its text,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
looking at the letters that make it up, and trying to see if it's going to be well-behaved or not

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
is known as type checking or semantic analysis.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And as you may already guess, it's not going to be perfect

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
but it's going to be pretty good.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Type checking and semantic analysis.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Semantic means "meaning."

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We're going to break a program down into its meaning.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And I'm going to explain types in just a minute.
