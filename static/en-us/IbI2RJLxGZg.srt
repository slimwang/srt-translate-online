Saying that a kitten is to cat what a
puppy is to a dog is a semantic analogy.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,420
Just like saying that shorter is
to short what taller is to tall

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,090
is a syntactic analogy.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,530
Here's a fun emergent properties
of those embedding factors.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,130
They let you express analogies like this
in terms of mathematical operations.

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,630
If you have a good model, and

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,380
you take the vector for puppy,
subtract the vector for

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,480
dog and then add back the vector for
cat, then you get another vector.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,490
If you look for what that vector
is closest to in imbedding space,

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,270
chances are that it will be kitten.
