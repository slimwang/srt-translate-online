1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:06,010
Many applications require configuration
settings in secret such as TLS certs

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,550
to run in a production environment.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,635
One problem we saw before when we used
Docker was that many devs want to

4
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:15,742
bake in their configs and
put those on the public Docker.

5
00:00:15,742 --> 00:00:16,920
Don't do it.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,960
So then what should we do?

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,333
Some say to put configuration
management tools into the Pod.

8
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,203
You can, you shouldn't.

9
00:00:26,203 --> 00:00:28,098
There's a better way.

10
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:32,400
In there are Configmaps and
Secrets to take care of these problems.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,210
Configmaps and

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,280
Secrets are similar except Configmaps
don't have to be sensitive data.

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,890
They can use environment variables and
they can tell downstream pods that

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,030
configuration is changed along a pod or
restart itself if necessary.

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,810
Let's talk about secrets.

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,900
It's really easy to create
a secret from a file.

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,080
Using the cube CTO
creates secret command.

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,280
In our example we've done this and

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,620
the Kubernetes Master already
knows about our secret.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,110
Then we can upload that secret to a pod.

21
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,850
Let's see how this works.

22
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,070
What happens if we start up
a pod that uses a secret?

23
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,080
Well after we run this cube CTO
create Pod command, a pod is created,

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,410
then our secret is mounted
onto our pod as a volume.

25
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,310
This way creators can make sure
that our configs are there

26
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,450
before our container start.

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,980
Once that volume is there,
we can take the contents of it and

28
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,040
expose it on the file system to
wherever our pods would go to mount it.

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,240
Then our pod starts to come online.

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,070
And finally our container is spun up.

31
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,700
We're good to go.

32
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,220
So now let's have Kelsey
teach us more about

33
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,070
creating Secrets to store
sensitive application data.

34
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,080
And creating Configmaps to
store application config data.
