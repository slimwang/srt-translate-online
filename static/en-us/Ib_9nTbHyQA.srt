00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:04,040
#HOLOYOLO and #MaterialYOLO have
both been used to praise and

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,920
ridicule Android design.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,670
So, what's the deal with them?

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,310
Much like the New York City skyline,

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,900
design in Android didn't come out fully
formed, but slowly built over time.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,550
In the beginning, there were years of
desolation where Android users had to

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,450
wait a long time for first party apps.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,900
And when they finally did come,
in many cases,

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,340
they were exact ports
of the iOS versions.

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,450
This all changed with the release
of Android 3.0 Honeycomb and

11
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,810
its HOLO theme.

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,910
The HOLO theme and
its refinements continued to flourish

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,295
in Ice Cream Sandwich,
Jelly Bean, and Kit Kat.

14
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:43,190
HOLOYOLO became a rallying call from
the users that expected the apps

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,480
they use to look like Android.

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,380
Sometimes, before the next
version was out of beta.

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,910
No longer could you say
that Android users and

18
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,500
developers don't care about design.

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,145
With the release of
Android 5.0 Lollipop,

20
00:00:57,145 --> 00:01:00,140
#HOLOYOLO gave way to #MaterialYOLO.

21
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,240
We learned in this course we really
shouldn't use the material theme if we

22
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,740
want to make our apps
backward compatible.

23
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,854
If anything,
we should say #AppCompatYOLO.

24
00:01:08,854 --> 00:01:09,579
You know?
