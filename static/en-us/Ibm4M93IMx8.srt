1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,540
My preferred way of tracking down this
problem is to set a breakpoint in

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,190
the add book to view method of
the breakpoint of the breakpoint

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,280
bug view controller.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,560
Then, if we run the application, we
notice that when we tap the screen and

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,920
we hit play, it seems like the add bug
to view is just being called over and

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,750
over again,
almost in a recursive fashion.

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,070
And by recursive I mean that
the frames keep adding and

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,860
they don't decrease until we've
reached some large number of bugs.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,740
And if we drag out the navigator,
we can see that after our first

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,060
add bug to view call, we have this
move bugs animation,that's then

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,390
calling addBugToView again and it just
continues all the way up the stack.

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,850
So let's tap this one and we can see
that we are making an extra call or

13
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,620
what appears to be an extra call here so
we'll delete that.

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,870
Whoops, I shouldn't have stopped
the application because now I'm missin

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,120
any debug information I have.

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,200
So my bad, let's do this again.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,750
We'll hit play and now it just,
oh, now we just have two bugs.

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,700
So how are we hitting this?

19
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,690
Let's run it one more time.

20
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,090
So we hit it once from
handleSingleTap and there we go.

21
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,370
We have an extra call here,
that's why we're getting two bugs.

22
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,830
So let's go ahead and
blow that one away and we'll try again.

23
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,708
This time, when we tap,
we'll disable that, play,

24
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:28,970
just one bug crawls onto
the screen at a time.

25
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,220
And that's the behavior that we want.
