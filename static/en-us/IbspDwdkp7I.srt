1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,150
Configuration is also
connected to classification.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,696
In case of classification, you establish
and then define, establish and

3
00:00:06,696 --> 00:00:07,680
then define.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,620
In case of configuration,
you're going to extension the plan,

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,870
assign the values to the variables,
refine and expand.

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,750
Extension the plan, assign values to
the variables, refine and expand.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,988
Second configuration leverages
classification's notion of prototypical

8
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:21,940
concepts.

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,760
So the hierarchy of plans
is organized around these

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,120
prototypical notions of
a components of a chair.

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,750
A chair typically consists of legs, and
seats, and arms, and back, and so on.

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,350
The ranges of values that these
variables can take are also part of

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,810
a prototypical knowledge of
various components of a chair.

14
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,690
In fact they are part of the default
value of this particular component.

15
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,010
Clearly there are also differences
between classification and

16
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,090
configuration.

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,020
We use classification to make
sense of the world by mapping

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,120
combinations of precepts
into equivalence classes.

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,790
We use configuration to act on
the world by designing actions.

20
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,280
>> So it sounds to me like while
classification is a way of making sense

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,810
of the world, configuration is
a way of creating the world.

22
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,170
With classification, we perceive
certain details in the world and

23
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,970
decide what they are.

24
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,880
With configuration,
we're given something to create and

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,760
we decide on those individual variables.
