00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,254
Let me show you what I did. I simply followed the pseudo-code that we developed

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:08,188
before. The first line already matches. Now I have to know whether there are

3
00:00:08,188 --> 00:00:11,776
more values. Well, the value'=s already in this doubles. And there's a queue at

4
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:16,160
the end. So I'll simply call the has next double method. Next I need to read

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,560
another input. I do that here. Then if the input is larger than the largest

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,174
value seen so far, I need to update the largest value. That's here and here.

7
00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:28,607
Let's give it a try. Here's my prompt. I'll just enter the values that we had

8
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:32,982
with the cards. Here are the inputs and the Q to terminate, and I'm told the

9
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:35,199
largest value is eight.
