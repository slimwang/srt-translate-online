1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,370
We've already seen how to change file
permissions using the chmod command.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,310
But what if you need to change
a files group or owner?

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,540
There are also commands
that allow you to do that.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,455
They are Chown.

5
00:00:12,455 --> 00:00:14,400
C-H-O-W-N.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,555
And change group.

7
00:00:15,555 --> 00:00:17,750
C-H-G-R-P.

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,460
We'll play with this bash history file
here located on our home directory.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,320
Its permissions are set so only
the owner can read and write the file.

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,700
This file stores a recent history of
every command the user has typed, so

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,950
it's for security reasons only that
the user can read and modify the file.

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,860
If you run cat on bash history,

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,230
you'll see that we can
currently read this file.

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,410
If we change the file's group to root
using this command sudo chgrp root and

15
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,270
then then name of the file.

16
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,070
If we try to cat this file again,
you'll see that we can still read it.

17
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,890
The group has no permissions on this
file, so there's pretty much no effect.

18
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,620
Our ability to read this file right now
is determined by the owner setting,

19
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,660
not the group setting.

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:10,230
But now, if we change the owner
to root of the bash history file,

21
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,300
you'll see that we can
no longer read the file.

22
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,790
Permission is denied, and this is
because only the owner can read and

23
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,565
write the file and that owner's root.

24
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,500
Our current user student would
fall in the everyone category and

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,440
they have no permission
at all to read this file.

26
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,090
Go ahead and change the owner and
the group back to student on this file.

27
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,030
We were just experimenting
to show these commands and

28
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,100
when you might need to use them.

29
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,160
Now let's move on to the last security
topic we'll discuss, firewalls.
