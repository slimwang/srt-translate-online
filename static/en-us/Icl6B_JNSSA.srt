1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,122
Before we go on I just wanted to have
you, kind of, think about one specific

2
00:00:04,122 --> 00:00:09,130
thing, and that is that can we determine
what kind of pattern gives you the most

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,250
discriminating information between
images at different defocus scales.

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,730
So, here basically are the four
different types sample aperture patterns

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,690
and a conventional aperture just
simplified to look like this.

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,830
Now, the score basically is the which
one of them is more discriminative.

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:24,760
Remember again,

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,830
when moving the object away
the pattern changes at the, sensor and

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,840
each one of them is going to give you
more detail about how far things are,

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,880
you know, and also that could be useful
figuring out defocus planes and depth.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,110
I'm just putting in you, know you, five
different examples on the score of which

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,910
one is more discriminative
versus less discriminative.

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,740
So what I'd like for you to do here is,
just put in a number.

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,650
Which one is the most discriminative,
and

15
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,420
which one is the least discriminative?

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,330
What would help you to look at is,

17
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,365
again, a little bit more on the
structure of these obstruction patterns.

18
00:00:56,365 --> 00:00:59,405
And again, symmetry is there in most
of them, but kind of starts giving you

19
00:00:59,405 --> 00:01:03,495
a little bit of x and y, but at the same
time, you also want to start looking at,

20
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:07,405
you know, what are the variations in,
the diagonals and stuff.
