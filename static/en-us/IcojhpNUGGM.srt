00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,160
Here's the start of our program. I've setup a few variables. Note the initial

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,975
balance of $100. My target of a million dollars. The interest rate of 1%, and

3
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:13,976
right now we're in year zero. In Java, you use the while loop to repeat

4
00:00:13,976 --> 00:00:19,162
statement. And that's exactly what we need. We want to repeat the statements

5
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:23,220
that add the interest. Here, we compute the interest. Here we add the interest

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,530
to the balance. Each time we do that, we also want to increment the year

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,670
because after all, we want to keep track of how many years this process takes.

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,864
And finally, we want to print out. Just so that we have a running total of the

9
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:39,444
current year and the current balance which is what you see here. How long do we

10
00:00:39,444 --> 00:00:42,996
want to do this? We want to do it while the balance is less than the target,

11
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:47,468
the balance starts out at a $100 gets larger and larger. Eventually, it'll

12
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:51,104
exceed the target and then the loop will stop. Now, let's run this program and

13
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:57,100
here it runs. Look at this, after 926 years, we've reached a million dollars.

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,390
That's actually not so bad. So, I have to wait less than a millenium to become

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,859
a millionaire. You can do the same thing.
