00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,386
You just saw one type of dependent samples t-test, where we test out and

2
00:00:03,386 --> 00:00:07,666
measure samples from two different populations. In the case of the last

3
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:11,150
example, the populations were the number of errors made typing the 20-word text

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:16,760
message within 30 seconds on each keyboard configuration. This is called the

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,085
repeated measures design. And the null hypothesis, is that these two population

6
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:25,178
means will be the same. Before we finish this lesson, I'll tell you about two

7
00:00:25,178 --> 00:00:30,400
other types of dependent samples t-tests. One is a longitudinal design, where

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,535
we measure a variable at one point in time and then we measure the same

9
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:39,086
variable for the same sample at a later point in time. And we want to know if

10
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:43,748
there's a significant difference between the variable at time 1 and time 2. So

11
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:47,096
the null hypothesis will be exactly the same symbolically as for repeated

12
00:00:47,096 --> 00:00:51,719
measures design. Only with this design we're putting a lot of time in between

13
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,030
measuring the variables. And then, a third type of dependent sample's design is

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,270
a pretest posttest, where we measure a variable, implement some kind of

15
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,672
treatment, and then measure the same variable for the same sample after the

16
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:10,636
treatment to see if there was a significant effect due to the treatment. Again,

17
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:14,662
the null hypothesis is the same, that the variable won't significantly change

18
00:01:14,662 --> 00:01:19,614
before the treatment and after the treatment. You'll see examples of these two

19
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:25,008
types of designs in problem set 10. Great job. T-tests are pretty complicated,

20
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:30,062
so now dive deeper with Dr. Laraway. He's going to go into more detail on these

21
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:33,478
concepts and then go through a full one sample t-test so you can get a lot of

22
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:37,650
practice and really understand how to use these.
