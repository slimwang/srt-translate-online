So is this program free of bugs? It would be nice if a debugger just took all

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:08,872
of the bugs out but it can't tell us. As Edgar Dijkstra said, testing can only

00:00:08,872 --> 00:00:13,350
show the presence of bugs, not their absence. I bet you can think of a test

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,670
case that demonstrates another bug in this code. If so, post it on the forum.
