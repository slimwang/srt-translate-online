00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,770
Evaluation too can play a very important role in the iterative loops in

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,770
this analogical reasoning process. One can use several different methods for

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,820
doing evaluation. In the robot that can walk on water, for example, we can do

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:18,170
a simulation, or we can build a physical prototype. If the evolution succeeds,

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,700
then well and good, we can encapsulate the target polymer solution as a case and

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,450
store it in case memory. If the evaluation fails, we may need to

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,550
revisit transfer and see whether we want to transfer some of the knowledge or

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:36,140
revisit mapping, and perhaps align things differently or revisit retrieval and

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,470
perhaps try to retrieve a different source case. As an example,

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,930
supposing that the evaluation shows, then the robot that we designed for

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,990
walking on water is a little too heavy. In that particular case, we may

12
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,820
change the problem specification and retrieve a different kind of organism that

13
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,660
perhaps is a little lighter. Let us suppose that we evaluate the design of

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,150
the robot that can walk on water and find that the design is a little too heavy.

15
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,810
In that case, we can go back to the transfer stage and see whether we can

16
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,420
transfer some of the relationship that might make the robot a little lighter. Or

17
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,180
we can go back to the mapping stage and see whether we can align the source case

18
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,490
and the target problem slightly differently so that we can transfer a different

19
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,920
relationship. Or alternatively, we can go back to the retrieval state and try to

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,840
retrieve a source case, a different kind of biological organism altogether.

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,250
Thus, we see that the process of analogical reasoning is not linear at all and

22
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,150
see it can have many different kinds of iterations.

23
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,915
Analogical reasoning continues to be an important topic in our research and

24
00:01:36,915 --> 00:01:39,100
biological-inspired design is becoming one.

25
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,530
We provide several readings with both topics in the class notes.
