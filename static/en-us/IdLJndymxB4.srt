1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,925
So I'm going to use my little friend on the right.

2
00:00:01,925 --> 00:00:03,400
>> Yeah, the quick access menu.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,219
>> I haven't used him in a while.

4
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:04,219
>>

5
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:04,461
[LAUGH].

6
00:00:04,461 --> 00:00:05,680
>> That's nice. Okay. new field.

7
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,420
>> Exactly.

8
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,910
>> because the object already exists. It's a relationship.

9
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,780
>> It's a relationship, and it's going to be a lookup. And, mainly because

10
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,450
you can't actually do a master detail to a user object, that's just one

11
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,386
of the requirements in sales force. But also, we already have all of those

12
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:24,371
records created, so we couldn't even do a master detail if we wanted to.

13
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:28,886
>> Okay, so, it's related to, user.

14
00:00:28,886 --> 00:00:29,760
>> Right.

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,190
>> And, of course, the next ritual.

16
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,160
>> So, you want to change that to say Stage Manager instead of User.

17
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,640
>> Okay, that makes sense. Okay, so we've added our user field.

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,530
>> Right there, yeah, sweet. Stage manager, look up to the user. Great.

19
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:47,700
>> Cool.

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,310
>> So, let's go back to the Udacity stage and make you the manager.

21
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,030
>> Yeah! OK, Udacity stage.

22
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,335
>> So there's the Stage Manager field, you can just double-click it.

23
00:00:58,335 --> 00:01:02,020
>> Okay, so, I can double-click here. Use my magnifying glass friend.

24
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,250
>> Sweet.

25
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,340
>> And, it already knows, I'm a user. That's, that's creepy Sam. I

26
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,440
don't like when, Sales force creeps me out. How do they know that?

27
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,280
>> Well, you're the logged in user right now, and you're

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,050
the only user in your organization because you just created it today.

29
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:20,440
>> Okay. And I don't have a role, but presumably I could. Okay.

30
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:20,690
Save.

31
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,880
>> Yeah. And we even could have created a filter to

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,440
only show people by certain roles to show up in this lookup.

33
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,190
>> Cool. Okay. So, we've done it.

34
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:30,870
>> Great.

35
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,460
>> I'm managing stages.

36
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,885
>> You're the manager of the stages now.

37
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,910
[LAUGH].
