1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,790
So, this is what I've come up with.

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,640
I have the modal's HTML, inside the body of our page.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,630
It has its own unique id, which in this case is project1.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,000
It's got its own label, which is Favorite App Page.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,020
And then inside modal-body, we have some custom content, including an image and

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,870
a big block of text.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,630
At the very bottom, we've got a button here that will Close our modal.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,560
Scrolling up.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,010
We see that for the image, for the same FAVORITE APP projects,

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,000
we've got a new attribute called data-toggle and it's equal to modal.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,980
And the target is of course project1.

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,420
Put it all together and we get to come to our page.

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,650
