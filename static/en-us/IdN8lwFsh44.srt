00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:12,803
Almost done, almost done.

3
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:18,005
That's it,
that's the whole thing and send.

4
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:20,965
[SOUND] Whoa, pizza.

>> Large pepperoni and
crazy sticks for Marty McCapp.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,750
>> Micky P.I., that's me.

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,729
>> Cool, here you go.

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:33,530
>> Thank goodness you're here.

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,110
I'm so hungry, I've been writing
this algorithm for hours.

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,198
I solved the flux photon algorithm.

12
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:40,258
>> Yeah, cool.

13
00:00:40,258 --> 00:00:41,900
Okay.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,355
>> You know this algorithm's
going to change the world, right?

15
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:46,205
>> [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.

17
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,317
>> And, send.

18
00:00:53,317 --> 00:00:56,280
No, no, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,450
You can't die, you can't die.

20
00:00:59,174 --> 00:01:02,983
Just turn back on, come on.

21
00:01:02,983 --> 00:01:05,583
Open up messages.

22
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,243
Where is it?

23
00:01:07,243 --> 00:01:11,787
Where's the algorithm?

24
00:01:11,787 --> 00:01:14,627
No, what am I going to do?

25
00:01:14,627 --> 00:01:16,717
Doc, Doc will know.

27
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:26,806
>> Hello?

28
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:31,497
[SOUND] Hello, who's this?

29
00:01:31,497 --> 00:01:33,145
>> Doc, it's me, Marty.

30
00:01:33,145 --> 00:01:35,246
I solved the flux photon algorithm.

31
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:36,744
I had it written down.

32
00:01:36,744 --> 00:01:40,034
I was going to send it to you and

33
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:45,625
then my phone died and
I don't know what to do.

34
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:49,423
>> We have to go back Marty,
back to the past and then both in.

35
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:50,177
We're sisters.
