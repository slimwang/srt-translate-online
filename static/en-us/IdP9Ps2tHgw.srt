00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,779
This statistic here is for a one sample t test. This is just like the z tests

2
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:10,681
you learned in lesson nine. It's a one sample t test because we only have one

3
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:16,170
sample, with mean x bar. For the first part of this lesson, we'll focus on one

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,170
sample T tests and then later we'll focus on comparing two samples. We want to

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,460
know if the population that this sample comes from is significantly different

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,702
than the population with this mean. Therefore, the null hypothesis is that the

7
00:00:31,702 --> 00:00:37,418
population mean is equal to some specified value. Mu naught, and the

8
00:00:37,418 --> 00:00:42,410
alternative hypothesis can be either that mu is less than mu naught, greater

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:48,610
than mu naught, or just not equal to mu naught. When we calculate the t

10
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,450
statistic, the numerator is the difference between the sample mean and this

11
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,350
value, where the sample mean is the point estimate for the population mean mu,

12
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,310
and the denominator measures the amount of difference between the population

13
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:07,144
mean and mu naught That we would expect by chance. Again we have our alpha

14
00:01:07,144 --> 00:01:11,634
levels which are written in the column headers of the t table. The t table

15
00:01:11,634 --> 00:01:16,420
tells us the t critical values that mark the cut off point for the alpha

16
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:22,955
levels. If our t stastics is greater than these t critical values. Or if we get

17
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:27,180
a negative T statistic that is less than the negative T critical value cutting

18
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,663
off that alpha level, then we can reject the null.
