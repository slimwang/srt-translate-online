1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,680
The truth assignment that I
used is false, true, true.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,050
I used the rule that yi is equal to
the disjunction of the first i plus one

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:14,400
literals, and any satisfying assignment
yi being true implies this disjunction.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,430
But yi can sometimes be false,
even when this expression is true.

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:23,460
For example, another way to extend
this assignment is to let y2 be false.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,342
Regardless of how we set y2 this
clause here is still satisfied by x3,

7
00:00:29,342 --> 00:00:33,580
and this clause here is
still satisfied by x4 bar.

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,170
Thus, there isn't a unique way to
extend the original assignment, but

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,980
it is true that this way of
extending it always works.
