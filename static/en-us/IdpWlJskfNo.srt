1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,930
So let's dig deeper into, how the agent may do the processing using this

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,050
primitive action. So, consider the sentence John pushed the cart. The AI

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,530
agent beings left to right, because we're talking about English language here.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,980
He first word here John is not a verb. So, the AI agent for

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,470
the time being, puts this in a list of concepts. And

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,400
ignores it it comes to the second word in the sentence. Which is pushed,

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,700
there's a word here, pushed, and now the AI agent uses this particular verb,

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,650
push, as a probe into it's longterm memory. So now, the frame for

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,330
propel is going to get pulled out, let's see what the frame would look like. So,

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,750
here is the frame for propel that has been pulled out of the longterm memory?

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,330
And this frame tells us that we can expect an agent.

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,540
We can expect an object. And indeed, although we are not shown here, this frame

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,030
may have additional slots and perhaps additional things can be expected. Now for

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,160
each of the slots, there is a rule budding in here. A rule which tells us,

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,910
how can we pull out from a sentence, the entity that goes under the slot?

16
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,340
The filler that must go here. So here's a rule that says that.

17
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:12,700
If there is a concept just before the word, and that concept is animate,

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,790
then, whatever that concept is, put it here. Well, there is a concept just

19
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,880
before push, that's John, and let's suppose we have a lexicon which tells us if

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,550
John is animate, then we put John here. Similarly there is a rule here for

21
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:29,230
this slot, which tells the agent that if there is a object,

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,440
there is a concept that comes after this verb. And that particular

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,600
concept refers to an object that is inanimate. Then, take that particular thing,

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,540
and put it here, and that's the cart. And so, we put cart here. So this way,

25
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,380
this particular scheme, helps us derive the meaning of, John pushed the cart.

26
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,890
And notice that the processing is a combination of bottom up and

27
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,270
top down, as we discussed earlier. It begins, bottom up.

28
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,670
Because we are looking at the data. Right now we don't have knowledge. But,

29
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,970
as soon as some data is processed, it pulls in knowledge from memory. And

30
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,800
soon the processing becomes top down, this frame helps to general expectations.

31
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,920
And help pull things out. This is almost acting, like a hook for

32
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,830
a fish. So once you have the hook, then you can capture the fish well. There

33
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,780
are several things to be noted here. First representations like this. First,

34
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,770
representations like this, are called structure knowledge representations.

35
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,050
There's not only a representation here, but, there is a strong structure to it.

36
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,720
Earlier when we were discussing predicates and logic, or we discussing rules and

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,210
antecedents and consequence of rules. They are like the atoms of

38
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,196
knowledge representation. They don't have much structure. But by now,

39
00:02:38,196 --> 00:02:41,380
we have this molecule of forms knowledge representation. And

40
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,960
which a large number of atoms are getting connected with each other.

41
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,000
And this connections are important, because once you have that structure of

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,740
the molecule it tells you what can go in the place of each atom. Second, this

43
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,820
is a simple sentence, and so the processing was quite simple. The sentences need

44
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,580
not always be as simple as this one. What happened to the sentence had the word,

45
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,800
push in it? And I picked a frame, that is not the right frame for it.

46
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,620
Suppose I had pulled out a frame for move object is shown as propel here. Well,

47
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,610
one possibility is, that if you were to select a different frame for making

48
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,240
sense of this particular sentence, there's a high I try to fill the slot for

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,660
this particular frame, I will find a lot of difficulty. In which case,

50
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,740
I might abandon the frame and try a different one. The second possibility is,

51
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,680
that I may even force the interpretation of this into the slots for

52
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,130
the other frame. But, if there is a study here which contains large number of

53
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,840
sentences then, soon I'll realize this is not the right frame,

54
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,010
I may abandon it and pick different frame. So for complex sentences,

55
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,510
this processing is not as linear as we have pretended it to be right here.

56
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:53,650
It is also possible, that sometimes one of the words en-map into two frames

57
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,955
equally well. Indeed, this is the basis of many of the [UNKNOWN] we encounter.

58
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:03,620
So consider, I was wondering why the ball was becoming bigger. Then it hit me.

59
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,080
Now, you of course understand the word hit there, that particular word,

60
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,220
maps into two different interpretations, and that's why it is interesting and

61
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,500
funny. So here's another one. Two men walk to the bar to,

62
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,490
the third one ducks. Now here the word, the bar is overloaded. So here,

63
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,770
walked into the bar, is getting interpreted two different ways.

64
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,430
Indeed, people have tried to build accounts of humor, based on the kinds of

65
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,830
story interpretation that we are doing here. Could it be, that this is beginning

66
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,416
of a theory of humor. Of how you can tell stories not only to your machines?
