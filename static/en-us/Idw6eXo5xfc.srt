1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:05,792
So world-class entrepreneurs are never lucky. Never.

2
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:11,345
You make your own luck. It’s a big idea you know At a

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,300
single point in time, you’ll say, yeah, just happened to be

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,822
there when X happened there. Geez, that’s just kind of

5
00:00:16,822 --> 00:00:20,481
happened and I was there when somebody said X or Y

6
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:24,423
over a career. You will now look back and go you were not

7
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:27,336
lucky. You showed up more than other people. You took

8
00:00:27,336 --> 00:00:29,820
advantage of more other people you raised your hand

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,900
more often, you were there more often you got on a plane

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,463
where everybody else went ‘ah, it’s too much of a hassle.

11
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:40,604
World-class entrepreneurs do that over time consistently.

12
00:00:40,604 --> 00:00:43,531
And you could tell the difference of whether you’re gonna

13
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:47,070
make it or not is when everybody else says ‘nah, too much

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,233
worker ‘what do you mean I got to drive over there’ or ‘you

15
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:52,436
mean I have to talk to those guys it’s just too much about’

16
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:55,892
or nah that is just too hard.’ I want you to remember that.

17
00:00:55,892 --> 00:01:00,522
That adds up over time in a career and you will start making

18
00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:03,379
your own luck and you will find because stuff will start

19
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:06,377
coming your way. Does this make sense, right? Yes, this

20
00:01:06,377 --> 00:01:10,525
conference happened to happen but you guys decided to

21
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:13,732
go to it. Somebody who I gave you a little hint that perhaps

22
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:18,434
you needed to do that. But my point is don’t – right

23
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:22,338
don’t ever think what happens to other people and

24
00:01:22,338 --> 00:01:25,465
I want you guys to understand the distinction between

25
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:28,772
standing there waiting for direction versus making your

26
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:32,337
own direction by making it happen. So just as an side

27
00:01:32,337 --> 00:01:34,486
keep going, guys, this is good. Well, we

28
00:01:34,486 --> 00:01:37,353
thought these guys would know this big problem so it's

29
00:01:37,353 --> 00:01:43,577
existed. It’s a big shift, right, where you think they are just

30
00:01:43,577 --> 00:01:46,572
going to grab it out with your hands and now you realized,

31
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:48,864
geez, there is a portion of evangelism here and just

32
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:51,806
to remember, if you’re right and new market turns into an

33
00:01:51,806 --> 00:01:54,684
existing market fairly rapidly, right? Yeah, yeah. But at least

34
00:01:54,684 --> 00:01:58,007
on day one, when you’re ahead of the game with the things

35
00:01:58,007 --> 00:02:02,119
you need to do about evangelism about scale, about

36
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,923
wether you are selling or evangelizing is really kind of

37
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:07,694
different. pitching team other comments or..? That’s alright -

38
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,305
quickly it that getting the people you’re talking to as

39
00:02:10,305 --> 00:02:12,801
your customers to be talking about this problem itself is part

40
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:15,812
of your journey now as he explained. Getting that message

41
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:19,504
out there and making your company solution part of the

42
00:02:19,504 --> 00:02:21,903
conversation at all the conferences six months and a year

43
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:24,627
from now, is like a critical thing to do, because if you do it

44
00:02:24,627 --> 00:02:26,670
your portfolio’s looking better then. ..that...

45
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:30,061
So the point is this that a lot of – the reason

46
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:32,016
of pushing on these points that we’re

47
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:34,907
talking about these things is a lot of the pivots are

48
00:02:34,907 --> 00:02:36,852
off understanding the complexity of that chart, more

49
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:40,040
the pivots are off there are some complexity the markets

50
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,198
not penetrable understanding the ecosystem, there’s no

51
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:45,532
insertion point for a new technology or new company.

52
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,589
Those are probably more of the reasons for the pivot

53
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:50,938
stand around the core technology. So the sooner

54
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:52,736
you understand that ecosystem, the sooner you’ll

55
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:55,953
have a sense of where you want to stay with it. And just

56
00:02:55,953 --> 00:02:58,583
you know, hope to see that in you guys, you may look at the

57
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:02,173
fuel cell market structure and go ‘it’s just not penetrable

58
00:03:02,173 --> 00:03:04,555
for a new entrant even though the technology is applicable.

59
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:08,338
Right. So what are you doing for tomorrow? For tomorrow,

60
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:12,917
we’re going to go try and visit the planning board for

61
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:17,117
Redwood City and see what they’re thinking about

62
00:03:17,117 --> 00:03:19,838
is that - they’re working on this cost per vote the salmation

63
00:03:19,838 --> 00:03:21,984
plant trying to talk with them about how they are

64
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,510
thinking about that project. And some of you are

65
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,255
probably wishing that now but I have to tell you how

66
00:03:27,255 --> 00:03:30,017
proud I am of each and everyone of you here because

67
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:32,659
you’re going to look back and what you did here, most

68
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:36,238
of you, and go ‘holy cow did we actually do that in a class

69
00:03:36,238 --> 00:03:38,991
or we were taking a course and doing work and everything

70
00:03:38,991 --> 00:03:43,123
else? and so for me, it’s just a really impressive effort on

71
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:47,042
all your parts. Any other comments? Yeah, I’m guessing

72
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:49,919
for some of you this was the hardest class you might

73
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,369
have taken. And that’s the intent because as hard as

74
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:58,042
this class might have been, it’s so much easier then when

75
00:03:58,057 --> 00:04:01,705
you get out and do it for real. So the laboratory was a sort

76
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:04,500
of safe place to stretch your muscles and see if it fits.

77
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,886
And for a lot of you, I think it does and I’m thrilled to have

78
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:09,522
been a part of it, I think you guys have done a great job

79
00:04:09,522 --> 00:04:13,348
yeah. Thank you, guys, congratulations and best of luck

80
00:04:13,348 --> 00:04:16,168
to all you on Monday. Next Monday you start it for yourself

81
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:21,137
for real.So final comment. I would just share is that

82
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:26,440
by design this class is not taught, right. It’s experienced We

83
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,038
set up a framework under Steve’s leadership that gets

84
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:32,806
you out of the classroom and then we all sort of monitor each other
