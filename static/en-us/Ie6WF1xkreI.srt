1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,270
So let me introduce some terms here.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,350
One, first term I want introduce is Exposure.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,100
Now if you notice in lenses,

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:14,090
we basically can open the lens to be really small, or much wider.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,990
But just having this kind of a change on how big I want the size of

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,800
the aperture, which is the opening here.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,320
I can now vary a lot of different types of things.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,420
So now, let's see what impact does aperture have on exposure.

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,549
If we define aperture by capital H, basically what we're interested in is that

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:40,460
exposure is equal to irradiance times the time that the exposure was open.

11
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,530
We can simply write this equation down as H, where the h is the exposure,

12
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,170
irradiance, we define by term E, and time by T.

13
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,570
Basically, an exposure is irradiance on the sensor, for

14
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,780
the amount of time that it was hitting the sensor.

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,860
That is basically, the amount of light thatâ€™s coming in and

16
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,640
hitting the sensor for, and how long defines exposure.

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,180
So what is irradiance?

18
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,780
So again, irradiance, in essence, is the amount of light, the measure of

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,020
amount of light that falls on the unit area of a sensor per second.

20
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,320
And it's denoted by capital E here.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,570
So the amount of light that will hit a sensor depends on

22
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,170
the opening of the aperture.

23
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,550
So in essence it's controlled by the aperture size.

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,140
Here a small opening.

25
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,390
A larger opening, of course,

26
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:35,990
larger opening will let a lot more amount of light per unit area of the sensor.

27
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,140
And this of course, will have a lot less light going through.

28
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,380
And of course, exposure time is the timing that we allow the light to

29
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,780
go through this opening or that opening.

30
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,780
That is best designated by the, how long the shutter is kept open.

31
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,930
So now we've looked at aperture, which is the opening.

32
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,870
And shutter is basically how long we keep this open.

33
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,280
That lets me get to the exposure that I'm am interested in for an image.
