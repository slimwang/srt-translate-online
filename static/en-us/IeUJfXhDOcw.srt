1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,943
The adoption program has three
co-dependent components.

2
00:00:05,943 --> 00:00:10,686
EHR certification specifies
the minimal acceptable EHR

3
00:00:10,686 --> 00:00:14,890
capabilities that vendors must provide.

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,010
So it's the vendors of the EHRs
who obtain EHR certification.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,750
Meaningful use specifies
the minimal provider

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,490
usage of a certified EHR in order
to qualify for incentive payments.

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,670
And of course the incentive
payments themself are specified and

8
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:40,260
come from either the Medicare program or
the Medicaid program to hospitals and

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,580
eligible providers, but
they can't be paid by both programs.
