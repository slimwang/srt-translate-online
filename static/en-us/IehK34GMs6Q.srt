1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,700
So let's just make
a little room here and

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,630
we'll copy this equation
down one more time.

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,600
But this time what we're going to
do is instead of considering

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,830
this weighted combination of
the Q values at state S prime,

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,530
weighted by the probability
of reaching S prime.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,140
Let's just make it simple and

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,860
just worry about the S prime
where the difference is largest.

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,160
Since this is a weighted average,
or a convex combination,

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,090
it can't be any larger than
the biggest difference at any S prime.

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,560
So we're going to do that,
we're going to copy that down and

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,990
max it over S primes.

12
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,820
And we don't need to include
the max over a and S anymore,

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,090
because you'll notice this expression
doesn't even have a and S in it anymore.

14
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,140
So actually, by considering this kind
of worst case version we don't have to.

15
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,100
We don't have that max anymore.

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,320
>> And that gets us from
an equal to a less than an equal

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,520
>> This gets us from an equal to a less

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,600
than an equal that's right
because we're bounding it.

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,730
It could actually be a bit wider here.

20
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,470
We're considering the worst
possible next state in terms of

21
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,760
the difference between
these Q functions.

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,810
>> Okay.
>> And now you can see that it's

23
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,740
actually getting pretty close
to where we want to end up.

24
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:09,510
The main difference, in fact, let me
rewrite this max norm equation out.

25
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,090
So when we write that out we get gamma
times the max over state action pairs.

26
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,338
And I'm going to write s prime and

27
00:01:15,338 --> 00:01:18,150
a prime to make it easier to
match up with the other equation.

28
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,710
It's however we're indexing
over the state action pairs

29
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,960
that make up Q1 and Q2.

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,890
So this max norm is really just the max
over those of the difference between

31
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,710
the two Q functions, and
this is where we are at the moment.

32
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,650
We have something like
gamma max over S prime, and

33
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,820
these maxes are trapped
in the absolute value.

34
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,480
It would be really nice if we could move
these maxes out of the absolute value,

35
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,140
and have it this way so
now the a primes actually match up.

36
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,470
Here this is the max action
according to the Q function Q1 and

37
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,710
this is the max actions
according to Q function Q2 and

38
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,788
it would good if we could just
talk about them together.

39
00:01:55,788 --> 00:02:00,160
So this is kind of to me anyway
this is the most fun most exciting

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,644
most interesting step because
this turns out to be true.

41
00:02:03,644 --> 00:02:08,530
[LAUGH] Right, that we can
actually move these maxes out, and

42
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,940
then we get a valid sequence.

43
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,960
So I'm going to focus in
on this step in a moment.

44
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,450
But let's just accept it for the time
being, that we can move these maxes out.

45
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,250
Now we've actually completed
the algebra that we needed to complete.

46
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,256
The difference between the two Q
functions after we apply the Bellman

47
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:28,814
operator is actually less than or equal
to gamma, something smaller than 1,

48
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:32,420
times what the distance was
before we applied the Q operator.

49
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:40,138
I'm sorry, the B operator of the
Bellman Operator of a value iteration.

50
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:45,640
>> Wow, so Bellman and
value iteration converges,

51
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,130
except for this magical step
you're about to explain to me.

52
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,620
>> Except for the magical step, yeah.

53
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,600
And the magic step is fun because it's,
I alternate between as seeing it as

54
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,640
completely obvious, and of course this
is true, and being completely mystified

55
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,730
and don't understand how
it could possibly be true.

56
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,010
And my brain just sort of flips back and

57
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,450
forth between those kind of
like a Necker cube.

58
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,830
So let's dive in and
make sure that this property holds,

59
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,650
knowing that once we establish
that we get the whole chain,

60
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,050
we get the whole
contraction operator thing.

61
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,690
We get all the power of
contraction operators

62
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,260
in when we're doing Bellman Optics.
