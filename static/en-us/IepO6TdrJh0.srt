00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It is only 73.3, which is 11/15. But that could just be a sample error.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It could actually be 90% as advertised and you were just unlucky, but we believe

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that high probability of this is correct or is the data actually contradicting this claim

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and you should complain that the claim is incorrect.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the essence of hypothesis testing. We make decisions whether a hypothesis is correct.
