1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,530
Recall that by default, the browser assumes that

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:06,250
css is blocking, hence the first link tag will

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,340
block rendering. The screen query will evaluate the true,

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,050
since we are rendering the content on the screen

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,300
and hence it will also block rendering. The

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,320
third declaration depends on the orientation of the device.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,300
In this particular case because the handset is in

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,270
portrait orientation. It won't be a render blocking resource.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,580
Finally, the last declaration is only applied

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,450
when the page is being printed. Hence,

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,410
it is not render blocking when the page is first being loaded in the browser.

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,400
>> Nice. So, only two of the four are

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,050
render blocking. I can feel the pages getting faster already.
