1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This was actually a really tricky question.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So let's, first, mark down the answers,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and now we can talk about why.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So these were the answers and let's think about why.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We have some really interesting behavior over in some of these graphs,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and it's nice to think about what's causing that behavior.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So let's start with number 2.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Pretty straight forward. The robot does exactly what we want.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It starts off away from the track, then it approaches it, and stays right on the track.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's exactly what we want PID to do, so this is no problem.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Number 3 looks similar to number 2 but not quite because now you can see the line

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that we're approaching is not actually the track.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's because we're reaching the steady state where the robot's upward drift

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
is being balanced by its downward tendency caused by this term,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and though we reach some sort of steady state, it's not the steady state we want,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
which would be right on the track.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The key to understanding number 4 was realizing that the robot

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
starts by moving upwards.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is the only case for the robot started going up,

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and what's happening here is the drift is dominating since the toe p is equal to 0,

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
there is no initial term that steers the robot towards the goal,

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and without that, the drift is going to take over.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Of course, as we accumulate error that gets corrected for and we steer down,

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
but eventually we get into this sort of oscillating behavior.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The oscillations are not as frequent, however, as they are in case number 1.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If we think of this differential CTE term as a sort of smoothing term,

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
which damps out these wild oscillations.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Then we can see how, if tow d is equal to 0, we would expect these sort of

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
growing oscillations, and this behavior is characteristic of any PID controller

30
00:01:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
where the differential term is too small.
