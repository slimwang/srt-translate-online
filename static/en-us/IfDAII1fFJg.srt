00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,370
The answer is, that the program doesn't

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,650
have any concurrency. The two threads can't run

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,590
at the same time anymore. One of them will always be able to run, so there's

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,180
no dead lock. And of course, two threads can use the same block. That's kind

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,390
of the whole point, and two procedures can

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,350
too as we've seen in a previous example.
