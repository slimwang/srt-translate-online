00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,770
In lesson two,

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,880
we looked at different ways that IOS
apps present multiple pages of content.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,740
We said that we'd return for
a deep dive into how side to

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,400
side navigation presentation works,
and here we are.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,966
Using navigation controllers is
an absolutely fundamental skill.

6
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:19,350
We're also going to take one more step
with the iTable views and make and

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,110
app that responds when
a user taps a table row.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,530
An essential interaction when
navigating a multi page app.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,850
Let's look at a few examples
of side to side navigation.

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,750
Here in the settings app,
you can see that taping on a cell drills

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,260
down into the next layer of
the navigation hierarchy.

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,490
The settings app has multiple layers.

13
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,210
Let's say,
I want to change my Siri settings.

14
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,780
I tap General and then Siri, Language,

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,570
and then I can give Siri
an Australian accent.

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,870
I can always return to the previous
view with this Back button,

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,160
ultimately bringing me back
to the root view controller.

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,630
Notice how intuitive this flow is.

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,990
Users have come to expect this type of
movement through a layered structure.

20
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,400
If you take advantage of iOS UI
conventions in your app design.

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,060
Your users won't need to be told how
to find what they're looking for.

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,110
But let's check out the IOS music app.

23
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,330
If I go into the more tab it
brings up a table of options.

24
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,660
Then if I drill down into genres and
country, eventually.

25
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,130
I can bring up the songs from
my favorite show Nashville.

26
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,490
You can see how you table
views are in IOS apps.

27
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,390
This action button on the right takes me
to the song that's currently playing.

28
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,573
Once in the player, this action
button brings up a with album info.

29
00:01:31,573 --> 00:01:33,590
Have a close look the nav bar.

30
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,710
The back button and
the title are standard.

31
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,050
They're always there.

32
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,260
The action button on
the right is optional, but

33
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,880
something you'll see frequently.

34
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,200
How does the app know where to go,
when the back button is pressed?

35
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,760
When we drill past a page of content,
where does it go?

36
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,710
In other words,

37
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,900
what kind of state is being managed
by this navigation controller?

38
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,940
We have to figure all of this out.
