00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,640
In this diagram there are two external states. There's an idle state and

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,550
a maintenance state. And there's transitions between the two indicating

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:13,350
the lines at the top of the screen. The maintenance state itself has sub-state

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:19,630
machines separated by the horizontal dash line. These two machines,

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,070
one called testing and one called commanding, are running concurrently. Each of

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,050
them as a simple machine starting at, at its left in the initial state and

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,320
moving towards right. And the commanding machine has a back loop from

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,700
its command state to its rating state indicating that, that particular machine

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,980
can execute several times before finally getting to its final state.
