00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Narrator] To understand the beauty

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
of a policy, let me look into stochastic environments,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and let me try to apply conventional planning.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Consider the same grid I just gave you,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and let's assume there's a discrete start state,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the one over here, and we wish to find

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
an action sequence that leads us to

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the goal state over here.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In conventional planning we would create a tree.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In C1, we're given 4 action choices,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
north, south, west, and east.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
However, the outcome of those choices

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
is not deterministic

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So rather than having a single outcome,

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
nature will choose for us the actual outcome.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
In the case of going north, for example,

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
we may find ourselves in B1,

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
or back into C1.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Similarly for going south, we might find

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
ourselves in C1, or back in C2, and so on.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This tree has a number of problems.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The first problem is the branching factor.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
While we have 4 different action choices,

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
nature will give us up to 3 different outcomes

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
which makes up to 12 different things we have to follow.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now in conventional planning we might have to follow just 1 of those,

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
but here we might have to follow up to 3 of those things.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So every time we plan a step ahead,

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
we might have to increase the breadth of

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the search of tree by at least a factor of 3.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So one of the problem is the branching

32
00:01:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
factor is too large.
