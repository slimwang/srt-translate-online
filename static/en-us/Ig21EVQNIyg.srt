00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,234
There are two facts about the human brain that are pretty mind-blowing. First,

2
00:00:04,234 --> 00:00:10,060
our brain is about 25% of its adult size when we're born. On the other hand,

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,662
our bodies are only about 5% of the adult size when we're born. As humans, we

4
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:18,269
have really big brains. And this is both why we're helpless when we're born,

5
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:22,957
but also why we have such a capacity for learning. The brain isn't fully wired

6
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:26,058
at birth. We only have a few instincts when we're born, such as suckling which

7
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:30,134
is needed for feeding. So, we need experience to shape our brain, and that's

8
00:00:30,134 --> 00:00:34,680
exactly what experience does. It physically changes our brain. Now, the second

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,882
cool fact is, how many neurons grow inside of the brain of a fetus. During

10
00:00:39,882 --> 00:00:45,294
prenatal neural growth, new neurons grow at an amazing rate of 250,000 neurons

11
00:00:45,294 --> 00:00:51,248
per minute. And this is the during the final stage of fetal development. Now,

12
00:00:51,248 --> 00:00:55,216
this amazing rate of neural growth continues into the first 18 to 24 months of

13
00:00:55,216 --> 00:00:59,813
life. Now, even though our brain grows and changes throughout life due to

14
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:03,699
experiences such as learning or exercising, even eating different things, the

15
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:08,890
rate of change does slow over time. And just because we have all of these

16
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,999
neurons, it doesn't mean we necessarily use all of them.
