1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now, that we have the equations for the SIR model, compute the sum of rate of changes.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The rate of change of the number of susceptible persons plus the rate of change of the number

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
of infectious persons plus the rate of change of the number of recovered persons,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
then look at the result.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What do you learn from that result.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Do you learn from the result that an epidemic will develop or that no persons are lost or

7
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that everybody recovers eventually or that the number of infections per time stays constant.
