1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,570
This recipe has taken me
years to perfect, and

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,263
I think it's finally ready
to share with the world.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,091
I just published it in my brand new
cookbook, Cooking with @walterlatimer.

4
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:14,613
[NOISE] So, what is a cookbook?

5
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:17,632
Well, a cookbook is a way
of documenting recipes,

6
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:21,790
it helps us make sense of all the tools
and ingredients in the kitchen.

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,350
Without this documentation, I might have
everything I need to make a delicious

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,630
meal but I wouldn't have any
idea how to put it all together.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,640
Technical documentation exists for
a similar purpose.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,860
To help us make sense of code.

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,570
Without it,

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,450
developers, you included, won't know
how to use other people's code.

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,520
They might not even know how to run it.

14
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,910
I read documentation for
all my projects, including this one.

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,620
In the instructor notes, you can find
a link to the Read Me I created for

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,820
this course.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,500
There, you can find helpful
resources to help you along

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,460
as you work through this lesson.
