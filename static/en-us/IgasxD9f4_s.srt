00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,650
Before we get to our final quiz on simplification, it's time that I introduce a

2
00:00:03,662 --> 00:00:07,325
new, wonderful tool that's called MathQuill. MathQuill's going to help format

3
00:00:07,337 --> 00:00:10,925
our expressions that we write so they look really beautiful when you type them

4
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:14,500
in. That way you can make sure that what you're typing is really what you want

5
00:00:14,512 --> 00:00:18,200
to be typing. That the expression that you're writing is what you really want to

6
00:00:18,212 --> 00:00:22,406
be entering. This is mostly an issue when it comes to exponents since there's

7
00:00:22,418 --> 00:00:27,208
not an automatic exponent key on a keyboard. So, for example, if we want to type

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,287
x to the 6th, then the keys you need to hit are x, carrot, 6 Now, of course, in

9
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:35,513
order to make a carrot, you might need to type different things depending on

10
00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:39,993
what kind of keyboard you have. But you'll notice that when you type the carrot,

11
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:44,010
the cursor in the box will move up into the super script spot, and you'll be

12
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:48,084
able to type up here a little 6. It's pretty cool. Then, of course, if you want

13
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:52,083
to get out of the super script position and back to writing the rest of your

14
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:56,019
expression in the normal spot where you write numbers and variables, you need to

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,357
type in an arrow key to move back down.

16
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:02,025
So, if you wanted to type x squared y, you'd need to type x carrot 2. But then,

17
00:01:02,037 --> 00:01:05,839
to move from being up here to being back down here, you just use the arrow key.

18
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:09,469
And then, you can continue typing. Here are a few things for you to try out.

19
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:13,261
I've already, I've already given you some guidance on what to type for these

20
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:16,997
first two, and then I'd like you to figure it out for these last two. However,

21
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:21,520
it should be pretty easy to check if you're doing it right, because you want

22
00:01:21,532 --> 00:01:25,788
what's in the box to just look exactly like what's over here on the left. So,

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,833
just try these out.
