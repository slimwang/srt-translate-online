One could say a lot about the connection between classification and cognition.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,180
This is because classification is ubiquitous in cognition. You're driving a car

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,640
on the street, you see a friend driving his car, you look, take a look at

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,670
the car, and you see a Porsche. Classification. You're on a computer program,

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,240
the output is faulty. You look at the output, decide on the bug.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,440
You name the bug. Classification. You go to a doctor with certain signs and

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,190
symptoms, the doctor names a disease category, classification. The reason

8
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,660
classification is so ubiquitous is because it allows us to select actions.

9
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,440
Once the doctor knows what the disease category is, he can suggest a therapy.

10
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,260
Once you know what the bug is you can decide on a repair for

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,590
that bug. If action selection indeed is a very productive characterization

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,510
of intelligence then we can see why classification is central to cognition.
