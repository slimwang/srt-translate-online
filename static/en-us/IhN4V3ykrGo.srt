00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,710
Let's take a short digression and discuss why we're building a model.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,420
In fact, this is a very important question because the answer to

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,370
this will determine how we validate our models.

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,990
We have discussed various models that we've built and the ways we

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,340
can quantify the errors in terms of the loss function for each model.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,030
We've also encountered various ways to calculate the loss

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,990
function of each model.

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,890
We have seen that the choice of the loss of the risk function is dependent on

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,538
how we formulate the problem.

10
00:00:34,538 --> 00:00:39,050
In fact, we're free to choose our loss or risk function and

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:45,240
a choice of a loss or risk function can result in a well performing model.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,200
Now this choice is very dependent on the problem formulation.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,330
The problem formulation itself is in

14
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:59,220
turn dependent on this question of the purpose of the model itself.

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,610
In natural sciences, we often build very well behaved, sometimes linear and

16
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,860
first order in time, models with simplifying assumptions of the parameters.

17
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:15,350
In this case a good fit to the model parameters, often their point values,

18
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,920
is desired and we find the best fit of the parameters to the data.

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,560
This is often referred to in fields like economics and

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,270
many branches of engineering as the Model Identification Problem.

21
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:33,640
In statistical learning, we accomplish more than just identification.

22
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,030
We choose systems that are quite complex and

23
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:42,820
often models with many non-linearly correlated variables to describe them.

24
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,100
In this case, we want to recognize the patterns in the data,

25
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,650
to not only solve the identification problem, but

26
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:56,080
also to accurately predict such patterns for all possible future

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,560
data where the patterns are similar but not necessarily the same.

28
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,820
Validating a statistical or machine learning model does not

29
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,288
only requires us to validate the model on the data we have, but

30
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:15,800
also to hedge the model's prediction abilities with probabilistic bounds
