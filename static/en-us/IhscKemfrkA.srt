00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,906
Which way is up to you, the y or z axis?

2
00:00:02,906 --> 00:00:09,012
I mean when you're working on a workstation and your screen is vertical, then I think of it as y up but people

3
00:00:09,012 --> 00:00:13,160
working with pads now you sort of have this case where the z is coming out of

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,286
your pad, your tablet, because you're working in this direction.

5
00:00:17,286 --> 00:00:24,927
I would say, negative y Because that's how my old VGA card on my PC worked. For some reason

6
00:00:24,927 --> 00:00:29,746
the Y axis points downwards on them so when you started making the first 3D

7
00:00:29,746 --> 00:00:35,039
effect which was like, you know, the star scroller, you're like flying toward in

8
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,400
a some kind of galaxy with stars. You ended up with, you know, when you

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,103
increased Y the points were moving downwards. So I would say - negative y, that's up.

10
00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:49,279
For me, because I'm in a shop all the time, z is always up. And

11
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:53,420
then that has to do a lot with like CNC machining, you know. If I'm in the shop

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,190
it's always the Z, if you're doing 3D printing it's always the Z axis.
