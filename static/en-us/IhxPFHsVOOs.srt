The web is an extension of
our computing environment,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,740
because most of our daily tasks
involve interaction with the web.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,280
In this lesson,
we'll first reveal how the web works and

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,618
discuss its major threat vectors.

5
00:00:13,618 --> 00:00:18,060
We will then discuss several attacks,
including Cross Site Scripting,

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,570
Cross Site Request Forgery and
SQL Injection.
