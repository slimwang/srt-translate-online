1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,520
So let's see if we can
figure out a RAID 1 array.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,310
Suppose we have a RAID 1
array with two disks, and for

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,186
a single disk we have a 200GB capacity,

4
00:00:11,186 --> 00:00:17,180
10 MB per second throughput and
the MTTF of 100,000 hours.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:23,294
In that case, our two disk RAID 1 array
has a data capacity of how many GB,

6
00:00:23,294 --> 00:00:28,460
a throughput of how many MB per second,

7
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,350
assuming that we do equal
numbers of reads and writes, and

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,000
finally our MTTF is
equal to how many hours?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,720
And for this type of RAID,

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,250
we also need to know whether we
replace failed disks or not, so here,

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,130
assume that we do replace the failed
disk and that the mean time to repair,

12
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,390
meaning the mean time it takes us to
replace the failed disk, is 24 hours.
