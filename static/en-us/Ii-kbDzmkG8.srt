00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,547
What's happening in these two functions is something totally new for us. For

2
00:00:03,547 --> 00:00:07,323
each one, we get a value of x that's not allowed right in the middle of the

3
00:00:07,323 --> 00:00:14,228
domain. What does this actually mean? Well, here's the graph of one of the two

4
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:19,705
functions we were just working with f of x equals 1 over 3x. What do you notice

5
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:23,983
about the behavior of the graph just before x equals 0, so to the left of the y

6
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:29,710
axis and just after x equals 0, to the right of the y axis?
