Here's a different type of problem that we can solve using the Pythagorean

2
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:07,740
Theorem. A rectangle is three inches longer than it is wide. If the diagonal of

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,861
the rectangle is 15 inches long, what are the rectangle's length and width? Try

4
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:17,623
labeling this diagram with the appropriate expressions and then see if you can

5
00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:22,091
solve for the length and the width. When you're entering in the length, the

6
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:25,713
length will be the longer side or the longer dimension. And the width will be

7
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:27,830
the shorter one. Good luck here.
