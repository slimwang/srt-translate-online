1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,760
Let's specify the behavior
of our enemies.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,880
Each enemy will be associated with
a particular platform, and will

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,200
patrol the top of that platform, turning
around when it reaches one of the ends.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,210
Like that.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,600
The enemies also seem to be floating
on some kind of zero gravity, so

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,799
we'll have them bob up and
down as they move.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,390
Finally, we need to determine how
to make the enemies dangerous.

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,740
Now one option would be to have
GigaGal have a health meter, and

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,940
then subtract from that health
every time she hits an enemy.

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,409
I think it's more interesting though
if instead, every time GigaGal touches

11
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,810
an enemy she gets flung backwards,
possibly falling to her certain doom.
