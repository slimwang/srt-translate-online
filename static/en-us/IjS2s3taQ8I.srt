1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
So, Intel Inside® was a great example of joint business development.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,380
They managed to exchange advertising dollars

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,880
for a prominent position on the outside of computer manufacturer's boxes.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,900
What computer manufacturers got in exchange

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,880
was gross margin that they never would have gotten in a low-margin business.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,240
Starbucks® and Pepsi™ to promote Frappuccino®

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,010
was a great example of a strategic alliance.

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,650
Apple and the record labels was another example

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,850
of a great strategic alliance, but Apple and Foxconn is a great example

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,800
of a supplier and might, at times, actually be a good example

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,950
of a joint venture as well.

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,280
Fashion week, well that's an example of coopetition.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,190
Normally, at other times of the year, these high-end clothing manufacturers

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,460
compete with each other vociferously,

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,200
but once a year they get together and cooperate in grading the industry.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,600
Standards groups are another example where competitors get together,

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,800
put aside their differences, and work together towards a common goal

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,160
of trying to come up with a set of mutually agreed standards.

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,930
Kind of the ringer in here, that is the one that I didn't describe,

20
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,970
but all you had to do was go on Google,

21
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,070
is the most famous aircraft partnership ever made

22
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,480
where 2 of the most unlikely partners, GE and a French aircraft manufacturer,

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,420
came together to do a joint venture for the CFM-56 jet engine,

24
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,420
which is one of the most popular turbofans in the world,

25
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,140
so that was a great example of a joint venture

26
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,150
and also had a bit of coopetition in it as well.

27
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,610
Finally, for traffic partners.

28
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:42,970
If you think about all the online scheduling sites, KAYAK, Expedia, Hipmunk,

29
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,310
they're all traffic partners for the airline industry.

30
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,060
In fact, that's how they make their money.

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,950
While you're having a great time figuring out multiple airline schedules,

32
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,310
every time you click through to by a ticket,

33
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,810
they are getting paid by the airlines, and that's how they make their money.

34
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,060
So, I hope these were good examples to help you understand

35
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,220
the different types of relationships.

36
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,290
As I said, sometimes they kind of blur between each other.

37
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,310
Sometimes it might start with coopetition and turn into a strategic alliance

38
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,420
and someday might actually be a joint venture,

39
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,690
but the whole idea is that you're working together with others

40
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,840
to help build your company.
