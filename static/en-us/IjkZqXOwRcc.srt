00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,370
In the diagram, we have the master controller invoking the inputs and outputs.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,590
But the other communication is based upon more or

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,720
less a need to know when the output needs some value,

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,770
to be produced it looks to it's source which is the alphabetic.

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,520
Alphabetizer or the alphabetized shift component.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,010
And it looks to the circular shift component,

7
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:32,250
which looks to the information that was stored during the parsing process.
