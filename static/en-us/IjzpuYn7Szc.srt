1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And the answer is just 5.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If you look carefully for K=1,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
this guy will be mis-classified.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's closer to a plus than a minus.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Similarly, for K=3, this guy has 2 nearby pluses and 1 minus,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
so it would be positive.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
For K=5, to get the correct answer,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the 5 nearest neighbors of this guy are

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
those 3 minuses plus perhaps those 2 pluses over here.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This guy has in his 5 neighborhood

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
these 3 pluses over here, plus a minus, plus a plus.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This data point over here has 2 pluses with 3 of the surrounding minuses,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and they are all classified correctly.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
For K=7, this minus data point will have

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
4 pluses, 3 minuses over here,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and then everything in the vicinity becomes positive,

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
so it must be 4 plus and it will be mis-classified.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The same is true for K=9.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The minus over here will have 1, 2, 3 minuses,

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
5 pluses, and the minus over here,

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
which makes 4 minuses.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It will be classified as positive.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So K=5 would have been the only correct answer.
