1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's going to turn out that there are 8.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There's the global frame. There's our call factorial 6.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There's factorial 5, 4......1, and in fact, if you look carefully--this was a bit of a trick--

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
at our termination condition for this recursive procedure,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
we actually call in here when n is 0.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, if we include the global frame.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And how many of those will n have the same value?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
None of them. It's 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and undefined.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's never the same.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We're honestly doing different computation going through different values.
