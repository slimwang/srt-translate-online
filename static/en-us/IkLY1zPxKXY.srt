00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,950
Now let's do a quiz on ESP and.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,980
Label each statement T for
true or F for false.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,610
First, ESP can provide
both confidentiality and

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,270
integrity protection.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,164
Second, if the authentication
option of ESP is chosen,

6
00:00:16,164 --> 00:00:20,070
message integrity code is
computed before encryption.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,399
Third, to protect the confidentiality
and integrity of the whole original

8
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:30,930
IP packet, we can use ESP with
authentication option in tunnel mode.

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,210
Fourth, in The integrity
hash covers the IP header.
