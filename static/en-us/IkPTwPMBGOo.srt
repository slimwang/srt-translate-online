1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,255
We know that according to the
Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm,

2
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:11,255
you is alpha which is 5 raised to
the power of xa which is 6 mod

3
00:00:11,255 --> 00:00:12,668
q which is 23.

4
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:15,140
And the result is 8.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,315
Likewise, yb is alpha which is 5 raised

6
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:26,721
to the power of xb which
is 15 mod q which is 23.

7
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:29,324
And the result is 19
