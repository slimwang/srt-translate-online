1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is all of these are shifted to the right.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The 1/9 in the left-most cell goes over here, the 1/3 over here,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and finally the right-most 1/9 finds itself on the left side.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the case of exact motion, we have a perfect robot.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We just shift the probabilities by the actual robot motion.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, that's a degenerate case. Let's program this one.
