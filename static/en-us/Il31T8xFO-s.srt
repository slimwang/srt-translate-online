1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,260
So now I'm going to look at the code
that I added to implement the scrolling

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,586
list of all the dinners.

3
00:00:05,586 --> 00:00:11,764
So the first thing I'm going to do is in
the com.example.android.dinner package,

4
00:00:11,764 --> 00:00:16,730
I'm going to add a new Java class
called ShowAllDinnersActivity.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,622
This class extends ListActivity.

6
00:00:19,622 --> 00:00:22,129
It knows how to get a list
of all the dinners.

7
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:25,753
It uses an adapter to display
all the dinners in the list, and

8
00:00:25,753 --> 00:00:29,732
it defines the onListItemClick, so
that when an item on the list is

9
00:00:29,732 --> 00:00:33,641
clicked we send an intent to start
the OrderDinnerActivity, and

10
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:35,662
passing in the selectedDinner.

11
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:42,220
Now over, in Main Activity, we add the
showDinnerList method, which is going to

12
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:48,100
be invoked whenever somebody clicks on
the show me all the dinners button.

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,301
And all this method does,

14
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:52,800
is it sends an intent to start
the ShowAllDinnersActivity.

15
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,260
So that's it for the code, but
now we need to do the layouts.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,290
The first thing I'm going to do is
add the button to the main screen,

17
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,360
to list all the dinners.

18
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,090
And there it is, show all the dinners.

19
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,790
But I'm not done with the layout yet.

20
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,340
I need to add
the listalldinners.xml file,

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,770
which is a list of all the dinners.

22
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,630
So we need to add
the showdinnerinrow.xml layout file,

23
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,630
which is a layout for
each dinner entry in the list.

24
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,730
All right, that should do it.

25
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,443
So, I'm going to redeploy my app and

26
00:01:29,443 --> 00:01:31,640
hopefully we'll see
the changes in the UI.

27
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,010
So of course, one more thing you
need to do in the code is to update

28
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:43,130
the AndroidManifest.xml to include your
new class, ShowAllDinnersActivity.

29
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,180
If you don't do this, it It won't work.

30
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,478
So that's all there is to it.

31
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:52,600
Now I'm going to run my app again,
and let's see if it works.

32
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,260
So, I press my Show All the Dinners,
and let's see.

33
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,300
Oh, and there's my list of dinners.

34
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,800
Cool.
