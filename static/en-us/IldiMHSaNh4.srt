1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,270
You actually did
an interesting experiment.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,910
Can you share something
about that with us?

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,890
>> Well, we called it the lessons
of the Kobayashi Maru

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,970
which is a Star Trek reference for
our audience.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:18,114
In the Star Trek episode, it was
an unwinnable exercise and young cadet,

6
00:00:18,114 --> 00:00:24,376
James T Kirk, was forced, or chose,
to cheat on an unwinnable scenario.

7
00:00:24,376 --> 00:00:29,250
And he reprogrammed the computer, and
was able to succeed in that exercise.

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,580
So, we want to put students
in a similar scenario,

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,590
with the intent of deliberately forcing
them to take on adversary mindset.

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,410
And mind you, the people that we
did this were government employees

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,120
that typically work nine to five.

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,710
And they don't have this mindset.

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,750
But they embraced it.

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,570
What we asked them to
do was to take a test.

15
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,390
We gave them very little notice, and
we told them the night before too, and

16
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,090
that they were expected
to cheat on the test.

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,210
And if they were caught cheating,
then they failed.

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,270
They weren't supposed to study.

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,990
>> Okay, so cheating was allowed.

20
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:10,140
>> Cheating was expected, and the test
itself was the first 100 digits of pi.

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,740
So they had to recite
the first 100 digits of pi or

22
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,440
actually write them down.

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,160
It actually worked out really well.

24
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,930
I'll give you a couple of
examples of their creativity.

25
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,820
One of them created business cards,
well actually had a stack, and

26
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,790
came up the next day before the test and

27
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,540
was very proudly giving
us their business card.

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,820
The rest of the stack, it turned out,
had the answer written on them.

29
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,490
So this individual could have
walked around in front of us and

30
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,220
given one to every single student,
and given them all the answer.

31
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,120
He chose not to, but he could have
because he subverted our trust.

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,020
Another example was someone who,
we allowed students to have soda

33
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,220
cans on their desk and
they printed out the answer.

34
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,963
And put in on the side of the can and

35
00:01:52,963 --> 00:01:56,887
when we would walk around, they would
put their hand over the answers, and

36
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:59,459
then check the answers
when our back was turned.

37
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:04,404
And my personal favorite was a student
who would take one of the books

38
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:07,700
from the course,
scanned in the back cover,

39
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,340
loaded it in Photoshop,
and ghosted in the answer.

40
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,760
Printed it out, trimmed it down and

41
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,070
used hairspray to tack it lightly
to the back cover of the book.

42
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,580
It was indistinguishable unless
you closely looked at it.

43
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,874
So they created a whole
entire false book cover.

44
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:26,950
But that's exactly what
we are looking for.

45
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,470
We wanted people to
think like an adversary.

46
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,030
It really comes down to trust.

47
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,770
Where do you place trust?

48
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,130
Find those trust assumptions and
subvert.

49
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,990
>> So in this case the proctor was
the security system in some sense.

50
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,060
So you were proctoring all this time
when they were taking the test?

51
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,130
>> Yeah, so during the test,
my colleague and I were proctoring it.

52
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,110
And what was very funny, and granted,

53
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,751
we weren't trying too hard
to catch them cheating.

54
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:57,359
As we'd walk around the classroom,
in front of us, we'd see the students

55
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:01,235
staring up into the sky considering
the 73rd digit of pi, and

56
00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:03,376
behind us, we'd hear rustling.

57
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:07,400
And then I'd slowly turn,
behind me were students

58
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,380
contemplating the 67th digit of pi,
the 82nd digit of pi.

59
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,730
And then behind me I'd
start hearing rustling.

60
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:20,410
But it was really a good deal of fun,
they embraced it I mean, I could go on.

61
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,120
It was just,
the innovation was off the scale.

62
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,610
But I felt it was a useful and
fun exercise.

63
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,800
>> Absolutely.

64
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,750
I think security we say is all about
our assumptions and guarantees.

65
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,650
And assumptions have to be about
the nature of the threat you're going to

66
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,340
be dealing with.
