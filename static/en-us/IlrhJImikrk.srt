1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,050
Even though the algorithm
we just discussed for

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,650
a minimum vertex cover was very simple,

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,490
it illustrates some key ideas found
in many approximation schemes.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,000
Consider this figure here,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,900
illustrating the possible sizes
of the minimum set cover.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,740
We have the size of the set
returned by our algorithm here, and

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,730
the size of the optimum one here.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,550
And we would like to be
able to find some guarantee

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,110
about the relationship between the two.

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:31,180
The trouble, of course,
is that we don't know the optimum value.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,400
Actually, finding the optimum
value is NP complete,

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,050
and that's why we're searching for
an approximation algorithm anyway.

13
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,760
We resolve this dilemma
by finding a lower bound

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,940
on the size of the optimal cover.

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,950
That's the role played by the maximal
matching that the algorithm finds.

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,280
And then we find an upper bound
on our approximation then,

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,080
in terms of this lower bound.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,920
The cover that we returned has sized
twice that of the maximal matching.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,000
Note that the approximation does not
tell us enough about the optimum value

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,150
to allow us to solve the decision
version of the problem.

21
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,960
Does the graph have a vertex
cover of some particular size?

22
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,740
Our algorithm might be twice the optimum
value, as in these two graphs here,

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,690
or it might find an exact solution,
as in this case here.

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,440
So you can't tell what
situation we're in.

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,350
We can't tell where the actual
minimum vertex falls.
