00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,847
I always need to use a table when I'm solving rational inequalities and

2
00:00:03,847 --> 00:00:08,037
quadratic ones for that matter, so here is my filled out table. Now I can just

3
00:00:08,037 --> 00:00:12,132
read off which of these regions contains x values that make this fraction or

4
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:16,609
this rational expression negative. So that's just this first reqion, which is x

5
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:21,180
is less than two, and the second region x is greater than 3. [inaudible] Since

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,779
on a number line these two regions do not overlap, we have to use an or since no

7
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:30,516
value of x can fall inside both regions. So the solution is, x is less than 2 or

8
00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:35,157
x is greater than 3. Let's take a second to think about how we could visualize

9
00:00:35,157 --> 00:00:39,801
this inequality using graphs. So here I've plotted 2 Equations. I plotted Y

10
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:44,715
equals negative 16 X plus 48, over the quantity 3 minus 6, and the purple line

11
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:49,172
is just the line Y equals 0. The X axis. We want to know according to our

12
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:54,336
inequality when this line, the pink one, lies underneath the purple one. We want

13
00:00:54,336 --> 00:00:58,890
to know when the Y values of this curve drop below this curve. So we can see

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,774
that, that's every part that's going to happen for all X values except for those

15
00:01:03,774 --> 00:01:08,141
in the very small portion of the curve that's up here. We can see that this

16
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:12,604
matches the solution we came up with. This curve lies below this one, anywhere

17
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:16,689
beyond this point, where x is equal to 3. And anywhere in this part of the

18
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:21,348
graph. This line right here that represents the disconnect between these 2

19
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:26,394
portions of the pink graph. Goes straight through the .20. And, in fact, this is

20
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:31,184
the line, x equals 2. We can see that the entire part of the pink graph that's

21
00:01:31,184 --> 00:01:35,972
to the left of this, or that has x values less than 2, is underneath the purple

22
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:38,738
curve. So this fits what we found. Awesome.
