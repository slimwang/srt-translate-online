>> In this case, the mode is less than the median, is less than the mean. If you

2
00:00:04,918 --> 00:00:09,956
got this, great job. This was a really difficult question, so don't beat

3
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:15,276
yourself up if you didn't get it. Let's analyze this. We can tell that the mode

4
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:20,548
is here, in this bin. Now, since this distribution is skewed, these values out

5
00:00:20,548 --> 00:00:26,042
here will pull the mean more than the median. So, that means the mean will be

6
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:30,605
maybe somewhere around there, but the median should be less.
