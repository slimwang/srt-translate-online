00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So, here is another data set.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We have the sizes in square feet listed on the left,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and the corresponding prices in dollars listed on the right.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and I want you to look at the data.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Particularly I want you to tell me is there a fixed dollar amount per square foot?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,654
Yes or no?
