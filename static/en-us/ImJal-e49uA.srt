1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:06,220
Let's talk about how we human
characterize and describe earthquakes.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,710
Earthquakes occur everyday,
all over the world.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,934
The result of the energy being
released through seismic activity,

4
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:18,453
which can be caused by tectonic plate
movement, volcanic activity, or

5
00:00:18,453 --> 00:00:22,546
even advanced like meteor impact or
nuclear weapon that nation.

6
00:00:22,546 --> 00:00:26,746
Earthquakes can be described
in terms of their magnitude,

7
00:00:26,746 --> 00:00:30,370
epicenter, depth, date, and so on.

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,210
We might want to display some
of these properties in our app.

9
00:00:34,227 --> 00:00:36,606
All right, taking a quick glance
around the USGS homepage.

10
00:00:36,606 --> 00:00:41,005
It looks like a lot of
the information that we want is here.

11
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:42,745
Let's check out an earthquake
to see what we got.

12
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:44,545
This looks good.

13
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,335
We've got maps, we've got time.

14
00:00:47,335 --> 00:00:52,000
You've got near by places,
descriptions of location.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,018
Magnitude up here, looking good.

16
00:00:55,018 --> 00:00:58,012
All right, let's back up and see if
we can find any developer oriented

17
00:00:58,012 --> 00:00:59,550
information that we can work with.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,030
All right, if I scroll down here's
a link for real time feeds and

19
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,379
notifications.

20
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,360
Let's see what we get in here.

21
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,250
Looks like there's a lot of useful
ways to consume the USGS earthquake

22
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:11,879
data here.

23
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,960
ATOM syndication is used for
feed readers,

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,134
this earthquake notification
service can send you an email or

25
00:01:20,134 --> 00:01:23,280
cellphone alert when
earthquake's happen.

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,986
Use Google Earth KML to visualize
earthquakes around the globe right

27
00:01:27,986 --> 00:01:29,533
within Google Earth.

28
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:34,210
We got access to Tweeter,
Spreadsheet Format and QuakeML.

29
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,640
Let's take a look at
the Spreadsheet Format for a minute.

30
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,170
So looks like this page has a good
description of the Spreadsheet Format

31
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,420
including the types of field
that we would build access.

32
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,339
And in fact, there's a little screenshot
here, that shows what it would look

33
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:55,781
like if you imported this into Excel or
Google Sheets.

34
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:58,993
And you can see right at the top,
we got headings for

35
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:03,770
Time, Latitude,Longitude,
Debt, and Mag for magnitude.

36
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,682
And we can see what the data format
looks like this was like a timestamp,

37
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:12,050
latitude and longitude or
numbers and depth is a number,

38
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,880
magnitude is a number so good.

39
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,830
We have some information
to work with here.

40
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,395
It looks like the USGS earthquake
data is structured in a way that we

41
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:23,060
might find useful for our app.
