00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,210
Great.
Now you've learned all about

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,590
monetization strategies and seen how
to submit any game to an App store.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,770
>> We talked about how important it is
to start thinking about monetization

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,820
early on and went to with
the best design strategies for

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,000
finalizing your game.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,180
>> Yeah, like how your game's appearance
in the App store can help it stand out

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,330
And how it's okay not to have
the perfect game before you launch it.

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,830
>> The important thing was to have
a strong game foundation, and

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,150
then make changes as you go along
based on the player feedback.

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,950
>> And you can get that feedback
directly from reviews or

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,980
from analyzing and
testing a game in real time.

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,740
Taking what you have learned in this
course, you now have a leg up on many

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,090
developers who leave monetization
strategies just as an after thought.

14
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,690
>> Congrats on finishing this course.

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,090
>> Time to get working on a new game.
