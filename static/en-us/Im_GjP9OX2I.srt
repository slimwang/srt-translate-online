1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,520
So, this was one way that we could find the inverse function. First we switched

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,339
the values of x and y, and then we solve for y and replace that with f inverse

3
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:17,007
of x. Now there is a quicker way to find the inverse of a linear function. I

4
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:21,760
could jet list out what I did to x. First I multiplied x by 2, and then I took

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,536
that result and I added three. So, to undo these operations I would want to

6
00:00:27,536 --> 00:00:32,753
start with the results and do the inverse of this step. So, I start with the

7
00:00:32,753 --> 00:00:37,910
result, which is x, and I'm going to subtract 3 first. Then I'll take that

8
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,654
result and divide it by 2. Notice that to find the inverse function, we first

9
00:00:42,654 --> 00:00:47,600
undo the last step that we performed for f of x. Then we work backwards and

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,750
undo each of the steps before. We can see this for an input like x equals 1.

11
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,830
We'll multiply the input by 2, which equals 2, and then we'll add 3 to that

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:04,310
result, which equals positive 5. So, if this is a true inverse function. If I

13
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:10,474
put in positive 5, I should get out the original input which was 1. So notice,

14
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:16,088
we'll take 5, use that for the input of our inverse function. And first, we'll

15
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:21,720
subtract 3, which equals 2. Next, we'll divide that result by 2, so 2 divided

16
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,693
by 2, equals 1. So, notice how our inverse function undoes the operations that

17
00:01:27,693 --> 00:01:32,378
was performed on 1. Our original function with an input at 1 gave us an output

18
00:01:32,378 --> 00:01:37,596
of 5. And then our inverse function with an input of 5 gave us our original

19
00:01:37,596 --> 00:01:40,090
input which was 1.
