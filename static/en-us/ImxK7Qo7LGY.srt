00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,790
Now before we dive deeper into the algorithms, I want to make one important point.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,090
When you use randomness in computation, there is sometimes a danger of taking the poking around

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,910
that I mentioned in my topic before this unit a bit too literally.

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,000
So some people when they see an NP complete problem or an NP hard problem

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,020
and NP complete of course being for the decision problem and NP hard for the optimization problem,

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,180
just terminology means both problems are hard.

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,439
And then some people would just say--oh this is NP complete and this is NP hard,

8
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,500
well let's just try very, very many random solutions and pick the best one,

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,860
which of course works better if you have an optimization problem than a decision problem,

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,160
trying many random solutions sounds easy, actually it is easy,

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,890
and you trust that the solution that it produces will be good enough.

12
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,330
Well, sometimes you have no better choice than that,

13
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,360
but in my mind I think you're playing a dangerous game and I want to illustrate this for you.

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,790
So let's say that we play a game and the rules of the game are as follows--

15
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:05,880
you bet an amount x whatever you want and then you throw a die and of course, the value

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:13,560
can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, and if you throw a number between 1 and 5, I will give you back

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,410
x+30% of x, and if you throw a 6, I'll give you back 0.

18
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,400
Now my first quiz for you and again this involves a bit probabilities should you play this game,

19
00:01:23,400 --> 99:59:59,999
and let's say you can play as often as you want--
