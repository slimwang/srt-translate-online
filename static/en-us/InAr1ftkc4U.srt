1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,550
Let's start off with the domain. Our lowest x coordinate of any point on the

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,960
green curve is over here at negative 8. And we can see that this dot is filled

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,435
in, so we need an inclusive bracket there. The highest in x that we'd move is

4
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:17,950
over here but we have an open circle at x equals 9. Since we write a 9, but we

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,634
write an open bracket to show that 9 is not included. So, now for the range.

6
00:00:22,634 --> 00:00:27,595
Let's look at the graph from this direction, then. The smallest value for f of x

7
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:32,395
for any of the given inputs that are possible, in this function is -3, and that

8
00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:37,358
point is not included because of the open circle. The highest value for y is at

9
00:00:37,358 --> 00:00:43,745
y equals 9. So our range, then, goes from -3 to 9, not including negative 3, but

10
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:44,894
including 9.
