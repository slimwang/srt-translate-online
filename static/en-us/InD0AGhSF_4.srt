00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,876
>> Let's take a moment to examine these values of x, the amount we're increasing

2
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:09,740
each dimension by, and A, the total area of Grant's display space, or at least

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,742
the ones that we've seen so far. The original area, before we added anything to

4
00:00:14,742 --> 00:00:19,970
either dimension, was 150 square feet. When we added 1 foot in each direction,

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:25,513
the area changed 176 square feet. So in the transition from this point to this

6
00:00:25,513 --> 00:00:30,584
point, x went up by 1 and A went up by 26. Let's see what happens in the next

7
00:00:30,584 --> 00:00:36,195
transition. Once again, x went up by 1. But this time, A increased by 28 instead

8
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:41,494
of 26. This is what we call nonlinear behavior. Remember that for a straight

9
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:46,020
line, which we can write as y equals mx plus b, m, the slope, is going to be the

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,795
same, regardless of which points we pick. The change in x is always going to be

11
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:55,435
the same. The change in x value is always going to have the same proportion to

12
00:00:55,435 --> 00:01:00,076
change in y value. The change between two x values and the change between two y

13
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:04,357
values is always going to obey the same ratio. That is not what's happening

14
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:08,686
here. This equation no longer applies. A change of 1 foot in dimension doesn't

15
00:01:08,686 --> 00:01:12,787
always increase the area by the same amount. This is a pretty interesting

16
00:01:12,787 --> 00:01:17,353
problem to have. Remembering that area is equal to length times width, can you

17
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:21,826
come up with an equation that we can use to figure out what value of x will give

18
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:26,708
us an area of 300 square feet? So think about how x will be involved in both the

19
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:29,194
length and the width of this new area.
