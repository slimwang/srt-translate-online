00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,000
Following a few principles,
we make forms a breeze for your users.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,590
Which ultimately means
more conversions for you.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,410
One, make forms as short and
sweet as possible.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:17,590
Avoid making any redundant information
and auto-fill as much as possible.

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,723
Two, provide helpful prompts.

6
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,485
In the last lesson you did
it with the label elements.

7
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:27,807
Three, provide immediate feedback.

8
00:00:27,807 --> 00:00:31,604
Feedback comes in many different shapes.

9
00:00:31,604 --> 00:00:37,245
In the last lesson, you get feedback
on an input with an instant validation.

10
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:40,995
In this lesson, you'll use progress
bar to provide feedback on the users

11
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:42,818
progress through the entire form.

12
00:00:42,818 --> 00:00:43,554
You can learn about these principles and
more through the link in

13
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:45,836
