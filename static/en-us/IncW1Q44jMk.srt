1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,939
The area under this curve, is 1. Remember that when we have the proportions,

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:11,751
they all add to 1. Likewise, the area under the curve, is equal to the sum of

3
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:16,065
all the frequencies in all the bins, which should be 1.
