1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So now we've modified our get_next_target procedure,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and it will return None as the first output if there's no next target.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Otherwise it will return the URL and the end_quote.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And now all we have to do is figure out how to keep going.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's look at what we were doing before.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We turned these 4 lines into our procedure

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so now we can--instead of having all this code,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
we're going to call the get_next_target

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and assign the results.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now we've got the value of URL, which we do on a print out,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
so we're still going to print that out as before.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And we still want to update the value of page,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but we don't want to use end_quote now.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What we want to use is the value that was returned here,

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
which we assigned to the variable endpos.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And then, well, we're doing it all again.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So, all of the code here is just another call to get_next_target,

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and similarly, this would be endpos instead of end_quote.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And we want to keep going until we get to the end,

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
so how do we decide when we've gotten to the end?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, we got to the end when the URL

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
that's returned is None.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And when the call to get_next_target returns None for the URL,

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
we know we're done.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We've seen a way to keep going. That's a while loop.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We've seen a way to do a test.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We want to test the URL.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And we have everything we need now to print all the links on the page.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to give you a start for how to write this procedure,

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and then you're going to finish it.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What we're going to do is define a procedure

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
that will print all the links on the page,

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and it takes the page as input, and so we want to use a while loop to keep going,

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and I am going to leave blank the test condition for the while loop.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We'll leave that as something for you to figure out.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
In the body of the while loop, what we're going to call get_next_target,

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
assigning URL and endpos to the result.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is just like what we were doing in the example code.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Now what we need to do is check whether we got a valid URL,

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
so what we were doing here,

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
we assumed that we always got a valid URL,

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and we printed it out, and we kept going, but we need to do something to test

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
whether the URL that we got back is None.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's what we'll do.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We have if URL, and if that's true, that means we found a valid URL.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We didn't get the value None as the result from get_next_target.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And so we want to print that out as we were doing before.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We'll print the URL, and we'll advance the page

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
to the next position.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If we didn't get a valid URL,

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
that means that get_next_target did not find a link.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
There were no more links on the page,

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and we need to do something else, and I will leave blank

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
what we need to do here.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So, this is all we need for the code to print_all_links.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There are 2 parts left for you to do as the quiz here.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
See if you can figure out what should go as the test condition for the while

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and in the block for the else.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And if that's correct, you'll be able to print all the links on the page.
