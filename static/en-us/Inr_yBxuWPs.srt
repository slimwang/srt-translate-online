00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,110
So in the first of the series
of three lectures by Aaron,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,810
he talks about extrinsic
camera calibration.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:06,360
In this one,

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,130
basically, the goal is if you take
a series of pictures of an environment,

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,630
with a camera like this, we want to be
able to figure out, by those pictures,

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,960
what is actually the word model with
respect to where the pictures are.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,120
That is more of understanding where
this camera is in the real world,

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,770
with respect to anything
else in the environment.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,630
Again, remember when we talked about
photosynth we talked about the whole

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,420
concept of figuring out pictures
as they relate to each other.

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,720
What this process of camera calibration,
especially the extremes of calibration,

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,160
is aimed at locating the camera
in the 3-D world and

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,100
giving the position and
all the degrees of freedom of it.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,030
You'll be building on all the concepts
of homogenous coordinates and

15
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,310
the transformations that
we have looked at, and

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,460
actually will use some
of the similar notation.

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,870
Be warned, some of the notation that
Aaron uses is slightly different.

18
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,570
Pay attention to the concepts
in these lectures and

19
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,660
that's where the foundation
of this approach comes in.
