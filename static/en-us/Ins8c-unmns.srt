00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,110
Welcome to Lesson Four. You've done a lot so far.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,880
You created an app and a database, you added fields

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,410
and objects, and you connected them all with relationships. You

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,730
took the default UI and you modified it, created ports

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,250
and dashboards. Yeah, your app looks pretty snazzy right now,

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,510
but the underlying app just doesn't do quite enough yet.

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,870
Let's go back to the music festival with Samantha and

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,939
Andy and figure out what you need to do next.

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,320
>> So we've already talked a bit about

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,640
the planning and the business sides of the festival.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,130
>> But then there's actually running the festival.

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,600
>> Right, because in my experience, there's a ton of things

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,750
that can and do go wrong, that usually get fixed immediately.

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,800
>> Yeah, like at a festival, there could be

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,680
broken microphones, blown speakers. Bands might be running late.

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,740
>> Right. And ideally, the solution to

17
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,000
these problems would be as automated as possible.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,430
>> Yeah. And then

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,400
SalesForce, we would use things like workflows or

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,360
approval processes to solve these kinds of problems.
