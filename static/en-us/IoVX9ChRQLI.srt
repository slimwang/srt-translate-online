00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,830
Data and interoperability standards
are the virtually ubiquitous plumbing

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,540
that underly all contemporary health
informatic systems and tools.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,790
Given the complexity of health care,

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,740
it should not be surprising that
this is a complicated topic.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,210
In fact,
we're dividing it into two lessons.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,260
In Lesson 5A, we'll focus on how health
data is represented, Data Standards.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,670
In Lesson 5B on how it is packaged
into documents, transported,

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,559
and shared, Interoperability Standards.
