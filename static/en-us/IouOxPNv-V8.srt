1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,160
Let's revisit our To-do list.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,500
At this point,
you should be able to run the app and

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,220
see a GIF with a caption added in
the preview of your controller.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,290
For example, here's my roommate's dog,
Mia, patiently waiting for a treat.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,530
Notice that I can make
a GIF from this video, and

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,520
then I can add a caption and
I can see the caption in the preview.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,900
Sweet, add a caption, done.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,910
We can check that one off.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,130
All right, moving on to share the GIF.

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,009
Our share the gift task has fewer steps.

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,360
We just need to add the GIF to
an activity items array, and

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,480
then present options to share it
with an Activity View Controller.
