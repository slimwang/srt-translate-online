1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,425
Alright, let's do this.

2
00:00:01,425 --> 00:00:02,410
[INAUDIBLE]

3
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,130
new. Oh my goodness. Why does it want all this information, Sam?

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,600
>> In order to sign up for a free developer

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,240
account, you have to give them a little bit of

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,870
information. But giving them your e-mail, so that they can

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,000
send you the sign-up information to be able to log in.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,300
>> What if I didn't have a company? Could I just put none?

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,710
>> You could put none. But it's asking for some geographical location just to

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,250
send you information about cool events that might be coming up in your area.

11
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,350
>> What's the deal in here? Username,

12
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,340
is that different from my email?

13
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,700
>> The username can be the same as your email, but if you already have a

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,010
developer edition account or any account under that

15
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,990
email, it'll probably ask you for a new username.

16
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,000
>> Oh. Oh yeah. Whoops, I need a new one.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
>>

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,142
[LAUGH]

19
00:00:39,142 --> 00:00:42,010
>> Okay, so what should I do? Just

20
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,160
like Andy, can I just do like Andy@udacity.awesome? Yup.

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,860
>> All right. I may have actually used

22
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:51,396
this one already, too. Yup. Let's do andy@udacity.sweet. Okay.

23
00:00:51,396 --> 00:00:52,358
>> Awesome.

24
00:00:52,358 --> 00:00:53,323
>> No, sweet.

25
00:00:53,323 --> 00:00:53,323
>>

26
00:00:53,323 --> 00:00:54,610
[LAUGH]

27
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,420
So, the great thing about the developer edition account is, it's

28
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,650
free, it never expires, and it's your own little test environment

29
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,650
to build any sort of app that you might want to

30
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,190
in it. Okay. Says I should receive an email. Let's check.

31
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,040
>> So, click into that.

32
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,680
>> Okay.

33
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,970
>> Oh, so this one isn't actually the login email, but

34
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,280
they send this out automatically when you sign up. It gives

35
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,900
you some cool links to getting started and, you know, learning

36
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,690
about the platform if you're new to it, but the other one

37
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,070
is the actual log-in link.

38
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,528
>> There it is. Okay. Log-in confirmation. I'm not going to

39
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:30,250
read this. I'm going to click this. Okay. password, right. Alright.
