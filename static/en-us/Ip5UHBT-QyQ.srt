1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,960
In order to write messages for the app
to the database we'll first need to add

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,200
the firebase realtime database
dependency to our project.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,402
So here I am on the Add Firebase to
Your Android Project Guide on firebase's

4
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:13,951
website and
I've linked this in your notes.

5
00:00:13,952 --> 00:00:17,346
If you scroll down you can find
the list of available libraries for

6
00:00:17,346 --> 00:00:21,295
the different firebase services and
right here next to realtime database is

7
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:23,466
the library that I need for
the database.

8
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:27,109
These library version numbers change,
so it's good to get it from this site.

9
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:28,789
I'm going to go ahead and copy this, and

10
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:31,419
I'm going to add it here
to our dependency block.

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,560
Android Studio is smart enough to know
that we just changed the gradle file,

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,859
and so we'll need to re-sync.

13
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:37,609
So I'm going to Click Sync Now.

14
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:40,350
Okay, and just like that,
the new dependency is added.

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,200
So now I'm going to go over to our
Java files and open up MainActivity.

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,490
To be able to start using the database,
we'll need to use two classes for

17
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,950
the FirebaseDatabase API.

18
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,220
I'm going to go ahead and
add instance variables for both.

19
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,100
This first object is a fire
based database object.

20
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,160
This is the entry point for
our app to access the database.

21
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,169
Next, we have a database
reference object and

22
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,130
this object is called
mMessagesDatabaseReference.

23
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,600
A database reference object is a class
that references a specific part of

24
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,609
the database.

25
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,950
So, for example, this database reference
here is actually just going to be

26
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,740
referencing the messages
portion of the database.

27
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:15,589
Let's go ahead and set that up below.

28
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,770
In onCreate I'm going to go ahead and
instantiate these two objects.

29
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:19,349
We'll go ahead and

30
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:23,019
use FirebaseDatabase.getInstance
to get a instance of the class.

31
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:26,129
This again is just the main
access point for our database.

32
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,670
Then using this access point,

33
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,760
we're going to get a reference to
a specific part of the database.

34
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,130
This part of the code here is getting
me a reference to the root node.

35
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:37,679
And then here, I'm specifically saying
that I'm interested in the messages

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,770
portion of the database.
