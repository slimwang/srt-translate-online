1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,104
Since we're looking for something in the form X minus H squared on the right

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:08,325
hand side, the result that we need to add on over here is 16. Now of course if I

3
00:00:08,325 --> 00:00:12,412
add something to one side of the equation, I also have to add it to the other

4
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:16,564
side. Now as we can see from our work in the last quiz, after we add 16 to both

5
00:00:16,564 --> 00:00:20,785
sides We'll be one step away from writing this in the form that we were aiming

6
00:00:20,785 --> 00:00:24,978
tor. So I'd like you to do that step of adding 16 and then modify the right hand

7
00:00:24,978 --> 00:00:28,878
side of the equation so that we get our final equation in the form y minus k

8
00:00:28,878 --> 00:00:33,035
equals x minus h squared. Put the equation written that way in this box, with of

9
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:35,424
course the appropriate numbers plugged in.
