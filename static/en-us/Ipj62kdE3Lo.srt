1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,198
So now, this time using these exact values, let's calculate the confidence

2
00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:10,062
interval for the mean if the entire population of Klout users used the Bieber

3
00:00:10,062 --> 00:00:15,670
Tweeter. And just to refresh your memory, we took a sample of Bieber Tweeter

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:21,672
users of size 35 and found that their mean Klout score was 40. If we assume that

5
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:28,470
this mean score is one of the 95% that lies within 1.96 standard deviations from

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,959
the mean, then what's the range of possible values that the population mean

7
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:40,176
could be? And remember, this is the would be population mean if everyone used

8
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:45,276
the Bieber Tweeter. So, what's going to be your lower bound and what's going to

9
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:48,109
be your upper bound? Give it your best shot.
