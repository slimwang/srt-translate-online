1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,560
Well, I'm sold.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,650
Libraries are great.

3
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,440
There are certainly some
downsides to be aware of.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,662
By definition,
a library is reusable and generic.

5
00:00:08,662 --> 00:00:12,450
If it custom built for you app,
it would be easier to call it your code.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,300
That means that libraries may
include more than what you need and

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,940
bloat what could be a lean app, or
maybe not even cover the cases you need.

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,860
And of course,
libraries are built by developers and

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,610
that means there may be bugs,

10
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,620
architectures that don't work well with
your existing app, or trade-offs such as

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,100
quality versus memory consumption that
you might not be able to control.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,460
In addition,
not every library ages gracefully.

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,620
They may not be taking
advantages of the newest API's,

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,280
hampering your ability to build
the best user experience.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,760
Or they may have been
abandoned entirely,

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,810
leaving you stranded when
faced with an issue or a bug.

17
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,930
Goes to show picking the right library
might be the most important step.
