1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,490
Now in general and you might have come across one or more of these examples,

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,580
using randomness is of course quite important in Computer Science.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,090
You might've come across randomness, for example, in crytography

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,600
where randomness is in a way the only way to fully securely encode a message.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,930
You might've encountered randomness in something called symmetry breaking.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's say you walk down a hallway and somebody comes in your direction,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,770
and you're trying to get out of the way of that person but the moment that you get out of the way,

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,200
that person also tries to get out of the way in the same direction,

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,830
and so if you did not have random decisions, then you would almost certainly crash into each other.

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,610
And finally randomness is often used in simulations,

11
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,830
so when you do physics simulation or financial scenarios,

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,240
then of course, also randomness is something very, very useful.

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,540
Now, the difficulty with using randomness to solve NP complete problems is this,

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:56,330
in all of these examples here, being as random as possible is something rather desirable.

15
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,630
So in cryptography, you want perfect randomness because that gives you the most security.

16
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,440
Symmetry breaking works best if you have as much randomness as possible,

17
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,880
so that these two entities, say, will make completely independent decisions of each other.

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,370
And in simulation of course too, because the point of using randomness

19
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:17,410
in simulation is to simulate random processes, so you want to model that as good as possible.

20
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,940
Now for NP complete problems, this doesn't work because for NP complete problems,

21
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,800
we don't want perfect randomness.

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,690
What we are looking for is a needle in a haystack and finding a needle in a haystack

23
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,930
simply by poking it from a few random directions won't really help.

24
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,180
And that is why we need to direct our randomness.

25
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,580
Let's say, you use randomness in a very naive way to solve clique

26
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,690
and just assign all of the vertices, random values of 0 and 1.

27
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,050
Now let's say you're doing this for a graph with n vertices.

28
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,380
Well, actually I think you can answer this question if I give you four choices from which to choose.

29
00:01:53,380 --> 99:59:59,999
So is it 1/n²? Is it (1/2)^n? Is it 1/2 * n? or is it 2^n/n²?
