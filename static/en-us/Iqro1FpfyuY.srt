00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,220
There are several noteworthy features of this constraint.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,540
The first is the use of the implies keyword to denote logical implication,

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,320
which is just a way of saying the restriction is only true for children.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:16,910
It is equivalent to the use of the right right arrow in first order logic.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,170
The second feature is the, the OCL use of the right arrow,

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:31,520
this one with only one horizontal line. And that's used with collection classes.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,980
So in the case where there's a collection on the left hand side and you wish to,

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,946
access or make use of one of the built in operations in this case size,

9
00:00:42,946 --> 00:00:48,140
you can use this right arrow

10
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,850
to say you'd like to bring in the size operation on this particular collection

11
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,670
class. The other types of collections that we'll get to but

12
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,860
all of them have a size operation associated with it
