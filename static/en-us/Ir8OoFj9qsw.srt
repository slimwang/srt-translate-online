00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,960
Let us try a slightly more complicated exercise. This time, we have three

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,630
variables, A, B, and C. And here are the combinations of the truth values of A,

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:14,320
B, and C. Here on the right are two formulas. The first one says,

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,660
A and parenthesis B or C parenthesis closed.

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:26,262
The second says parenthesis A and B parenthesis closed or parenthesis A and

6
00:00:26,262 --> 00:00:31,670
C parenthesis closed. Please write down the truth values for these two formulas.
