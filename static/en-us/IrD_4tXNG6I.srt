1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,390
Since we talking about health
information, remember the BLP model was

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:09,950
talked about in the context of military
or intelligence setting where we have.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,720
We're going to see that
confidentially is the reason for

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,400
it, but information that's
classified and things like that.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,760
So this is an for the health care
environment that we're talking about.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,700
For health care, we actually have HIPAA,
that's the regulation.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,490
And HIPAA is
the Health Insurance Portability and

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,120
Accountability Act,
I think goes back to the mid-90s

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,490
when this was put in place to
protect patient privacy and so on.

10
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,720
This HIPAA requirement
is why hospitals must

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,110
have these policies for controlling
access to patient records and those

12
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,410
policies are often mandatory access
control nature that we're talking about.

13
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,090
Just because someone did data
entry about a patient record,

14
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,250
of course they create that file but

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,580
they don't have the discretion to decide
now who all they can share it with.

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,160
It's governed by the hospital's

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,460
policy on how patient
records should be accessed.

18
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,370
So that's what makes it mandatory.

19
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,130
So the answer here would be
HIPAA because we're talking

20
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,030
about patient records in
the hospital setting.
