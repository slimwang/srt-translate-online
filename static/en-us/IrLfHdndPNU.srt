00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,300
Let's try a second problem on motion. This time, we have a bus traveling 10

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,864
miles per hour slower than a passenger van. If the bus can travel 200 miles in

3
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:12,646
the same amount of time that the van can travel 240 miles, find the speed of

4
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:18,189
each vehicle. Now, we're not going to do this entire problem in one step. But

5
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:21,850
if you can, great. We're going to break this problem into steps just like we

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:27,268
did before. So we have a bus and we have a van. Which of these do you think

7
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:29,620
would be the best choice for our variable?
