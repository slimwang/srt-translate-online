00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,630
Okay so, classification learning. Before we get into the details of

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,620
that, I want to define a couple of terms. Because we're going to

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,890
be throwing these terms out all throughout the lessons. And I

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,710
want to make certain that we're all on the same page and we

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,060
mean the same thing. But we're returning to this again and

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,180
again and again. So, the first term I want to introduce is the

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,130
notion of instances. So, instances, or another way of thinking about them is

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,250
input. Those are vectors of valu, of attributes. That define

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,220
whatever your input space is. So they can be pictures,

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,420
and all the pixels that make up pictures like we've been

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:38,350
doing so far before. They can be credit score examples like

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,265
how much money I make, or how much money Michael makes.

13
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:43,930
>> [LAUGH]

14
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,760
How much money I wish I made, so on and so fourth. So

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,380
whatever your input value is, whatever it is you're using to describe the input,

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,070
whether it's pixels or its discrete values, those are

17
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,570
your instances, the set of things that you're looking

18
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,170
at. So you have instances, that's the set of

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,150
inputs that you have. And then what we're trying

20
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,530
to find is some kind of function And that

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,780
is the concept that we care about. And this

22
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,720
function actually maps inputs to outputs, so it takes

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,610
the instances, it maps them in this case to some

24
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,650
kind of output such as true or false. This is the,

25
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,520
the categories of things that we're worried about. And for most of

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,150
the conversation that we're going to be having, we're going to be thinking

27
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,140
about binary classification, just true and false. But the truth is, this

28
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,020
would work whether there were three outputs, as we did with

29
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,340
high school, college, or grad school, or whether there were 250 as

30
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,450
we were contemplating for ages. But the main thing here is the

31
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:42,640
concept, is the function that we care about that's going to map pictures,

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,300
for example, to true or false.

33
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,190
>> So okay, I get, I get the use of the word," instance", right?" Instance"

34
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,130
is just, like, a single thing that's out there. But I have an intuitive notion

35
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,600
of what a concept is. How does that relate to this more formal notion? Like,

36
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,130
can we connect this to, kind of, the intuitive notion of what a concept is?

37
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,200
>> I guess so. So a concept, I don't know. How

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,620
would you want to put that? So a concept is something That,

39
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,070
I mean were talking about is a notion of a

40
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,420
function, so what it means formally is that you have

41
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,950
some input, like a picture, and it immediately inputs maps

42
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,980
anything in that input space to some particular defined output

43
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,110
space, like true or false, or male or female, or

44
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,640
credit, credit worthy or not. Intuitively a concept is an

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,980
idea describes a set of things. OK, so we can

46
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,725
talk about maleness or femaleness. We can talk about short and

47
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:34,950
tall; we can talk about college students

48
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,390
and grad students. And so the concept is

49
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,260
the notion of what creditworthiness is, what

50
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,400
a male is, what a college student is.

51
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,990
>> Okay, I think I see that. So, so essentially if you want to think

52
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,390
of tallness, the concept of tallness, one way to define it is to say, Well in

53
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,480
general if you give me something I can tell you rather or not it's tall

54
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,520
so it's going to map those somethings to am I tall or not. True or false.

55
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,580
>> Right. Exactly and so

56
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,090
really when you think about any concept and we talk about

57
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,700
this in generally [UNKNOWN] is effectively a way of saying is

58
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,690
effectively a set of things. That are apart of that concept.

59
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,170
So, you can have a concept of a car and if I

60
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,820
gave you "cars" you would say these things are in it

61
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,400
and if I gave you "non-cars" you would say they are not.

62
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,200
And so a concept is, therefore by definition, a mapping between

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,580
objects in a world and membership in a set, which makes it

64
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:23,920
a function.

65
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,130
>> Okay, that makes sense.

66
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:25,720
>> Okay.
