1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:06,100
So the answer is yes,
but maybe, probably yes.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,350
This code uses UI kit
in a background queue.

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,770
Will this make the code
crash every single time?

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,120
No, and that's the bizarre
beauty of concurrent bugs.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,050
They are impossible to reproduce.

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,420
If you run this code ten times,
it will likely crash a few times, but

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,730
not always.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,680
Make sure you always use UI
kit code in the main queu, or

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,630
eventually you will have to face the
toughest bugs ever, concurrency bugs.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:38,820
How would you get the offending line
of code to run in the main queu?

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,560
We'll see how to do
this in the sample app.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,250
But in the meantime,
try to do it yourself.

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,490
Remember Inception, the movie,
dreams within dreams.
