00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For our second class problem in the final exam, we're going to talk a little bit more

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
about chaos theory especially in relation to the Lorenz Butterfly.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We have some system in a state defined by x, y, and z.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now the solution that we might get for this system depending on how we define

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
different parameters within the equations could look something like this.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm not very good at drawing in 3D but this should look something like the classic butterfly image

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
that Jorn showed you in the unit.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Remember that our solution has two wings. One over here and one over here.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Both spiraling outward.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We can plot how z, this coordinate, varies as a function of time.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And when we do this, we see a series of peaks that ascend and then descend

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and then reascend and so on and so forth.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This set of peaks of increasing height corresponds to spiraling outward along one wing.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And then as you jump down to a local minimum to stepping upward again over here

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
corresponding to the spiraling outward along this wing.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What we want to know is if we can predict the progression

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
of this local maxima along the z axis.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You can make a plot of the current local maximum of z

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
versus the previous local maximum and then take each of these maxima and plot them down here.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So here's a preview of what you should get as your solution to this problem.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Up here we can see how the peaks in z vary with time.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Clearly, these zigzags are a little bit more accurate than mine were.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And down here we see how the present local maximum depends on the previous local maximum.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You'll know that you've gotten the problem right if something like this appears.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now in order to plot each local maximum we do in fact need to know

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the exact z coordinate of that maximum.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
One issue that we have when using approximation methods, however,

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
is that sometimes our time steps are not going to line up exactly with the locations of the peaks.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So if you look at this visual for example at step-1 we have this value of z.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
At step, we have this value.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And after one more time step, we've passed over the peak and downwards again.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We plotted this on its own completely ignoring where the actual peak is

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and shows instead it's substantially lower.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
In order to approximate better where this actual peak is,

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
we can pretend that there is a parabola connecting these three different points.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The vertex of the parabola will be our estimate for where the true location of the peak is.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
To find out the t coordinate of the peak, you can just simply use the quadratic formula.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Just a couple of hints for you. You want only one z value to be equals the maximum.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So think about what that means in terms of our equations down here.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Also, think about how you could use the essential difference formula

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
when you're discussing this local maxima.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Remember that one way to calculate a, b, and c is to plug in information

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
about the points that you know.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Then you'll have these coefficients and be able to find the proper value of z and t.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let's take a look at the code for a second.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Now the first thing that we want you to do for this problem is to use Heun's method, which you

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
remember from section 2.9, with a fixed step size and not a variable step size for the Lorenz system.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Remember that Heun's method depends on the forward Euler method

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
so we've included that for you right here.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So again just to be clear, use Heun's method with nonvariable step size to figure out how x, y, and z

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
are going to change with each time step.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Once you do this, you're going to use the parabola fitting method that I just discussed

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
to figure out better where the local maxima are.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Once you've done that, you're going to enter your estimate at the local maximum value.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This should be a fun look into chaos theory. Good luck.
