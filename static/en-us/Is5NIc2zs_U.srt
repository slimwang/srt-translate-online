00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,120
So this is the first input to web application, and the first entry in this tuple

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,210
is what's known as the regular expression. Now what a regular expression is, is

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,620
a compact way to describe a set of strings. And computer scientists often talk

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,749
about sets of strings as being a language. This is a bit of a misnomer since a

5
00:00:18,749 --> 00:00:21,998
language has not just a set of strings but a way to map those strings to

6
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:24,818
meaning. With a regular expression, all we're doing is defining a set of

7
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:29,170
strings. But regular expressions are a really interesting and powerful idea.

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,433
We're only going to touch this surface here.
