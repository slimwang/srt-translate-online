1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,060
And the answer of course,

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,310
is this one because I only have one sample in this node.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,040
Any of these other guys I can continue to split because they all

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,320
have more than two samples in them.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,490
So I can keep drawing my tree if I liked.

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,880
I can continue to keep going.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,540
Maybe to quite some depth.

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,280
Until I get a very complicated decision boundary.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,750
So you can see how once it starts to get really deep, really complex.

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,810
That's where you start to get some of these decision boundaries that do all

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,460
these complicated things.

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,130
And probably end up overfitting your data.
