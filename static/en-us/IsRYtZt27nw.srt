1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,880
So, how did the system know that 
the Maps app could handle this intent?

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,604
The activity within the Maps app
included an intent filter,

3
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,910
like this one, within its manifest entry.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,730
It indicates that the Maps app
is capable of performing

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,210
this view action on all data
which has a geo scheme.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,080
You can use intent filters
for your activities to define

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,960
the actions they're capable 
of performing, and optionally,

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,300
the kind of data that 
they can perform it on.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,024
So when you use 
an implicit intent to address

10
00:00:30,024 --> 00:00:33,060
or request to start an activity, 
much like you did with Catherine

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,480
and the openweathermap.org link, 
Android resolves this request

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,430
by checking the intent filters 
of every activity that's installed

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,490
on the device until it finds 
the best possible match.

14
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,790
If multiple activities match, 
as in the case with the web URL,

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,570
the user is given a choice.
