1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,199
And the answer is camera B and camera C.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:11,732
To see, we notice that the rightmost perceived feature in camera A's plane is called three.

3
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:14,966
So that's clearly the feature over here.

4
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:20,066
This feature over here will come on left in camera B.

5
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:25,166
It also comes in left in camera C.

6
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:30,066
But it won't come in left--it actually comes in right--in camera D.

7
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:33,333
So the answer is B and C, but not D.
