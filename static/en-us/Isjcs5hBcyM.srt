1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,074
Well, you see that in this confidence interval, for age and time you arrive at

2
00:00:04,074 --> 00:00:09,682
a party, the true correlation for the population could be 0. The confidence

3
00:00:09,682 --> 00:00:13,826
interval crosses 0. In this case, there's not enough evidence to reject the

4
00:00:13,826 --> 00:00:19,745
null. However, in this case, with age and number of pets. We're pretty sure

5
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:26,503
that the true correlation will not be 0. it'll be somewhere between point 0.14

6
00:00:26,503 --> 00:00:30,140
and point 0.57. Therefore, we would reject the null.
