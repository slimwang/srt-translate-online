1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,638
Determining what constitutes a mental illness can be a difficult task. Because

2
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:07,932
there's not a specific test, for example a blood test or an x-ray, that can

3
00:00:07,932 --> 00:00:13,176
tell us which disorder a person may have. However, over the past 200 years,

4
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:17,732
many industrialized countries have categorized psychological abnormalities

5
00:00:17,732 --> 00:00:23,805
using a medical model. The medical model is that conceptualization of

6
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:29,135
psychological abnormality as diseases. But like physical diseases have

7
00:00:29,135 --> 00:00:34,642
biological causes, defined symptoms and possible cures. Therefore the first

8
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:38,902
step to determining the nature of a problem is through diagnosis. Before

9
00:00:38,902 --> 00:00:43,118
discussing the process of diagnosing mental disorders, it's imperative to know

10
00:00:43,118 --> 00:00:47,210
that psychiatric labels can have negative consequences, including negative

11
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:54,052
stereotypes. Or stigma. In fact, some research has suggested that nearly 70% of

12
00:00:54,052 --> 00:01:00,500
people with a diagnosable psychological disorder do not seek treatment. We hope

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,280
that through this course we can educate you, as well as other students, in an

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,060
effort to help decrease a negative stigmatization associated with mental

15
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,229
illness.
