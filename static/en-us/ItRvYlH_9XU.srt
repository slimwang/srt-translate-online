1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,830
There's one last thing I want to
demonstrate with operators and

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:07,350
that's how the increment and
decrement operators affect assignment.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,955
We'll start by creating
a few variables and

4
00:00:09,955 --> 00:00:12,880
we'll also create a variable
that adds all of these together.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,550
So right now our total
pounds is equal to four.

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,910
Now if I use the increment or decrement
operator in front of a variable

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,170
then it's applied before any other
operators in this expression and

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,890
that includes the assignment operator.

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,390
So if we do ++poundsOfFlour,
then our total pounds is now

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,320
five because the increment is applied
before assignment and we can check to

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,810
see the new value of pounds of flour
which is two after being incremented.

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,520
Now if instead I move the increment or
decrement operator after the variable it

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,530
modifies, then it's applied after
the other operators in this expression.

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,380
And that again includes assignment.

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,840
So in this case we've put the increment
operator after pounds of flour.

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,145
And our total pounds is still
the original four pounds, but

17
00:00:57,145 --> 00:01:00,305
we can see that pounds of flour
has been incremented to two,

18
00:01:00,305 --> 00:01:04,084
it just happened after
the assignment of total pounds.

19
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:06,715
So you want to be extra careful
when you use these increment and

20
00:01:06,715 --> 00:01:09,635
decrement operators
because of this nuance.

21
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:11,465
So I'd encourage you
to take some time and

22
00:01:11,465 --> 00:01:14,945
play around with them in a playground
until you feel really comfortable.
