1
00:00:00,202 --> 00:00:02,650
All right, so we see that the code
with the single bracket and

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,410
a percent sign on either side
is the logical code that we

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,540
want to execute in our HTML,
like a for loop.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,600
The double brackets indicate the code
that we want it's results printed into

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,420
the html document itself.

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,590
Since, from within HTML codes,
we cannot use indentations to mark

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,220
the beginning and ending of statements
and loops, we must use keywords,

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,000
like endfor, and endif, to indicate
the end of a loop, or statement.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,510
Going back to my menu.html, I can
see how I'm obtaining the result of

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,510
a query and executing the output
here in my HTML page.

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,876
I will also need to substitute the code
I had in my restaurant menu method, so

12
00:00:36,876 --> 00:00:38,890
that instead of returning a string,

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,420
we will return a rendered template
with the new menu.html file.

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,040
Since I'm querying on my restaurant and
menu items table, I will path my queries

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,930
into the template, so that my escape
code has access to these variables.

16
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,000
I will also need to import
the render_template function from my

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,270
Flask library.

18
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,220
By saving and refreshing the page,
I see the same code with

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,480
a few stylistic modifications
I added inside of my template.

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,620
You'll be building your
own templates very soon.

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,510
I just want to talk about two more
topics to help you get the most out of

22
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,050
them first.
