00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,170
Congratulations, you just went
through a lot of content.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,268
You learned the concepts of binary
classification modeling and

3
00:00:07,268 --> 00:00:11,130
the backgrounds of logistic,
stepwise and decision tree models.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,370
What is just as important is
the ability to compare the models and

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,530
correctly choose which
model to use in production.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,310
Creating models is a lot of work.

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,780
But being able to give your boss
prediction results that you can trust is

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,900
definitely worth the effort.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,220
Now, we're going to take a very similar
approach to building non-binary

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,630
classification models
in the next lesson.

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,350
I'll see you over there.
