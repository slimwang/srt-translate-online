Here's a quote from Tony Wasserman about detail design.

00:00:08,357 --> 00:00:12,894
The primary activity during detail design, is designing the data structures that

4
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:16,457
are there and by implication the algorithms that are going to work on

5
00:00:16,457 --> 00:00:20,880
those data structures. As far as those algorithms are concerned,

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,620
sometimes you may wish to represent them using some kind of design notation.

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,810
Here are a few that have been used in the past in which you may have little

8
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:37,260
familiarity. Their pseudo code, which is like writing a programming language

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,910
algorithm without the programming language. There's structured programming,

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,950
which is a set of control structures,

11
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,470
which allow you to organize the algorithm into sequences,

12
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,670
conditions, repetition, and chunking in the form of calling subprocedures.

13
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,190
Flow charts and call graphs are graphic representations of programs,

14
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,760
that may be useful in helping you understand how that program is going to,

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,140
going to work. And in some cases decision tables, which are lists of rules and

16
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,390
the conditions under which those rules are going to apply,

17
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,170
can be useful in helping to understand complex situations.
