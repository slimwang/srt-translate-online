1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,608
First, we subtract 6 from both sides, so I'm left with negative 3 x, make sure t

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,298
carry the negative sign down with the term and negative 30 on the right. Here's

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,815
where I want to be careful. I'm dividing by a negative 3, the coefficient in

4
00:00:13,827 --> 00:00:18,291
front of x. When I divide by a negative, my in equality sign must flip over, or

5
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:22,996
reverse direction. So, x could be any number greater than or equal to 10. Just

6
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:27,447
like with equations, we can check to make sure if we are right. Let's plug in

7
00:00:27,459 --> 00:00:31,980
any number greater than or equal to 10 into our original inequality to see if

8
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:36,556
the condition is true. I'm going to plug in 10. And when I do that, I can see I

9
00:00:36,568 --> 00:00:41,089
get negative 24 is less than or equal to negative 24. That definitely checks.
