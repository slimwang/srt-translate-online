00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,630
In the situations where a database is involved and we have to be concerned about

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,660
transactions, that is making sure that the data that we store and

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,940
retrieve is consistent with respect to

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,600
the overall database we have to deal with transaction processing, and

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,300
in particular with what are called the ACID properties. The primary concern is

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,500
reliable database access, particularly when there are multiple readers and

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,450
writers. That is parts of the application reading from the database and

8
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,960
other parts writing into the database, particularly on in addressing

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,610
a particular, a specific record. Imagine that you were in a situation,

10
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,330
maybe you were doing airline reservations or something like that,

11
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:49,360
and you need to understand the information in the database, but

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,480
you may want to update it if you're making that reservation. Okay? So

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,860
you have to read it, examine it, change it, and then write it back.

14
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,720
What happens if another application changes the record after you've read it,

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,300
but before your change version has been written back. So we'd like to have

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,580
database transactions that satisfy the ACID properties, and ACID is an acronym.

17
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,730
The A stands for Atomic. That means that your transaction, these four steps,

18
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,430
reading, examining, changing, and written, are all treated by the system as if

19
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,142
they were one step with no intermittent activities going on. The C stands for

20
00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:31,430
consistency preserving, in the sense of database integrity. Okay. That is

21
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:37,230
if the database satisfied all its integrity constraints before your transaction,

22
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:43,230
it will also satisfy them after your transaction. Third, the letter I stands for

23
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:49,880
isolated. Okay, that, what that means is that other transactions can't see

24
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,650
into any intermediate states in the processing of your particular transaction.

25
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,880
And finally D stands for durable, and

26
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,120
that mean that once your transaction commits then it's persisted.

27
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,811
That means it, it is a permanent record that the system is aware of.
