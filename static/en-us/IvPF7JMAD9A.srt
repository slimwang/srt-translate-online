00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,365
Research on attraction shows that people find average and symmetrical faces

2
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:10,160
more attractive than less average, less symmetrical faces. Now, by average, I

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,020
don't mean common. I mean mathematically average. So, the size, shape, and

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,668
location of facial features have to be the mathematical average of a

5
00:00:18,668 --> 00:00:23,576
population. So, you can't have a face that's too big or too small, or eyes that

6
00:00:23,576 --> 00:00:28,594
are too close together or too far apart. Now, why is it that we prefer

7
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:33,733
symmetry? Well, symmetry can be an indicator of genetic fitness. That is, more

8
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:37,891
symmetrical faces can be a sign of less genetic mutations, and thus a sign of

9
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:40,420
good genetic health.
