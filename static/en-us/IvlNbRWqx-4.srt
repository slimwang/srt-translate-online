00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,971
So far, we have learned quite
a few tricks to design a layout.

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:07,450
Namely, putting stack views
inside other stack views.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,900
Changing the distribution algorithm.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,560
Changing the content hugging and

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,550
compression resistance
of individual views.

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,390
In this lesson, we'll put this to
use with some vertical layouts.

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,170
Once we're done,
we can put everything together, and

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,880
use auto-layout to create
any UI we might need.

9
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,829
In fact, we'll use it to
recreate a very well known UI.

10
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,029
But first let's check
these vertical layouts.
