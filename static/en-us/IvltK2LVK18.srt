00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,294
Let's keep solving equations. When we're doing that, we can add, we can

2
00:00:04,306 --> 00:00:08,877
subtract, we can multiply, we can divide, or we can even do other operations.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,651
But whatever we do, we have to keep one rule in mind. No matter what, we have to

4
00:00:13,663 --> 00:00:18,325
do the same operation to both sides of the equation. If we don't do this, we're

5
00:00:18,337 --> 00:00:22,940
going to change the initial relationship that we started out with between our

6
00:00:22,952 --> 00:00:28,122
quantities. And the answer we get in the end, won't work with that equation.

7
00:00:28,222 --> 00:00:32,289
Let's start out with a pretty simple example, x plus 3 equals 12. Then, I'm

8
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:36,582
going to draw two boxes down here, one for each side of the equation. And in

9
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:41,001
each box, I would like you to write what step you think should happen next, to

10
00:00:41,013 --> 00:00:45,096
change either side of our equation, so we can eventually get x by itself.

11
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:49,430
For now though, we're just going to write this one step in. So, for example, if

12
00:00:49,442 --> 00:00:53,625
you think that we should add 8 to the right-hand side, then write plus 8 in the

13
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,700
box on the right. Or if you think we should divide by 2 on the left-hand side,

14
00:00:57,797 --> 00:01:02,803
please write a slash and 2, to symbolize divide by 2. Please remember that if

15
00:01:02,815 --> 00:01:07,558
you want to symbolize multiplication, do not use an x, rather use the star

16
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,849
symbol and then, of course, whatever number you want.
