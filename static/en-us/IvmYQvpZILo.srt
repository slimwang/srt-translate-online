00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,880
Okay.
So you've got a time-line in place.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,420
And, now it's time for you to follow it.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,010
And this might seem a little asinine,
but

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,550
trust me,
it's a great learning experience.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,790
Even if your actual time to completion
is way off from your estimate, you'll

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,410
still have a better idea as a developer
how long it takes you to do things.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,016
There are great time-tracking apps,
like Toggl, for instance,

8
00:00:23,016 --> 00:00:26,900
that help you keep track of how long
it takes you to complete a given task.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,590
There's a link to Toggl
in the instructor notes,

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,170
if you want to check it out.

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,190
But maybe it's not your cup of tea,
and you have some other methods for

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,640
tracking your time.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,750
If you do, please share those thoughts
on the forums, because both myself and

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,670
your classmates would really
like to hear about them.
