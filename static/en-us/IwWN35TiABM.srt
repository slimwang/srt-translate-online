1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,820
Okay, so let's go through this.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,700
>> Good.
>> So let's look

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,140
at the outcome based estimate.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,400
>> Good.
>> I think you kind of gave me

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,525
everything I need here.

6
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:11,210
>> [LAUGH]
>> So-

7
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,440
>> Yeah, it's possible I spelled it out

8
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,470
too detailed.

9
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,750
>> You can never spell that
out in too detailed way.

10
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,460
So if I look at it,
we encounter S2 exactly once!

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,440
Exactly once.

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,370
>> And so
the average of one is pretty easy.

13
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,710
It's that thing.

14
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,470
>> Okay, and
what is the estimate for that one?

15
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,180
>> Well, 2 plus 0 plus 10 which is 12.

16
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,060
Because gamma's one.

17
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,825
>> Yeah.

18
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:33,975
Because gamma's one.

19
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:34,947
So, good.

20
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:38,676
So, this is saying, because we only ever
encountered S2 once and the one time

21
00:00:38,676 --> 00:00:42,565
that we saw it we ended up with a reward
of 12 getting to the final state.

22
00:00:42,565 --> 00:00:43,805
That's going to be our estimate.

23
00:00:43,805 --> 00:00:48,590
That's what TD one would actually
do moduled learning rate and

24
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,560
how you initialize the values and
so forth, but

25
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,200
that's sort of what it's trying
to be like given this data.

26
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,870
>> Right.

27
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,990
>> All right, so now, does that match
with the maximum likelihood estimate,

28
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,250
the estimate that we'd get if you
use the data to build a model and

29
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,430
then solved it?

30
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,910
>> So for
the maximum likelihood estimate,

31
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,176
>> All I really need to do is to

32
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:12,151
compute, let's see, the probability
from going from S3 to S4 and

33
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:15,771
the probability of going from S3 to S5.

34
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:18,298
Because everything else
is deterministic, and

35
00:01:18,298 --> 00:01:22,250
in all five of those transitions, I get
to see every state and every reward.

36
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,450
So I have everything that I need.

37
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,220
>> So let's just go ahead and
estimate the probability.

38
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,290
So looking it through I go
from S3 to S4 three times.

39
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,520
>> 2, 3 out of 5 times we're in S3,
good.

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,060
>> Right.

41
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,578
So that would be .6.

42
00:01:37,578 --> 00:01:39,240
3/5 is .6 yes, got it.

43
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,940
>> And by process of subtracting

44
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,570
that means that going from S3
to S5 happens .4 of the time.

45
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,650
Yeah.
And we could compute that directly too

46
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,690
by just counting,
we get twice out of five times.

47
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,694
>> So those aren't right.

48
00:01:58,694 --> 00:02:02,795
It should be 0.1 not 0.4, and
it should be 0.9 not 0.6, but hey,

49
00:02:02,795 --> 00:02:04,850
that's the data that we've got.

50
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,710
>> Yeah, you're right.

51
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,210
It's much more even, but
S4 is more common than S5.

52
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,008
Right.

53
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:11,680
Okay.
Good.

54
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,720
So with that I can just propagate
values backwards through the NDP,

55
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,830
just like we did on the final exam for
7641.

56
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:22,440
Okay.
So.

57
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,090
>> Good.

58
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,800
>> So let's see.

59
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,370
The value of SF is 0.

60
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,480
The value of S4 is 1.

61
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,870
1 more.

62
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,690
>> 1 plus 0.

63
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,900
And the value of S5 is 10.

64
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,270
>> Good.

65
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,630
>> Plus 0.
>> All right.

66
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,710
So, and that's all actually correct.

67
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,662
>> Yeah, that is actually correct.

68
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,136
Thank you determinism.

69
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:48,605
Okay.
[LAUGH] So S3 then.

70
00:02:48,605 --> 00:02:52,229
.6 of the time we'll get a value of 1,
and

71
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:55,110
.4 of the time we'll get a value of 10.

72
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,482
So that would be .6 plus 4.

73
00:02:58,482 --> 00:02:59,916
>> 4.6?

74
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,100
>> That is indeed 4.6.

75
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,290
Cool.
>> All right, so

76
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,420
who cares what S1 is but
I guess we can go ahead and compute it.

77
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,899
It would be 5.6.

78
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:08,424
>> Good.

79
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:11,050
>> because it's plus 1, 4.6.

80
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,530
>> But the actual question was about S2,
dun dun dun.

81
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,285
>> And so it is 6.6.

82
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:17,220
>> 6.6, all right.

83
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,593
>> Truth by addition
>> And it works out pretty well.

84
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:24,960
Okay, so 6.6 is very different from 12.

85
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,660
>> Sure.

86
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,410
I'm not sure either one of
them is right, so let's see.

87
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,826
If I recall when we went over this MVP
before using the actual transition

88
00:03:33,826 --> 00:03:35,899
probabilities, .9 and .1.

89
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:39,509
We figured out that
the value of S3 was 1.9?

90
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:40,148
>> Yep.

91
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:41,960
>> Yeah, and we can check that.

92
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,840
That would be 0.9 times
1 plus 0.1 times 10.

93
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,700
So yeah, that'd be 1.9, which means
the value of S2 would be 3.9.

94
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,120
>> All right, so the actual value's 3.9.

95
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,050
The maximum likelihood estimate is 6.6,
which is more.

96
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,163
But the outcome-based estimate is 12,
which is a lot more.

97
00:04:01,163 --> 00:04:06,275
Right, so
everybody's wrong except for 3.9.

98
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:08,860
But maximum likelihood
estimate is less wrong.

99
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,280
>> Right, and so why in this case?

100
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,390
What's the difference
between these cases?

101
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,830
First of all, why are these so far off?

102
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,430
And second of all,

103
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,010
why is the outcome-based one even
further off than the maximum likelihood?

104
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,790
>> Well,
I think itâ€™s pretty simple, right?

105
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,160
When we computed the outcome-based one,
we basically only used one of the five

106
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,715
trajectories to propagate
information back.

107
00:04:29,715 --> 00:04:30,320
>> Mm-hm.
>> But

108
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,180
when we did the maximum
likelihood estimate,

109
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,510
we used information from all
five of the trajectories.

110
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,855
Even though we only encountered S2 once.

111
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:39,590
>> Mm-hm.

112
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,241
>> And so that's just more information
and it's more accurate, and

113
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:47,216
you would imagine that if I triple
the amount of data the 6.6 would very

114
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:48,926
quickly get closer to 3.9.

115
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:54,340
And the 12 might not move at
all if I never see S2 again.

116
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:54,840
Hm.

117
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,250
Good.
So

118
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,370
this maximum likelihood estimate is
actually using more of the data.

119
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,600
I think that's accurate.

120
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,620
The reason it's higher than it should
be is because we got, I don't know,

121
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,160
lucky I guess, and had a bunch more
transitions to the high reward state,

122
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,340
S5, than we would expect on average.

123
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,290
And we got really unlucky,
or really lucky,

124
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,720
depending on how you think about it
from this one trajectory we did from S2,

125
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,750
we got the unlikely outcome
which is high reward and so

126
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,350
we ended up with an estimate that is
way higher than it really should be.

127
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,140
>> Yeah, but look.

128
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,993
Let's imagine that we had
gotten lucky the other way,

129
00:05:32,993 --> 00:05:37,952
there's only one other possibility,
right, S2 to S3 to S4 to SF.

130
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:42,396
And if that had happened then we would
have seen the value of 1 instead of

131
00:05:42,396 --> 00:05:44,880
a value of 10 and we would have had 3.

132
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,430
>> That's right, and

133
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,610
on average it's going to turn out
to be the right answer, this 3.9.

134
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,960
But this estimate is based on
the limited data that we've got.

135
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,690
>> Right.

136
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,140
Okay, fair enough.

137
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,150
All right, but the punch line
here is that this TD(1) idea,

138
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,320
it's not using all the data,
it's using just individual runs.

139
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,510
And so when a rare thing happens on
a run, you could end up with an estimate

140
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,920
that's quite far off, and it could
maybe stay that way for a long time.

141
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,040
Whereas the maximum likelihood estimate
seemed to push you in the direction

142
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,800
of using the data that you've
got to do the best you can.

143
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,313
And so what this is pointing out is that
maybe we don't want to just do TD(1).

144
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,765
There's some nice things about TD(1),
but maybe we can shore up some of these

145
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:26,620
other issues and
come up with something even better.

146
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,400
>> What, without actually
building an entire model?

147
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,870
>> Yes!

148
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,970
>> Okay, well I look forward to that.
