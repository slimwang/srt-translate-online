So far, all the Exceptions we've seen were produced by built-in Python code. But

2
00:00:04,775 --> 00:00:08,557
you can raise Exceptions yourself. And the way to do this is to use raise

3
00:00:08,557 --> 00:00:13,262
followed by any Python Expression. As long as that Python Expression evaluates

4
00:00:13,262 --> 00:00:17,720
to some instance of Exception, this will raise the Exception that you intended.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,954
If it doesn't evaluate to an instance of Exception, well, that's probably a bug

6
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,193
in your code. It'll raise some other Exception.
