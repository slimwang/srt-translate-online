1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,700
This is sort of a tricky question, so if you, if you guessed, I don't blame you.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,110
The correct answer is number two, that what you want to do is be

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,830
open to different number of principal components being relevant to you.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,550
And the way that you figure out, sort of,

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,110
what that trend is, is just by trying different numbers.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,450
You say, just give me the first principal component, the first plus the second,

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,720
the first plus the second plus the third, and you watch how the accuracy

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,520
responds to these increasing numbers of principal components.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,240
You can also do this in just plain old feature selection as well.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,090
You say, give me all the features in the order of their importance, and

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,800
I'm just going to try adding them one at a time and

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,010
see how the accuracy responds, and cut off when it seems like it's plateauing.

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,851
One thing you don't want to do though is performing feature selection before you

14
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:42,489
go into PCA.

15
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:46,562
So remember PCA is going to find a way to combine information from

16
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:50,610
potentially many different input features together.

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,190
So if you're throwing out input features before you do PCA, you're throwing our

18
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,510
that information that, that PCA might be able to kind of rescue in a sense.

19
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,680
It's fine to do feature selection on the principal components after you've made

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,780
them, but you want to be very careful about throwing out information before you

21
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,910
perform PCA.

22
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,000
That having been said, PCA can be fairly computationally expensive.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,370
So if you have a very large input feature space and

24
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,380
you know that a lot of them are potentially completely irrelevant features,

25
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,050
go ahead and try tossing them out, but proceed with caution.
