1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this unit, we learned how to specify tokens using regular expressions.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We could break down HTML and JavaScript into words,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the smallest unit of meaning.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the next part of this class, we're going to learn how to combine those words--

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
combine those tokens into sentences, into utterances that are starting to make sense.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We're going to check them using rules of syntax, just like the rules we have

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
in natural languages.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's an exciting time, and it's a necessary part on our way to making an interpreter

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
for HTML and JavaScript a web browser.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I hope you'll join me for our next unit.
