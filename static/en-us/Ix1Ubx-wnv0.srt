00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,926
The answer is 0. The graph of y equals x squared plus one doesn't touch the x

2
00:00:04,926 --> 00:00:09,850
axis at all. Let's take a peek at the graph. So here is a beautiful graph of y

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,970
equals x squared plus one, you can see that the lowest point on the parabola is

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,561
above the x axis. So, the fact that X squared plus 1 doesn't have any real

5
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:24,174
linear factors means that its graph doesn't intersect the X axis. This is a

6
00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:28,879
great example of a lot of the things we've been talking about in this lesson.
