00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,600
Here's a quiz.

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,580
Use truth tables, or

3
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,950
whatever method you want to fill
in the values of these tables.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,830
For each of the values of P and Q,
false false, false true, true false, or

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,160
true true,
look at each of these boxes and

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,100
click on just the boxes in which the
formula for that column will be true.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,089
So, which of these four boxes,
if any, will this formula be true?

8
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:28,379
And this formula, and this formula.
