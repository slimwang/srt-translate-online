1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,630
What answer did you think about, David?

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,360
>> So this is a tiny bit different
than the one we saw earlier.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,130
Earlier, we saw this exercise
without the square as an option, so

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,940
we were forced to pick the triangle.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,930
But here, since we actually have the
square as the option, I think the easier

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,079
transformation is to say that
the middle shape is disappearing.

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,120
Thus, the triangle disappears and
leaves us with just that square.

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,950
So, I'd say that five
is the correct answer.

9
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,270
>> That's a good answer, David,

10
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,800
but note that three could also be
an answer because one could imagine

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,910
the relationship between A and
B a little differently.

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,560
Suppose we were to say that
the outer circle is disappearing and

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,650
the inner circle is expanding.

14
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,650
In that case, we will again get B.

15
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,540
So in that case, we might say that
the outer image is disappearing,

16
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,320
this square, and the inner shape
is expanding to give us three.

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,280
So three is also a legitimate answer.

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,130
>> So I imagine though,

19
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,560
that most people would choose
answer five over answer three.

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,760
But why would most of us choose
answer five over answer three?

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,930
>> That's a great question.

22
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,540
Let's look at this in more detail.
