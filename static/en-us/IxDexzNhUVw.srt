1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,324
The angle between a vector and itself is 0 degrees. The dot product computes

2
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:07,905
the cosine between 2 vectors, times the length of each vector involved. The

3
00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:12,000
cosine of 0 degrees is 1, but the length of the vector is not necessarily 1, so

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,986
the dot product itself is not guaranteed to be 1. This statement is false. If

5
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:21,775
the vector was stated to be normalized, this statement would be true. If two

6
00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:26,070
vectors are perpendicular, they are 90 degrees apart. The cosine of 90 degrees

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,084
is 0, so this statement is true. The cross product of two vectors computes the

8
00:00:30,084 --> 00:00:33,252
sine of the angle between the vectors, expressed as the length of the resulting

9
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:37,958
vector. This sine can vary from negative 1 to 1, so the length of the resulting

10
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:42,076
vector can also vary in length. If the two normalized vectors are

11
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:46,390
perpendicular, the length is always 1, but not at any other angle. This

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,475
statement is false. The angle between the vector and itself is 0 degrees, so

13
00:00:50,475 --> 00:00:55,016
the sine will be 0, meaning the resulting vector will always be length 0. This

14
00:00:55,016 --> 00:00:55,860
statement is true.
