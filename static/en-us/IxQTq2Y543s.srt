00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,180
So, taking a look at this snippet of code,

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,030
it looks like $(document).click() is taking in some kind of function.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,260
We see function, then a parameter, and

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,590
then these curly braces that are passing in, well, some instructions.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,800
This is similar to regular function syntax,

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,610
where we declare a function with the keyword function, set some parameters, and

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,320
then put code inside curly braces.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,930
But this function doesn't seem to have a name.

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,600
And that's kind of curious.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,200
So let's go ahead and open up Google.

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,450
I typed in JavaScript function without name and

12
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,480
I'm going to take a look at the results.

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,950
We came across an article about JavaScript Anonymous Functions.

14
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,190
This seems really useful.

15
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,520
It looks like an anonymous function is one that's declared without a name.

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,870
That sounds like what we've got.

17
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,160
So it looks like $(document).click is taking an anonymous function as

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,750
a parameter.

19
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,840
You'll find anonymous functions all over the place in JavaScript.

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,990
So I encourage you to check out the resources in the Instructor Notes to learn

21
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,550
more about them.
