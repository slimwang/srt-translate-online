Sometimes you implement a monetization
strategy that looks great on paper, and

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,140
after you give it a chance,
you realize it's not making any money.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,940
>> There could be a lot of reasons.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,885
In these cases, you want to
see what your users are doing

5
00:00:14,885 --> 00:00:16,995
while they're interacting
with your sites or app.

6
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:21,615
>> In the examples that follow, we'll
use google analytics, and you can take

7
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:25,985
the principles from our examples and
use it in other tools if you want.

00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:30,495
>> We'll be investigating in four
areas: user behavior, crashes and

9
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:33,595
exceptions, out performance,
and special events.
