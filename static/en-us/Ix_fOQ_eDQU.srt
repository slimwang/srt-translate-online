00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,850
Now, we can play the same game, for ever more complex sentences. So,

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,920
here I've again, three predicates, A, B and C. And here's a more

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,470
complicated sentence that involves all three of those predicates. A or B, and

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,610
within parentheses, B and, nought C. And we can find the truth values for

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,530
this particular, sentence, given the truth values for the predicates A, B and

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,740
C. Why don't you give it a try and write down the values here?
