1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,690
As you can see the randomized algorithms generally have much better time bounds

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:08,800
or well they might not seem much, but you already know that for exponential time algorithms

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,940
little differences here so 1.47 versus 1.32 actually makes quite a difference

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,500
so they have generally a lot better time bounds than the deterministic algorithms

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,769
It seems that randomized algorithms allows us to achieve

6
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:25,860
a better worst-case running time than deterministic algorithms.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:31,780
Of course, up here it has the advantage that it's actually done after this amount of time

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,270
whereas down here, it's always an expected running time

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,720
and as I said you're gambling a little bit.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,079
You cannot be 100% sure that the algorithm

11
00:00:38,079 --> 99:59:59,999
has found a satisfying assignment even though there might be one.
