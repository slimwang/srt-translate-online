1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,400
The answer is that B is true, and

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,630
we know that because it was one of the
three sentences that was given to us.

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:10,580
And now, according to the first
sentence, it says that if E or

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,150
B is true, then A is true.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,096
So now we know that A is true.

6
00:00:15,096 --> 00:00:21,567
And the second sentence says if
A is true, then J and M are true.

7
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:22,138
What about E?

8
00:00:22,138 --> 00:00:23,289
That wasn't mentioned.

9
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,117
Does that mean E is false?

10
00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:27,500
No, it means that it's unknown.

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,934
That a model where E is true and

12
00:00:29,934 --> 00:00:34,449
a model where E is false, would
both satisfy these three sentences.

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,475
So we mark E as unknown.

14
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:38,988
