00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,393
The least common denominator is going to be 40. I dont' need to worry about the

2
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:08,708
4 since 4 goes into 8, so I just need to worry about the 5 in the denominator,

3
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:13,215
and the 8 in the denominator. The only factors in common between 5 and 8 are 1.

4
00:00:13,316 --> 00:00:17,644
So that leaves 5 times 1 times 8, which is 40. That quiz is pretty tough, so

5
00:00:17,656 --> 00:00:20,760
don't worry if you didn't get it right on the first try.
