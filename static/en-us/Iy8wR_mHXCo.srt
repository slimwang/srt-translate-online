00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,550
Everything that we've drawn so far was in black. Now, black is a marvelous

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,820
color, but what if you'd like another one, such as one of these? These colors

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,780
have predefined names, and when you look here, you can see that every color is

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,430
a mixture of a red, green, and blue component. Red has only red, and no green

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,320
and blue. Blue has only blue and no red and green. Yellow has red and green,

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,050
and no blue. You can make other mixtures, and you'll explore that in the

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,600
exercises that are going to be coming up right now, let's just stick with red.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,850
Let's say we have a rectangle that we want to draw in red. You set the color to

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,320
the color constant red in this way, and then when you draw it, it shows up in

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,730
red. Alternatively, you can call the fill method, and then the interior's also

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,860
drawn in red. Now you know everything about the graphics library to make fancy

12
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,210
drawings on your own. Go ahead and do the practice assignments with Sara. And

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,350
when you're done, maybe you'll be motivated to recreate Udacity train. Or

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,280
create a fancy drawing of your own and share it with us on the discussion

15
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:58,719
group.
