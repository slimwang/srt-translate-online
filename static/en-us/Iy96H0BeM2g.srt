00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,234
One of the more solid findings of cognitive change in late adulthood is between

2
00:00:04,234 --> 00:00:10,290
two kinds of intelligence: crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,042
Crystallized intelligence is what we know from experience, culture, learning

4
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:18,351
and education. Crystallized intelligence is used when we try to solve problems

5
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:22,906
that we've seen before. Fluid intelligence is a more pure intelligence. It's

6
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:27,672
raw processing speed, your mental quickness and abstract reasoning. This is

7
00:00:27,672 --> 00:00:30,920
used when we attempt to solve problems that we've never seen before. It might

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,602
help to look at these on the graph. Here, we see crystallized intelligence, in

9
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:38,458
this area. What's clear with aging is that crystallized intelligence doesn't

10
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:43,008
decline. However, as we see here with fluid intelligence, it does begin to

11
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,709
decline at about middle adulthood.
