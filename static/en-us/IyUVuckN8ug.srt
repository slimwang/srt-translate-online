00:00:04,118 --> 00:00:04,890
Dan!

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,030
Thanks for coming!

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,940
>> Yeah, I heard you wanted to talk
about Sunshine, great app isn't it?

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,354
>> Yeah, it's a great learning exercise,

5
00:00:13,354 --> 00:00:16,830
and with a little more polish
it could be a great prototype.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,310
>> Prototype?

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,330
I thought we were done with Sunshine.

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,420
Wasn't that what the great
party was all about?

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,700
>> Well, you're half right.

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,405
It was a great party.

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,320
Look, Sunshine does function,

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,500
but we've got a long way to go
before it's production ready.

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,080
Remember, it's that last 10% of
polishing those unique features that

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,040
make all the difference to real users.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,510
Get it ready for real users, and then
you'll be ready for your own lab coat.

16
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,010
Maybe.

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,530
>> Well, sure, I had a couple things
in mind that we didn't get to.

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,800
>> Great.
I thought you'd have some ideas.

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,780
And I've brought in some extra help for
you to get it done.

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,378
You need to go talk to the fix-it team.

21
00:00:58,378 --> 00:00:59,975
>> So I guess I should be leaving now?

22
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:06,601
Here's to more Sunshine.

23
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:16,601
[MUSIC]

24
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:25,889
So, I've got this app, and
it's not production quality,

25
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:31,840
and students are watching,
and I need your help.

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,978
>> Sure, we can take a look.

27
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:34,913
[SOUND] Yeah.

28
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,303
>> Mm.

29
00:01:38,303 --> 00:01:39,426
>> Oh my.
>> Mm.

30
00:01:39,426 --> 00:01:42,428
Mm, well,
this is certainly functional and

31
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:46,480
we can work with you to help
you make it production ready.

32
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,470
>> Awesome,
what do we need to do to get started?

33
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,800
>> I think it would be good to hear from
you on exactly where Sunshine is now.

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,190
>> No time like the present.

35
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,690
Let's go.
