00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,310
Recall that a bitonic split takes
a bitonic sequence as input and

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,950
produces two bitonic
subsequences as output.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,280
Now suppose I give you an eight
element bitonic sequence.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,900
You can implement an eight
element bitonic split

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,149
using a comparator circuit.

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,440
I want you to show me how.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,320
I want you to do that by adding
plus comparators to this circuit.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,340
Insert no more than one
comparator per column.

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,760
Here's an example of
what I want you to do.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,580
Suppose you wanted to connect this input
and this input by a plus comparator.

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,650
You would do that by
checking these two boxes.

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,670
If you left these three columns blank,
then this would be the output.

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,230
Okay, now I want you to try.
