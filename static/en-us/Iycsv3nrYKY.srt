00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,667
Here's some of the operations that
are part of the Posix Semaphore API.

2
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:09,080
Semaphore.h defines
the sem_t semaphore type.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,680
Initializing a semaphore is
done with the sem_init code.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,528
This takes as a parameter of
semaphore beta type variable and

5
00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:21,300
also it takes the initialization
count and a flag.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,250
This flag will indicate whether
the semaphore is shared by

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,116
threads within a single process or
across processes.

8
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:31,850
The sem_wait and
sem_post operations take as a parameter

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,290
the semaphore variable that
was previously initialized.
