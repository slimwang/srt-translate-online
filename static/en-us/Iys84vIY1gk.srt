1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,520
The first approach,
a network monitor that analyzes traffic

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,110
to detect anomalies or
known bad traffic.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,990
For example, traffic to known bad or
suspicious domains.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,530
This can be useful, for
example, if the APT malware,

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,730
after stealing credentials from
the sysadmin, now steals data

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,020
from the company's server and sends it
to attack a server on the Internet.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,240
A network monitor may be able to detect
or at least log such traffic for

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,220
further analysis.

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,510
So this is useful.

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,840
A host monitor that examines
operating system activities

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,660
such as access to files.

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,820
Again, this is useful because,
for example, if the APT malware

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,620
is stealing data from the server,
it needs to access files on the server.

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,180
Therefore, if the monitor can
log such access to files,

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,330
it may be able to help
detecting such APT malware.

16
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,502
So this is useful as well.

17
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:51,170
The third approach,

18
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,100
a malware analysis system that
identifies malicious logic, for example,

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,100
by running the browser in a sandbox and
tracing its detail execution.

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,380
This is useful, for example,
if you run the malware in a system,

21
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,480
such as a sandbox, and trace its
execution at the instruction level.

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,440
Then we can identify that there
is a part of the browser that

23
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,660
modifies the PDF document.

24
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,960
And this part of the browser
is the malicious extension.

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,800
So this is useful.

26
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:22,480
This quiz illustrates that to detect
a malware, in particular APT malware,

27
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,870
we need a comprehensive approach
such as including network monitor,

28
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,000
host monitor, and
malware analysis system.
