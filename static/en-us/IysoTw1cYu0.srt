1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,280
So next time,

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,580
we're going to to do a we're not going
to give up generative models yet.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,830
We're going to show you a really
cool way of building a sort

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,160
of a low dimensional generative model
called Principal Component Analysis.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,480
It was first done not first, but
became popular when done for

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,020
face recognition, and
that's a form of a general model.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,174
But more important, you'll just
learn about principle components.

8
00:00:23,174 --> 00:00:25,660
Which is used a lot in computer vision,
and for all sorts of things.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,900
And after we do that,

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,270
we're going to move to this other set
of methods which are discriminative.

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,970
Where instead of modeling the,
the, categories themselves,

12
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,000
instead we learn about the boundaries
between the categories.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,420
And that we'll continue to do as
we talk more about recognition.
