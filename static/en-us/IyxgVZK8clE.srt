00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Given this central-difference formula for the second derivative,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
try to figure out essential difference formula for the fourth derivative.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The rate of change of the rate of change of the rate of change of the rate of change.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Obviously, there's is a factor of 1/Δx⁴, but how much of these values of the functions do we need

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
as we go one step to the left, two steps to the left, one step to the right, two steps to the right.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Insert the correct numbers.
