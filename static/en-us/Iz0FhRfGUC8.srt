1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,060
Since it is well known that processes scheduling

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,040
is np complete we have to resort to heuristics

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,680
to come up with good scheduling algorithms. the

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,780
literature is ripe with such heuristics, as the workload

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,780
changes And the details of the parallel system,

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,850
namely how many processors does it have, how many

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,560
cores does it have, how many levels of caches

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,370
does it have, and how are the caches organized.

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,100
There's always a need for coming up with better heuristics. In other words,

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,780
we've not seen the last word yet on scheduling algorithms for parallel systems.
