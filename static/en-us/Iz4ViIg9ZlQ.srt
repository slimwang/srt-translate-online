1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Look at this, this is very nontrivial but armed with this,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
we can now build up the truth table for all the cases of the two different variables,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
cancer and non-cancer and positive and negative tests outcome.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, let me write down cancer and test and let me go through different possibilities.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We could have cancer or not, and the test may come up positive or negative.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So, please give me the probability of the combination of those for the very first one,

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and as a hint, it's kind of the same as before where we multiply two things,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
but you have to find the right things to multiple in this table over here.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is not an easy question.
