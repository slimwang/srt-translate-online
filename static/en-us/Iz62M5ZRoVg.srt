00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,755
Now we were discussing encoding, which is the first step in our ability to move

2
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:08,922
information from our short term to our long term memory. Now the second stage

3
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:14,280
in long term memory formation is consolidation. And consolidation is the

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,026
process of establishing, stabilizing or solidifying a memory. If you'll recall

5
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:23,590
from our lesson on consciousness, you'll remember that sleep is essential for

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:28,132
our ability to consolidate our memories. In fact, sleep deprivation can

7
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:31,809
negatively affect our ability to remember. So as we stressed in the

8
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:35,226
consciousness lesson, it's important that we get the required amount of sleep,

9
00:00:35,226 --> 00:00:38,199
so that we can consolidate our memories.
