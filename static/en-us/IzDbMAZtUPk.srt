00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,900
Execution contexts or in memory
scopes differ from lexical scopes.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,650
In that, they are built as
the code runs, not as it's typed.

00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,730
The rules govern which variables
a program has access to at

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,250
different points during the execution.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,170
Let's explore how variables
will be available at runtime

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,350
within in different contexts.
