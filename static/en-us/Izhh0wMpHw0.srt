00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's try our hand at interpreting function definitions.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'll do the first part, you fill in the rest.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In JavaScript, function definitions are top level elements of a JavaScript program.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
They're not statements and they're not expressions,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so we're going to have a new evaluation function, evaluate elements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Here's the abstract syntax tree for the element, here's the current environment.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
As usual, we get the type of our tree node by looking at part 0.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If it's a function definition, then we're going to pull out the function name,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
the function parameters, the function body,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and then we're going to make up a function value out of that.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's going to be a for tuple, and then we're going to add that to the environment.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Fill in each one of these 4 blanks so that the code works correctly,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so that we return the right sort of function value and then add it to the environment.
