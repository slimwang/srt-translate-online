1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,050
That ends this lesson on the relationship between convolution in

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,689
the spacial domain and the frequency domain.

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:11,270
In particular the convolution in the spacial domain is multiplication in

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,820
the frequency domain.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,890
We've also made good on the promise of explaining some of some of

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,940
these ugly artifacts that we saw particular ringing is sort of

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,680
a Fourier transform of a box that is if you cut off the frequencies hard.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,550
You get this ring or if you have a cutoff in space that's hard,

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,520
you get this ringing in frequency.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,280
What we now have are the tools that will allow us to tackle aliasing.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,030
That is when you do something to an image that involves sampling that causes it

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,410
to look really ugly.

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,020
And the high frequency stuff.

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,260
It's a little bit of of a bumpy ride, so strap yourself in and

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,290
get ready for the next lesson.
