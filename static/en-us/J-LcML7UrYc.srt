00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,320
In the Soonami app,

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,430
when we form the HTTP request
to the USGS server, we specify

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,280
GET as the HTTP method because we want
to retrieve data from the server.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,010
In other words, we just want to read
earthquake information from the USGS.
