1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,360
So to think about writing something up in OCL,

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:10,980
the first thing to think about is, which of the classes in the diagram,

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,690
is the most appropriate place to annotate to make that expression.

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,390
And, OCL has a key word called context. And

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:25,670
the context is typically the name of a class or a method in a class, and in

6
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:31,510
deciding that you're going to write an OCL expression, you need to first decide,

7
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:36,680
which of the classes or methods you sh, you should use. Okay. So,

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,290
with respect to these books are checked out, requirement, which of these classes

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,050
do you think would be the appropriate one to associate with that requirement.
