1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,550
Following the pattern we see up here, and should be the coefficient in front of

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:11,134
log base 10 of 5. So we should have n log base 10 of 5. This property that

3
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:14,851
we've been using is called the power property, and as we can see, it allows us

4
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:19,109
to write the log without the exponent of the input.
