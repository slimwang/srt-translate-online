1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,964
So here's the actual definition of Coco
values that we're going to use and

2
00:00:03,964 --> 00:00:06,030
they come from the [INAUDIBLE] work.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,100
So the coco value of a game is
going to be defined like this.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,320
Let's imagine that we've got a general
sum game with a notation I'm going to

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,390
use is U is the payoff to you and
U bar is the payoff to not you, right?

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:19,950
The other person.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,950
>> Yeah, that makes sense.

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,370
Although I like that you use the bar
because that means complement.

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,180
>> Yeah.
>> So you're saying we

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,080
complement each other.

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,390
>> This has nothing to do with me.

12
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,330
>> It said you.

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,030
>> It has something to
do with you [LAUGH].

14
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,990
>> Okay, now you're just
confusing me with your pronouns.

15
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:31,780
>> All right, sorry.

16
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,020
So I should have called
the other matrix I.

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,690
No wait, that's not going to help.

18
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:40,250
All right, so the general sum game that
we're actually solving here is U, U bar.

19
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,520
And why don't we just compute say a nash
equilibrium of that general sum game.

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,480
Well there's a bunch of reasons,
one is that they're hard to compute.

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,330
Another is that maybe it would
be indifferent to getting

22
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,860
those extra bananas and
sharing them around.

23
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,600
So what we're going to do is we're
going to define the coco value and

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,110
we're going to use the coco value
to actually divide the spoils.

25
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,270
Here's how the coco values defined,

26
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,810
we're going to take
the general sum game U, U bar.

27
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,330
And we're going to turn it into sort

28
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,700
of redistribute all those utilities
that are in those two matrices.

29
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,130
To create two matrices,
one that's purely cooperative and

30
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,670
one that's purely competitive.

31
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,200
We're going to create one game by
thinking about the average values that

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,184
the two of us would get for each of
the different possible joint actions.

33
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:26,059
>> Sure.

34
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:28,630
>> So imagine that we would
just get whatever we get and

35
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,560
then we split it evenly.

36
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,325
>> Okay.
>> All right,

37
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:31,834
that's very cooperative, right.

38
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:32,660
>> It's very cooperative.

39
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,890
>> And in fact mathematically,
it's just U plus U bar over 2,

40
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,348
it becomes the matrix payoff that
we're both going to abide by.

41
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:40,220
>> It's injuries more.

42
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,800
>> Purely competitive version is for
us to look at the difference between

43
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,430
the utilities that we get and
split that in half, right?

44
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:52,520
So it ought to be the case that if
we add these two matrices together,

45
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,840
U plus U bar over 2 and
U minus U bar over 2.

46
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,490
What we get U for my perspective,
sorry, from U's perspective.

47
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,915
And we get U bar from
the perspective of the other player.

48
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:10,530
So we recover those same utilities
from the general sum game.

49
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,305
>> Mm-hm.

50
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:14,710
>> But again, we've redistributed
into these two matrices,

51
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,280
one of which is purely cooperative,
we get the same payoffs.

52
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,787
And the other one is pretty
competitive because one of us

53
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:22,238
is playing U minus U bar over 2.

54
00:02:22,238 --> 00:02:25,900
And I was playing the negation of
that which is U bar minus U over 2.

55
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,186
Right, so what's good for you is bad for
the other player and vice-versa.

56
00:02:30,186 --> 00:02:31,100
>> Okay.
>> In particular,

57
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,200
this is zero sum game now.

58
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,434
>> I was actually going to ask what
would happen if you were playing a zero

59
00:02:36,434 --> 00:02:36,966
sum game?

60
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:40,042
Then U plus U bar would
always be zero and in fact,

61
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:42,630
this would say you do
minimax on the gap.

62
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,340
>> U plus U bar would always be zero.

63
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,080
Yeah, once we've redistributed
these into a new U and U bar, yes.

64
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,760
And so right and so

65
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,940
what's the Nash like thing with
the equilibrium like thing to do

66
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,350
when we're playing a purely competitive
game and that's to take minimax.

67
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,897
So we're actually going to compute
the minimax value of that game and

68
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:02,378
we're going to compute
match the max max value.

69
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:06,760
In other words, which cell has
the highest sum payoff or average.

70
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,990
If you say sum and average is the same.

71
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,240
Find the cell that has
the largest thing and say okay,

72
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,540
well that is also a Nash equilibrium
of the purely cooperative game.

73
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,700
because if we choose the square that has
the highest payoff out of everything,

74
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,900
then we're going to have no incentive
to switch to something else.

75
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,900
>> That's right.
>> How do we compute

76
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,140
the cooperative equilibrium?

77
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,910
>> You just replace all the things with
their sum and take the biggest one.

78
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,530
>> So it's like taking a max
of all the cells on matrix.

79
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,060
>> A max of all the of the new sales.

80
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,524
>> Of the new meter, that's right.

81
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:38,689
And what about minimax?

82
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:40,830
Do you know I remember how to do that?

83
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,892
>> No, I do, I've tried to
remember which one is which,

84
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:46,900
well, let's pretend I don't
remember how to do it.

85
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,510
>> Anything that's not a dynamic
program is a linear program.

86
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,192
>> And truer words never been spoken.

87
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:54,298
>> [LAUGH] Because it's
all about programming.

88
00:03:54,298 --> 00:03:56,840
>> [LAUGH]
>> All right, so in particular, you

89
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,750
can set this this problem up as a linear
program and solve it in polynomial time.

90
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,710
So this is efficient.

91
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,130
At least you know in a formal
mathematical computer science-y

92
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,060
kind of sense.

93
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,878
And so is this.

94
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:08,240
>> Right.
>> So we took up a game that we

95
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,301
actually don't know how to solve because
computing a Nash equilibrium can be

96
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:15,100
really hard and
we've broken up into two.

97
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,593
Again, just by redistributing the
wealth, redistributing the utilities.

98
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,060
>> Mm-hm.
>> We actually split it up into two

99
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,460
games that are the same amount of
utility is being spread around.

100
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,360
But we can actually compute
the equilibrium value for

101
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,760
both of them really easily.

102
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,290
And then we're just
going to add them together.

103
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,290
>> Okay, and
then what does it tell us to do?

104
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:32,790
>> Good question.
