Here's a quick question on independence.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,140
Suppose that there's a 0.1 probability

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,880
that Sam will get a bullseye
each time that he throws a dart.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,510
What is the probability that
he gets 5 bullseyes in a row?
