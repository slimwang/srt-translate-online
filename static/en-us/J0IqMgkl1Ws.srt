1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,790
Here we want a summary of the friend rate. So,

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,250
we can use the with command and subset the data

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,840
so we only consider users with tenure of at least

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,410
one day. Now we just want a summary of friend count

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,310
divided by tenure, which gives us the friends per day

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,350
since the user's been active. When we run the code,

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,271
we see that the median rate is about 0.22, and

8
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:24,850
the maximum rate is 417. Now, this is definitely an outlier,

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:29,015
considering our data, since the third quartile is only about 0.5.
