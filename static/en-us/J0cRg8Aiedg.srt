[Evans] Let's think about how to define union.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We need to make a procedure that takes 2 lists as its inputs.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We'll call the lists p and q.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
To define union we want to modify p by adding elements from q.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We should remember that append operation does that.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It adds a new element to a list.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So we're going to use append to add elements from q to p.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
To define union we need to go through all the elements in q.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Check for each element whether it already exists in p.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If it does, we do nothing.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If it doesn't, then we add it to p.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So we'll use a for-loop.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We need to make sure that we loop through the elements of q.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Those are the ones that we want to add to p.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
For each element we need to test whether or not it's already in p,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
so we check to make sure the element is not already in p.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If this is true, that means e is not in p,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and we want to add it.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
To add e to p, we use append.
