1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,468
Here are the steps that you'll
be implementing for signing in.

2
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:06,689
It's a little bit involved, so
let's go through each step one by one.

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:07,570
First things first,

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,000
you'll add the correct dependencies
to friendly chat for authentication.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,949
Second, you'll add a special listener
which is called an AuthStateListener.

6
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:18,839
This listener is triggered when
the user's authentication state changes.

7
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:21,660
An authentication state change
is something like signing in or

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,750
logging out.

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,429
Third, now that you have this listener,
you can redirect the user to log in

10
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,539
if they've opened the app and
they're not already logged in.

11
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:30,669
At this point,

12
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,950
you'll basically have an app that
detects if the user is logged in or not.

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,270
And if they're not logged in,
it'll force them to log in.

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,730
For step four, the log code which
changes the UI to reflect whether

15
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:43,219
the user is logged in or logged out.

16
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:45,299
That change comes in two parts.

17
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,099
When the user is logged in, you'll
have the access to their user name.

18
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,880
So you can use it when they're
writing messages to the Database.

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,830
You can also attach the Database
read messenger at this point.

20
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:57,509
You'll only attach the Database read
listeners after user is sign in.

21
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:00,989
This is because unauthenticated user
doesn't have permission to read from

22
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,170
the Database.

23
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,739
And when a user signs out, they'll tear
down what you set up in the sign in

24
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:10,189
which will mean things like unsaving
the user name of the signed out user.

25
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:13,549
You'll unset the user name of
the user that just signed out.

26
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:17,379
You'll detach your database listeners,
and you'll clear the message list.

27
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:20,890
And after all that's done you'll
open up the sign in flow again.

28
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,750
Okay, onward to the code.

29
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,930
The first step is to add
the appropriate dependency.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,319
Here is the dependency for
authentication.

31
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,779
So if you're using any kind of firebase
oath, you'll need this dependency.

32
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,790
Ill go ahead and add that to my apps
bill dot great file right down here.

33
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,340
Since you're also using Firebase UIR,
you'll need that dependency as well.

34
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,070
Okay, so there are my new dependencies.

35
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,439
I'm going to go ahead and synch.

36
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,689
Remember to check that the Firebase UI
version that you're using

37
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,259
matches the Firebase SDK
version that you're using.

38
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:55,269
All right, now that you've added your
dependencies you're ready to get coding.

39
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:56,099
So let's get to it.
