00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You probably got it right. It's 86.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The reason is the value of the goal is 100, 99, 98, 97.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It turns out the start state is 14 steps away from the goal,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so 100 minus 14 is 86.
