1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,680
In Alteryx, we're going to leverage the
same tool we have been using to validate

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,110
our individual models to compare all
three of our models side by side,

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,460
the model comparison tool.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,460
So, as you see on the canvas,

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,480
we have all three models already built
out since we've done that already.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,870
What I'm going to do now is union
the three model objects together, and

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,280
then load those into the model
comparison report, so I'm able to

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,460
determine which model actually performs
better by looking at them side by side.

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,100
So, let's bring in now a union tool

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,420
to union the three model
objects in together.

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,790
Then I'll bring in a model comparison
tool, and load those union results with

12
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,410
the model objects into the M, our model
input for the model comparison tool.

13
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,250
And the validation dataset goes
into then the D, our data side.

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,610
Let's bring in a browse tool
after the R output, and

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,680
let's kick off this workflow.

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,150
So now that this ran,
let's open up this result output so

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,630
we can go and interpret the results.

18
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,970
What we're able to see here is
all the models side by side for

19
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,660
their fit and error measures.

20
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,290
So, we're able to determine
each of the individual models

21
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,380
total accuracy with that
validation dataset,

22
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,990
as well as how well each of the models
performed at trying to predict

23
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,435
each mode of transportation
within that validation dataset.

24
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:34,885
The other thing we're able to look
at is the confusion matrices of

25
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:37,935
each of the different models
with that validation dataset

26
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:41,165
to see if there's any trends or
biases within this model.
