00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,030
Now, let's dig a little deeper into the power of abstraction as it applies to

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,270
computer systems. Now, here I'm showing you

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,280
a screenshot of the Google Earth application. Deep

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,410
down in the silicon, you have electrons

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,210
and holes. You may have heard about these

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,320
terminologies or worked with them in a physics 101 course at some point of time.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,750
Let's say that in an application such as Google Earth, you move your mouse

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,620
from Atlanta, Georgia to Chennai, India. When you do that, magic

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,780
happens on the screen. Now, between a user action,

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,470
such as moving the mouse from Atlanta, Georgia to Chennai,

11
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:51,420
India, and the solid state electronics that

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,890
is enshrined in your computer system, there is a whole series of abstractions.
