>> Well you have learned a lot about lines. We've learned about slope. We've

2
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:08,241
learned about equations of lines. We've learned about horizontal and vertical

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:12,292
lines. Let's do some practice problems, shall we? For this first practice

4
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:16,109
problem, I want you to find the equation of the line. The first line is a

5
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,452
vertical line that goes through the point negative 5, 6. You can put your answer

6
00:00:20,452 --> 00:00:24,942
here. For the second one, I want you to find the equation of a horizontal line

7
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:29,328
that goes through the point negative 5, 6. And you can put your answer in this

8
00:00:29,328 --> 00:00:33,454
box. If you're not sure how to solve these problems, feel free to go back and

00:00:33,454 --> 00:00:37,451
review the videos on horizontal and vertical lines before you answer.
