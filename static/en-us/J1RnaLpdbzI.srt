00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,269
The other type of reasoning is inductive reasoning, and this is when we draw

2
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:09,019
general conclusions from specific information. Now this is different than

3
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:11,629
deductive reasoning where we can make certain and necessary correct

4
00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:16,239
conclusions. With inductive reasoning, we can only rely on highly likely

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,620
outcomes. For example, you may say that all cats you've known have been

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,004
friendly; therefore, all cats are friendly. And that may be the case for your

7
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:29,354
experiences. But for me, I've known some friendly cats, but I was also attacked

8
00:00:29,354 --> 00:00:33,745
by a pack of feral cats when I was a little girl. Therefore, your inductive

9
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:36,930
reasoning is different than my inductive reasoning, and we can't be sure that

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,164
we've come to the correct conclusion. But let's go to Greg now and he's going

11
00:00:41,164 --> 00:00:44,380
to discuss inductive reasoning in a little more detail.
