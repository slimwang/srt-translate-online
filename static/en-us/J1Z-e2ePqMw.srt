1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,222
So, we saw that the program we wrote won't work well if we never find something

2
00:00:03,222 --> 00:00:08,548
that matches. Let's update the first matching program so that prints out there

3
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:13,760
are no long words if it doesn't find a long word. So that you can see the in

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,268
action pretend that you're looking for words that are longer than 30

5
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:20,758
characters. Your code will go down here.
