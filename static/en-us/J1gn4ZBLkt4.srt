00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,180
Okay, so let's do this. We've taken a look

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,290
at our HTTP traffic from our client application. Let's go

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,720
back to the browser and see what it's doing differently.

4
00:00:09,852 --> 00:00:12,502
We going to go look at the network request again and

5
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:14,940
if I scroll up, there's a cookie here, there's

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,260
some session data that is being maintained by the browser

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,660
and passed along. That's potentially at least part of the

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,130
problem, so. What we can do then is actually maintain

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,070
session state in our code. So what I've done

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,920
here is modified what we looked at before. And in

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,200
this case, we're going to use a session object

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,280
instead of just a request object to do both our

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,020
get and our post. We'll be using the same

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,260
session object, so any session information that we get back

15
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,690
from this first request, will be maintained and passed

16
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,200
along when we make this request. Alright, let's run this.

17
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:52,250
Let me go back to the browser and see if we've

18
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,640
got a correct response or a response that gives us back

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,380
the data we're hoping to get. And now we could see

20
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,493
that the data we get, is actually what we were expecting. So,

21
00:01:01,493 --> 00:01:05,197
note that this is actually a local file and is in

22
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:09,344
fact the local file that we were writing out here. And

23
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:11,774
we've got the right settings here, what we would have expected

24
00:01:11,774 --> 00:01:15,365
had we actually submitted this through the browser. And, we're pulling back

25
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:19,730
the data that we hoped to get. Still missing the CSS files, but we don't

26
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,850
care all we care about is this data right here. Whoo hoo! We did it!
