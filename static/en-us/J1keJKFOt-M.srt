00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,116
For this problem x equals positive 12. Great effort for getting this one

2
00:00:05,116 --> 00:00:09,571
correct. I hope you're on a roll with these. We start solving by isolating this

3
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:13,847
cube root on one side of the equal sign. This means we'll have to subtract 5

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:18,858
from both sides, in order to isolate this cubed root. To undo this cube root,

5
00:00:18,858 --> 00:00:24,390
we raise both sides to the third power. The cube of the cube root x minus 4, is

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,782
just x minus 4 and the cube of 2 equals 8. Now we're ready to solve for x and

7
00:00:29,782 --> 00:00:33,086
we just add 4 to both sides to get x equals 12 and as always, we want to make

8
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:37,888
sure to check. We take the value of 12 and plug it in for x into the original

9
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:42,550
equation. This cube root simplifies to the cube root of 8, which equals

10
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,590
positive 2. 2 plus 5 equals 7. So yes, our solution checks.
