00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,590
>> It turns out the two car companies would never cost the same. For a one hour

00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,561
car rental, Rad Rentals would cost $20 and Mini-Hoopties would cost $30. We know

00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:14,180
Rad Rentals is the cheaper option here. The same is true for a five hour car

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,237
rental. Rad Rentals would cost $60. And Mini-Hoopties would cost $70. We can see

5
00:00:19,237 --> 00:00:23,398
on our graph that Rad Rentals, or its cost, is always below the cost of

6
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:28,166
Mini-Hoopties. Getting a car from Rad Rentals will be always be less than one

7
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,979
from Mini-Hoopties. So, we know they'll never cost the same.
