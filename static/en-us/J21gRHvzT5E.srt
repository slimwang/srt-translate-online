1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,050
So let's continue to look at aperture.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:07,830
Here I've just schematically shown you f/2.8 to f/16, larger

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,160
aperture opening, smaller number, smaller aperture opening, larger number.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,891
So the f number here is 16, the f number here is 2.8.

5
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:21,351
more, the larger the opening, more the light will enter the sensor,

6
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:25,206
smaller the opening, less the light will enter the sensor,

7
00:00:25,206 --> 00:00:31,120
assuming we keep the fixed same amount of shutter time, of the shutter speed.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,810
So, just by looking at it, we should be able to discern that, if I double the N,

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,510
it would reduce the area by 2 times, and therefore,

10
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,110
it would reduce the light by 4 times.

11
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,280
So let's look at a specific example.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,830
We will look at f/2.8 and f/5.6, where the end number has doubled.

13
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:58,544
So going from f/2.8 to f/5.6 will cut the light by four times.

14
00:00:58,544 --> 00:01:00,383
And you can actually look at the math and

15
00:01:00,383 --> 00:01:03,188
figure this one out on your own as to why that's happening.

16
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,654
Partly it has something to do with the fact that you have a square of

17
00:01:06,654 --> 00:01:10,210
this value that's going to impact the size of the area.

18
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,936
If you want to cut the light by two times,

19
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:17,819
basically what you need to do is increase the N by the square root of 2.

20
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:20,710
So that basically starts kind of giving us a sense as to why these

21
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,661
numbers are there.

22
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:25,330
And again, you can do the same math between f/4 and f/8, or

23
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,360
f/8 and f/16, to be able to get a four times reduction of light.
