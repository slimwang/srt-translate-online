00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,333
So, you can see how this diagram that I drew earlier works. The circle

2
00:00:04,345 --> 00:00:09,162
representing the natural numbers is within the circle representing the whole

3
00:00:09,174 --> 00:00:14,135
numbers, showing that the natural numbers are all included in the whole numbers.

4
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:19,139
If we pick any number, we can point to which category or categories it fits into

5
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:25,620
by pointing somewhere on this diagram. For example, if I pick 18, then 18 is a

6
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:33,299
natural number. So we can point here. But since that circle is inside of the

7
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:40,535
whole number circle, we know that 18 is also a whole number. If we pick zero

8
00:00:40,547 --> 00:00:46,812
however, We can only point to the whole number circle, not the natural number

9
00:00:46,824 --> 00:00:52,395
circle since zero is whole, but not natural And if I pick a number like 16.5,

10
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:58,152
well, that is not in either of these categories. So we would need to point

11
00:00:58,164 --> 00:01:03,273
outside of both of these circles. So you can see that we're building up this

12
00:01:03,285 --> 00:01:08,103
sort of world of numbers. And we're going to keep adding more to it. Next, we're

13
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:12,364
going to talk about integers, which, if we represent them in our world of

14
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:16,893
numbers here, would be drawn as a circle around the whole numbers like this.

15
00:01:16,997 --> 00:01:21,967
Even though I haven't told you anything about integers yet. Can you tell me just

16
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:25,950
by looking at this diagram, which of the following statements are true?
