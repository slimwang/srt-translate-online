1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,166
Just like we knew that x squared equals 3 had the solutions plus or minus the

2
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:08,320
square root of 3, here x is equal to plus or minus the square root of negative

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,466
1. However, we know that the square root of negative 1 has a different name.

4
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:16,527
It's just i, the number we've been talking about. So either positive i, or

5
00:00:16,527 --> 00:00:21,128
negative i can multiply by itself to equal negative 1. However, we said that the

6
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:26,274
positive version of the square root of negative 1 is equal to I. And logically

7
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:30,265
then, the negative version is equal to negative I.
