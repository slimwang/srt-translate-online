1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,797
>> How would you define happiness? >> Being at peace. >> The ability to , I

2
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:15,464
guess live a fulfilled life. >> It's more what you feel. What you can bring to

3
00:00:15,476 --> 00:00:20,093
others and not so much what you see. >> They kind of bounce. Their eyes get all

4
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:24,273
happy. Their ears kind of go up. They get all loose, like their body language is

5
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:28,959
real loose. and yeah, their tails wag, like he's happy right now. >> How would

6
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:32,200
you measure it? >> Oh, I don't know, I, I don't measure nothin' really.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,119
>> I just I'm happy.

8
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,765
>> I think I'd probably measure it by the number of times I smile every day. >>

9
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:43,105
I have no idea. I'd have to think about that for a sec. >> Their, their

10
00:00:43,117 --> 00:00:47,460
attitude. Their, just the way they are personally. >> If I was a researcher and

11
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:52,202
I wanted to know how well you remembered something how could I do that? >> If

12
00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:57,683
you're talking about like say, scientific experimentation. To have a control of

13
00:00:57,695 --> 00:01:03,165
some sort, you could film the experience that a person has and then interview

14
00:01:03,177 --> 00:01:08,449
that person. maybe have multiple people to interview, so you get different

15
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:13,931
points of view for the same event. And see how that differs. >> How would you

16
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:21,240
define memory? >>, >> It's an accumulation of information, data. far more

17
00:01:21,252 --> 00:01:27,805
important is how you apply that, how you use it? >> The ability to retrieve

18
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:34,954
information from your past. >> I have to think about it. >> Things I bothered to

19
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:37,755
remember for >> Later use.

20
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:44,312
>> How would you define itchiness? >> Discomfort, yeah just general discomfort.

21
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:51,297
>> Something that's irritating you, and you have to scratch it. >> The intensity

22
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:57,437
of the itch would match the time length of scratching. >> With the amount that

23
00:01:57,449 --> 00:02:02,087
they move around. >> You could ask a very forward question, like is there

24
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:04,996
something you need me to scratch? Right now.

25
00:02:04,996 --> 00:02:09,684
>> Well that sounds a little personal. >> Very close friend, maybe you could do

26
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:14,067
that. >> So kind of like happiness if you had to measure how itchy your dog was

27
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:18,511
right now, how would you do that? >> How would you quantify it? >> I'm going to

28
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:22,887
I'd, I'd definitely go with, like, how often they were scratching, or how often

29
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:27,466
they were doing sort of a full body shake. >> How would you measure stress? >> I

30
00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:31,351
think you could measure stress by, obviously, there's, I'm sure medical ways

31
00:02:31,363 --> 00:02:35,656
that you could measure stress. >> Yeah, the frown on my face, on my, on my mouth

32
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:37,609
I mean. >> Heartbeats probably.

33
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,059
The blood rushing to the head.
