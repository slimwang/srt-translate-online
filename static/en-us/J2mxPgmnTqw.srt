00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,130
In this particular application even though the user is going to see some votes.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,189
If the votes were off by one or two it probably wouldn't matter to

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,770
the application. Providing transactions in a database since can have some extra

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:17,190
costs associated with it. And the question is do you want to pay that cost if

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,770
getting the exact right numbers is not all that important. So I wouldn't answer

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,720
this particular question's that transactions are not necessarily required for.
