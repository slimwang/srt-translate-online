00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,368
Let's talk about the specific stages of language development. The first stage

2
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:08,240
is cooing. Cooing are the first sounds that human babies make, other than

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,130
crying. And this happens within the first six months of an infant's life.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,960
Cooing is almost exclusively vowels. So things like ooh, or e, for example.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,384
It's interesting to note that cooing is universal for all babies. Meaning

6
00:00:22,384 --> 00:00:27,882
babies all across the world coo in almost the exact same way. This includes

7
00:00:27,882 --> 00:00:32,131
babies who can hear, as well as babies who are deaf. The next stage is

8
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:36,550
babbling, babbling occurs after about five or six months of an infant's life.

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,770
This is when infants start to experience with different sounds call phoneme.

10
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,422
Phonemes consist of both vowels and consonants. An interesting thing to note

11
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:48,973
here is that through repeated exposure to their native language, infants start

12
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:53,965
to prune out sounds that aren't native to their language. They actually lose

13
00:00:53,965 --> 00:00:59,086
the ability to say and perceive non-native language sounds. That's why it can

14
00:00:59,086 --> 00:01:02,365
be so difficult to learn a new language. And after babbling is one word

15
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:08,120
utterances. This is when babies say things like da-da or mama or the famous no.

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,875
Next would be the two word utterances. This happens at around 18 months. But

17
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,671
I'm going to send you to Greg who has a good example of this.
