1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So the big question is here,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
how on earth are we going to do this?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Because this seems extremely difficult to show,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
so we would have to find a problem for which we can

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
prove that any other problem in NP can be reduced to it.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Luckily for us or actually more luckily for me,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
this work has already been done about 40 years ago

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
by showing a problem called Boolean

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
satisfiability, or SAT for short, to be NP-complete,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and this result is one of the most famous results in theoretical computer science,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
which is why we're going to investigate it in detail

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and also investigate the proof together.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The result is called the Cook-Levin theorem.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This theorem is named after Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
who discovered it independently of each other in the 1970s,

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and by showing that, they provided exactly this NP-complete seed problem,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
namely SAT,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
which could then be used to show that

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
a number of other problems are NP-complete as well.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And I'm then going to show you how Cook and Levin

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
proved that SAT is NP-complete,

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and once we have shown that SAT is NP-complete,

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
we can go back to the problems of Alice, Bob, and Carol

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and see if those problems are NP-complete.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Before we go deeper into the SAT problem and proving the Cook-Levin theorem,

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
here's one more quiz to make sure that you

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
understand where we are going with this.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So once we have shown that the SAT problem is NP-complete,

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
how would we then show, or at least try to show,

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
that the vertex cover problem, independent set, and clique are NP-complete?

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Would we have to show that any input for SAT,

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and I'll soon tell you what that input exactly is,

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
can be transformed into an input for one of these problems,

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and by these problems, I mean vertex cover, independent set, or clique,

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
or would we have to show that one of the three problems up here

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
can be expressed as an input to SAT?

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Or would we have to show that all three

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
problems can be expressed as an input to SAT?

39
00:01:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So please check all of these which are correct.
