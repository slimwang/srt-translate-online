00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:04,575
Here we hear from BlueJ. And it would really good idea if you fire up your own

2
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:11,100
BlueJ and move to lesson two days as your project. When you open it, you will

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:18,000
see the screen with a Day block here. And this is what gives us objects. Let me

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,680
show you how to make an object. You right-click on it, and you select the line

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,975
that says New Day. You can now give it a name. For right now, we'll accept the

6
00:00:27,975 --> 00:00:34,299
default. Down here, you'll find your first object. This is how BlueJ represents

7
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:39,610
objects. As little blobs, it's a little-known fact that all objects are red.

8
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:45,010
And to manipulate an object, you again, right-click on it. You can ask it to

9
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:50,185
get the current year. Here's the answer. This particular day is somewhere in

10
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:58,540
2013. See when, the month is March, 3, the day of the month, is the 20th.

11
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,870
That's the day that I recorded this lesson. We can make another day object. And

12
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:12,360
now, let's pick, the first line here. Now, we ask which year month and day we

13
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,690
might actually want. Let's fill in something. Then, we'll pick a year of 1964.

14
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:24,120
The month of 11 or November, and the day of 28, as I'm sure everyone remembers,

15
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:32,870
on November 28th, 1964, the first spaceship was, to Mars, was launched. Now

16
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,810
here, we have another day object. It looks just like the first one. It has a

17
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,950
different name. But if we wanted to find out anything about it, so we can in

18
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:46,120
the same way ask it what's your year, and here it tells us. Now, let's do

19
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,890
something more interesting. Let's take our first object here and let's ask it

20
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:56,340
what day comes a hundred days later. Now, it doesn't look like it, but this

21
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,000
object now has changed. It has moved itself a hundred days later. Remember, it

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,980
was originally March 20th. Now, when we ask it what's your month, you'll see

23
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,836
it's June. That makes sense, from March, 100 days is June, or maybe it would be

24
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,604
July. Somehow, this thing knows how to do this computation. How about the day?

25
00:02:09,604 --> 00:02:14,060
It's June 28th. I wouldn't have known how to do that. Except by tediously

26
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:25,940
getting out a calendar and counting the days, but our day object knows. How

27
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,240
does it know? I don't know, and I don't care. It doesn't matter. I can use it,

28
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,995
as long as I understand what it does for me. So, that's a great example of an

29
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:38,700
object. Something that knows how to do a very specific thing, namely to deal

30
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,530
with calendars, just like the water heater knows how to do very specific thing,

31
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,475
namely to heat water.
