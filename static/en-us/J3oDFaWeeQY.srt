1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,330
A fair pervasive violation of the end-to-end argument are

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,070
home gateways, which often perform something called network address

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,800
translation. Now on a home network we have many

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,240
devices that connect to the network, but when we

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,410
buy service from our internet service provider we're typically

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,750
only given one public IP address. And yet we

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,170
have a whole variety of devices that we may

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,630
want to connect. Now the idea behind network address translation

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,510
is that we can give each of these devices a private IP address and there

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,520
are designated regions of the IP address space

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,380
that are for private IP addresses. One of

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,960
those is 192.168.0.0/16 and there are others, which

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,160
you go read about in RFC 3130. Each

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,790
one of these devices in the home gets

15
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,960
its own private IP address. The public internet,

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,640
on the other hand, sees a public IP address

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,480
which typically is the IP address provided by the

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,160
internet service provider. When packets traverse the home router,

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,540
which is often running a network address translation process,

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,260
the source address of every packet is rewritten to

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,740
the public IP address. Now when traffic comes back

22
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,910
to that public IP address, the network address translator

23
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,140
needs to know which device behind the NAT the

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,650
traffic should be sent to. So it uses a mapping of port numbers to identify

25
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,670
which device the return traffic should be sent

26
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,790
to in the home network. So the NAT

27
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,620
or the network address translator maintains a table

28
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:36,500
that says packets with the source IP address

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,440
of 192.168.1.51 and source port 1000 should be

30
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,590
rewritten to a source address of the public

31
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:49,960
IP address and a source port of 50878. Similarly, packets with a source IP

32
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,357
address of 192.168.1.52 and source port of

33
00:01:52,357 --> 00:01:55,420
1000 should be rewritten to the public IP

34
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:01,290
address and a source port of 50879. Then when traffic returns to the NAT to

35
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,660
one of these addresses the NAT knows

36
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,030
that it needs to rewrite the destination address

37
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,889
on the return traffic to the appropriate destination

38
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,870
IP address and port that's in the private

39
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,100
network. So for outbound traffic, the NAT device

40
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,310
creates a table entry mapping the computer's local

41
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,630
IP address and port number to the public

42
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,310
IP address at a different port number. And

43
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,980
replaces the sending computer's non-routable IP address with

44
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,830
the gateway or the NAT public IP address.

45
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,380
It also replaces the sender's source port with a

46
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,090
different source port that allows it to demutiplex the

47
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,760
packets sent to this return address and port. For

48
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,710
inbound traffic to the home network, the NAT checks the

49
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,580
destination port on the packet, and based on the

50
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,750
port, it rewrites the destination IP address and port to

51
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,360
the private IP address in the table before forwarding

52
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,180
the traffic to a local device in the home network.
