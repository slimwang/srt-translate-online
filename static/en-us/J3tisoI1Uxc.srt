00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,320
Personal firewall is similar
to a host based firewall.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,150
It controls traffic between a personal
computer and the rest of the network.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,210
Personal firewalls
are also often deployed at

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,840
home routers to protect home networks.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,210
These firewalls tend to be
simpler because the home networks

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,090
are less complex than
the enterprise networks.

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,380
Similar to firewalls
at corporate networks,

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,210
the main function of personal firewalls
is to track traffic in both directions.

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,870
For example,
the personal firewall on the home router

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,689
can stop attacks from reaching
the internal home computers.

11
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,890
It can also monitor outgoing traffic.

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,080
For example, it can detect connection
to an extended server as known for

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,970
performing botnet command control and
it can block such connection.

14
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,030
Therefore, even when a home
computer has been compromised,

15
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,960
it cannot participate
in botnet activities.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,300
As an example, these services
are typically not allowed, but

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,490
a personal firewall can selectively
enable any of these services.
