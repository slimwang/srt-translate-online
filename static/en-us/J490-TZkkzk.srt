1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,760
Try moving between applications
on your phone or emulator.

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,730
You can watch some big ones,
like the browser or Google Maps and

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,480
some comparatively small ones,
like the calculator.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,120
Android will kill background
applications as needed and

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,829
your apps should be ready for this.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,012
The very last lifecycle method you
will get in these cases is on stop,

7
00:00:18,013 --> 00:00:20,440
i.e, you won't ever get on destroy.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,450
Try to reproduce this with
our lifecycle app and

9
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:24,259
you'll find it's pretty hard to do.

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,420
Our lifecycle app is tiny, so
Android won't prioritize killing it off.

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,060
It's only going to do
that if the device or

12
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:32,539
emulator is under
extreme memory pressure.

13
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:34,829
Let's take a closer look at
how you should prepare for

14
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,239
an untimely app death.
