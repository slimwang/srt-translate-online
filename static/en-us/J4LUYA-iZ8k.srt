1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,560
By now you should have a clear
picture of the key differences

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,580
between chronic and acute diseases.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,600
Unlike acute medical problems,

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,660
chronic diseases are more often caused
by behavior, generally can't be cured.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,000
And particularly if not well managed
can cause other chronic diseases and

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,860
complications that are difficult and
expensive to treat.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,680
Now with Marla's help,
we'll turn again to what for

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,680
our purposes is probably the key issue
with respect to chronic disease.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,299
Though they're very common,

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,100
our healthcare system is not
well designed to manage them.
