1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is there is always exactly 1.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
For any message ciphertext pair, there is one key that maps that message to that ciphertext.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We can see that thinking about the nature of the one-time pad.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Suppose we just have 1-bit messages.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We have messages 0 and 1.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Then the key 0 will map 0 to 0.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The key 1 will map 1 to 0. The key 0 will map 1 to 1.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This works for any length message and any length key.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Note that the length of the key and the length of the message scale the same way.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If we had 2-bit messages there would be four different keys

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that would map each message to each different ciphertext.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If we had 2-bit messages, there would also be one key

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
that maps each message to each different ciphertext.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
For example, the key that maps 00 to 10 would be the key 11.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That means we can compute this probability,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
summing over all the messages summing over all the keys

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
where we've got the probability that that key encrypts that message to the given ciphertext.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We need to divide this by the space, which is the size of the messages

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
times the size of the keys.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now whats the value of the summation?

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We know for a given message there is exactly one key that maps it to that ciphertext.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is one, and we're summing over all the messages,

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
summing the value of 1.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That means we're going to get the number of messages divided by

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
the number of messages times the number of keys.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's equal to 1 over the number of keys.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's the probability of event B, which is probability

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
that some message encrypts to some key.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Notice this is computed over all the messages.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's over the distribution.
