00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,278
You've now seen two loops, the while loop and the for loop. And now, you have

2
00:00:04,278 --> 00:00:10,264
choices and which loop to take, and choices aren't always easy. So, let's look

3
00:00:10,264 --> 00:00:18,529
at a typical problem. Let's say we have $10,000, and we get 10% interest. And

4
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:23,345
we want to know what happens to our nest egg over a period of 30 years. Which

5
00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:27,444
loop should we take? Now, in this case, what's going to drive our decision is

6
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:32,744
the fact that we know we want to do something 30 times. And when you know how

7
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:37,758
often you want to do it, then the for loop is what you want to choose. Over

8
00:00:37,758 --> 00:00:42,966
here, I've modified our program to do this. Here you see now I've changed the

9
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:48,334
balance to 10,000. I've changed the interest rate to 10%. And I have now that I

10
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:53,396
want 30 years. And then, I just write my loop here, where the year goes from

11
00:00:53,396 --> 00:00:58,790
one to the numberOfYears, gets incremented every time. And inside here, you

12
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,500
have the familiar computation of the interest. So, notice that in this loop, I

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,220
know exactly how many times the loop is going to execute, namely, this many

14
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:13,631
times, 30 times. Let me run the program. Here you see the output. You see the

15
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:19,050
interest, and starting at 1, scrolled off at the top, and it went 30 times.

16
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,210
That's the classic case for the for loop. Contrast that with, the example of,

17
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,088
the first program that we had, where we wanted to become a millionaire. At that

18
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,805
point, we used a while loop, because we did not know how many years it was

19
00:01:31,805 --> 00:01:37,021
going to take for us to achieve our lofty goal. When you don't know how many

20
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:41,007
iterations you want, the while loop tends to be the better choice. So, that

21
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:45,530
simply is your criterion for decision. Do you know how many times the loop

22
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,542
runs? You usually choose a for loop. If you don't know, you usually choose a

23
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,560
while loop.
