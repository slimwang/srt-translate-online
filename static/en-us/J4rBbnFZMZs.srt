00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,043
Now that we've factored, I'm interested in, how this factoring splits up our

2
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:08,260
number line. So were going to work toward completing this table. And I'ld like

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,484
you to start off by telling me what intervals, this splits our number line into,

4
00:00:12,484 --> 00:00:17,022
and then also write in the critical values of x right here. At which the splits

5
00:00:17,022 --> 00:00:21,939
happen. For the purposes of defining these intervals in values of x, don't

6
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:25,507
include these two endpoints inside these intervals.
