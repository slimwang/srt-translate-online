00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,831
Oftentimes you will want to gather input from a user and you'll give the user

2
00:00:03,831 --> 00:00:08,996
instructions such as, please enter a value less than 100. The user then may do

3
00:00:08,996 --> 00:00:13,664
something wrong, as users sometimes do. So, here we have someone disregarding

4
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:19,000
the instruction and now what do you do? often times what you do is you simply,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,950
politely ask again and the user might still get it wrong not understanding that

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:30,593
less than 100 means less than 100. So, you'd ask again. And now finally, the

7
00:00:30,593 --> 00:00:33,928
user gets it right. This is a very common situation, and it turns out to be

8
00:00:33,928 --> 00:00:38,635
surprisingly difficult to program. Here are two possible solutions to this, the

9
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:44,274
blue one and the black one. And, I'd like you to look at both of them and see

10
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:49,202
which one would work. Take your time, and tell me, is the blue one the right

11
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:53,719
one? The black one, do both work? Or does neither of them work?
