00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,810
To summarize, the advantage of callbacks is that the component can

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,880
provide a structured regime of calling within which the client executes.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,230
The regime can orchestrate the order of operations in a way that the client

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,050
would have to do by itself using the tradi, using a traditional approach.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,120
For example, the regime might provide an event loop.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,870
The cost of using callbacks is that the component state is exposed to

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,940
the client at a time when it might not be internally consistent.

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,400
That is, using callbacks makes it more difficult for

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,180
components to guarantee their integrity.
