00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We had another question that was on version control

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and what it is and which ones you should use,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
because there are quite a few out there. >>Okay, sure.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is purely subjective answer, but that's why you're here, I guess, right?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I use get. I would recommended everybody use Git.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's really, really nice.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I used CVS back in the day and then Subversion replaced that.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Then Mecurio replaced that and now I use Git and that's great.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Basically the whole notion is you have the source directory

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and you're making changes to files and you can log what those changes are,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
what they were for, you can go back in history, you can merge changes together,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
you can be working with multiple people and merge your changes together.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So it's a great way to share code between multiple computers.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's a great way to keep track of your development.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I do it. For example, in Udacity I've got a Git project for all the files I'm using

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
for you guys, for my blog.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Occasionally I have these different branches for different homework,

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
so I can be recording unit 6 and then working on homework 3.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I can switch between those two states of the code really easily,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and then I can check out the homework 3 branch and tar it up and put it online for you guys.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Then I can go back into the future to homework 6, that sort of thing.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's really handy, and it's very fast. It's really good.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It was written by a Linus Torvalds who also wrote Linux.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He's a pretty competent guy. >>Probably.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I would suggest Git. You can use Git Hub.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Git Hub is like a third-party cipher storing a code if you want to store it in a remote location.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We use Git Hub for Hipmunk, for example, and Reddit, incidentally.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There you go. Short answer is Git.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If somebody tells you different, raise an eyebrow. >>Great.
