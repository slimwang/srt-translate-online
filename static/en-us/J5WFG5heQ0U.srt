1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,670
You started down a new path
in the world of programming.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,130
And you've probably faced
some bumps in the road.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,900
But just stop and
realize that you're still here.

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,680
So now's your chance to evaluate
where you want to go next.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,540
In this course, we're going to show
you four different paths you can take.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,800
You'll learn more about front end
programming, and back end programming.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,030
As well as mobile programming,
and data analysis.
