1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's my solution.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I put the strategies into a list because

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
we're going to be indexing into that.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I start out in the start state.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Nothing has happened. No points awarded.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Player number 0, that is "Player A,"

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
is the player to move. Then I repeat this loop.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Tell me everything I know about the current state.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If the score of the player whose turn it is,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
is greater than the goal, then that player wins.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
"Player 0" or "Player 1"--"A" or "B."

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Same if the other player is greater than the goal,

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
then that player wins and, otherwise, I pick out the

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
strategy function for the player to play.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If "P" is "0," then strategy "0" is "A."

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If "P" is "1," then strategy "1" is "B."

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Apply that strategy function to the state

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and if it's whole, I apply the hold action to the state to get a new state.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Otherwise, I assume that the strategy function is legal,

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and if it doesn't return whole, then it does return roll.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll give it the benefit of the doubt there, and perform the roll action

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
on the state and on a random integer from 1 to 6, inclusive.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That will give me the new state, and I continue until we find a winner.
