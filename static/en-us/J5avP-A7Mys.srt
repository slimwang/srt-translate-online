1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,970
Now, the first 1 is actually quite trivial; so first of all, vertex cover is a minimization problem,

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,210
so we're looking for a vertex cover that is as small as possible.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,080
Now, if the algorithm already finds one with 100 vertices,

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,790
then that means, in an optimum solution, there cannot be more than 100 vertices.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,300
Because we already know that there's a vertex cover of that size,

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,490
the optimum solution might be smaller, but it will certainly not be bigger.

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,290
Now here comes the interesting part. So we just said vertex cover

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,960
is a minimization problem, which means if you have a factor-2 approximation algorithm,

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,040
then the solution that we found, and we found a solution with 100 vertices,

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,960
is â‰¤ 2 x the size of an optimum solution.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,520
Which means if you solve this equation, that the optimum

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,010
is at least as big as 100/2, or 50.

13
00:00:47,010 --> 99:59:59,999
So the minimum number of vertices in an optimum solution is 50.
