00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,120
In this last programming assignment before the final project,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,910
I've added two new spouts.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,500
The MyLikeSpout and MyNameSpout.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,815
You will update the exclamation topology and

5
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:13,600
ExclamationBolt to process these two spouts.

6
00:00:14,608 --> 00:00:18,210
Your new ExclamationBolt will create a dictionary of

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,520
key value pairs that are received from the MyLikeSpout.

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,120
And emit a sentence appended with three exclamation points when a name or

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,170
key is received from the MyNamesSpout.

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,380
In Part 0, navigate to Lesson 3, Stage 6.

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,410
And in part 1 initially both spouts emit similar tuple schemas of string.

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,700
Import both spouts and add them topology.

13
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:45,820
In part 2, connect the ReportBolt to the exclaim1 bolt and

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,350
remember that you must modify the ReportBolt to make this connection.

15
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,360
I've used an integer count of 30 and

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,468
remember that this count changes the text size of the visualization.

17
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:59,230
In part 3, without modifying the ExclamationBolt yet, use two shuffle groupings

18
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,730
to join and connect to exclaim one, build and submit your visualization.

19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,530
Once completed with part 3, your visualization will have names and

20
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,870
name favorite pairs, but they're not connected.

21
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:15,000
So, in part four we modify the like spout to emit name and

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,230
favorites instead of pair.

23
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,598
Also remember that this requires the declaration output fields to be updated.

24
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:25,760
In part 5, modify the ExclamationBolt to dynamically create a favoritesMap when

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,650
a name, favorites tuple is received from your MyLikesSpout.

26
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,160
I also give you a few syntax hints if you need them in the written instructions.

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,470
Next, if a tuple from the MyNamesSpout is received,

28
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,300
check your favoritesMap that you've created and see if it exists, and

29
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,400
if so, emit the sentence, NAME's favorite is FOURITE.

30
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,410
Append three exclamation marks to the end of your sentence and build and

31
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,160
run your topology.

32
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,250
Once your basic visualization is running with name and

33
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,710
favorites dynamically joined using a streaming join and

34
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,780
three exclamation marks appended, it's time to move on to stage six.

35
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,688
Connect your ReportBolt to exclaim2.

36
00:02:05,688 --> 00:02:09,590
Modify the ExclamationBolt again to append three more exclamation points for

37
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,590
a total of six.

38
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,560
Finally, build and submit your visualization.

39
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,350
After your visualization is running and

40
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,090
six exclamation marks are appended at the end of your sentences,

41
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,540
all using the single ExclamationBolt, in step seven, simply change

42
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,060
the my like spout and my name spout to omit names and favorites of your own.

43
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,450
Or change the ExclamationBolt as well to omit sentences of your choice.

44
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,870
And finally if you like, take a final screen shot or

45
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,550
video and post it to the forum.

46
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,260
Comment on two other posts and how about posting to your Twitter followers.

47
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,100
Good luck with this final programming assignment.
