1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,195
It takes the boat 6 hours to go downstream so we know what this corresponding

2
00:00:04,195 --> 00:00:08,720
time must be 6. We know the speed of the boat going downstream is faster with a

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,622
current so we'll have the speed of the boat, which is x. And then we'll add the

4
00:00:13,622 --> 00:00:17,495
current which is 12. The return trip for the boat is going to be 8 hours so for

5
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:22,484
upstream or going against the current we'll have eight for the time. The speed

6
00:00:22,484 --> 00:00:26,839
of the boat against the current will be x minus 12. We'll have the speed of the

7
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:30,493
boat which is x and then we'll have to subtract off the current speed which is

8
00:00:30,493 --> 00:00:36,251
12. And here's what's different about this problem. We don't know the distances

9
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:41,019
going upstream or downstream. We'll need expressions for each of these. The

10
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:45,764
distance is equal to rate times time. So when going upstream the boat's

11
00:00:45,764 --> 00:00:51,984
distance would be x minus 12, the rate times 8, the time. And when going

12
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:57,834
downstream we'll have the rate x plus 12 times the time which is 6. This is our

13
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:02,013
complete table with all the information we need. And if we want we go ahead and

14
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:06,748
simplify each of these expressions. When we distribute the eight, we'll have 8x

15
00:01:06,748 --> 00:01:12,598
minus 96 for the first one. And we distribute the six, we'll have 6x plus 72

16
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:14,179
here.
