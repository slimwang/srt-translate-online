1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,250
In the previous lessons,

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:05,040
we discussed several mechanisms for
Inter-process Communication.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,280
But we said that these were fairly
low-level mechanisms because

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,090
they focused on providing
the basic capability for

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,820
moving data among address spaces.

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,990
And didn't really specify anything about
the semantics of those operations or

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,630
the protocols that are involved.

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,650
In this lesson we will talk about
Remote Procedure Calls, or RPC.

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,630
This is an IPC mechanism

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:30,830
that specifies that the processes
interact via procedure call interface.

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,440
For the general discussion of RPCs,
we will roughly follow Birrell and

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,670
Nelson's paper,
Implementing Remote Procedure Calls.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,280
This is an older paper, but

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,660
it discusses very nicely
the general design space of RPC.

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,510
Then, we will discuss
in more detail Sun RPC.

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,340
It's a concrete implementation
of an RPC system,

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,090
that's common in
operating systems today.
