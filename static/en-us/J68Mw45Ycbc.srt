00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,920
Google Maps is a powerful site.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,620
And you probably use it often.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,480
But I want you to take a step back and

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,920
think about this as
a single page application.

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,460
Frameworks and single page applications
have a lot of moving parts.

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,265
Sometimes it can be tough to see how
the pieces interact with each other.

7
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:18,035
With that in mind, for this quiz,

8
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:21,755
I want you to look for
what makes the URL change.

9
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,605
Where templates are used.

10
00:00:23,605 --> 00:00:26,095
And what events are fired
while working with the map.

11
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:26,955
Write down what you find.
