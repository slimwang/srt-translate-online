00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,730
During this lesson, we focused on the map reduced

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,770
programming model. A very common open source implementation of

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,280
the map reduce programming model is HADOOP. HADOOP couples

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,000
the map reduce programming model with a distributed file system.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,630
In order to more easily allow programmers to complete

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,070
complicated tasks using the processing power of HADOOP, there

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,720
are many infrastructures out there that either built on

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,550
top of HADOOP, Or allow data access via Hadoop. Two

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,550
of the most common are Hive and Pig. Hive was

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,280
initially developed by FaceBook, and one of its biggest selling

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,770
points is that it allows you to run map-produced jobs

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,410
through a sequel-like querying language, called the Hive Query Language.

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,130
Pig was originally developed at Yahoo! And excels in some

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,160
areas Hive does not. Pig jobs are written in a

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,410
procedural language called pig Latin. This wins you a bunch

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,620
of things. Among them are the ability to be more explicit

17
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,420
about the execution of your data processing. Which

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,940
is not possible in a declarative language like sequel

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,750
syntax. And also the ability to split your data

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,900
pipeline. Hive and Pig are two of the most

21
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,960
common Hadoop-based products, but there are a bunch

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,070
of them out there. For example Mahout for machine

23
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,710
learning, Giraph for graph analysis, and Cassandra, a hybrid

24
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,040
of a key value and a column oriented database.
