00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,916
Declarative memory is a broad term which can include both episodic and semantic

2
00:00:04,916 --> 00:00:09,950
memory. An easy way to remember declarative memory, is that you declare or

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:15,514
communicate your memory to another. For example, in 1492 Columbus sailed the

4
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:19,635
ocean blue. That is a declarative tidbit that some of you may have learned in

5
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:25,002
school. Two other distinctions in the types of memory are explicit memory and

6
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:29,890
implicit memory. Some psychologists refer to declarative memory as a type of

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,642
explicit memory. Again, this is our ability to consciously recall facts and

8
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:40,286
events. So we would say in some cases, that semantic and episodic memories are

9
00:00:40,286 --> 00:00:45,204
types of explicit memory. We're able to describe and recall events and things

10
00:00:45,204 --> 00:00:49,935
that we've learned in the past. Now let's go take a closer look at implicit

11
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:50,630
memory.
