1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,650
So let's recap what we've talked about today. We started off today by

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,590
talking about one of the most important concepts in all of knowledge based AI,

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,510
which are knowledge based representations. As we go forward in this class,

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,780
we'll see knowledge representations are really at the heart of nearly everything

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,610
we'll do. We then talked about semantic networks, which are a good particular

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,270
kind of [UNKNOWN] representation and we used those to talk about the different

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,210
criteria for a good knowledge representation. What do good knowledge

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,260
representations enable us to do and what to they help us avoid? We then talked

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,400
about kind of an abstract class of problem solving methods called Represent and

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,170
Reason. Represent and reason really lies under all of knowledge based AI and

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,020
it's a way of representing knowledge and then reasoning over it.

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,940
We then talked a little bit about augmenting that with weight, which allows us

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,290
to come to more nuanced and specific conclusions. In the next couple weeks, we

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,020
are going to use these semantic networks to talk about a few different problem

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,770
solving methods. Next time, we'll talk about generating tests and

16
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,410
then we'll move on to a couple slightly different ones called Means and

17
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,940
Analysis and Proper Reduction.
