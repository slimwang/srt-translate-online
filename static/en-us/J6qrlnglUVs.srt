00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,212
To draw a straight line, we only need 2 points. We have point a and we have some

2
00:00:04,224 --> 00:00:08,349
other point, then the shortest path between them, is just a straight line. If we

3
00:00:08,361 --> 00:00:12,428
had just 1 point on its own, we wouldn't know what direction to draw the line

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,731
in, unless we had another point that we knew we needed to aim toward. If we want

5
00:00:16,743 --> 00:00:20,843
to check that this actually the line that we were looking for, however, we need

6
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:25,750
1 more point that supposedly lies on the line, to check that this is the correct

7
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:30,257
line. So, we need 3 points, if we want to check our original line. So, maybe

8
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,650
this point right here, is the third point that I had in addition to these two.

9
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:39,171
We can see if the original line I was starting to draw goes through this point

10
00:00:39,183 --> 00:00:43,680
as well. And voila, we have one continuous beautiful line. Let's say, for

11
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:48,355
example, that I had 3 points, and I thought that they all lay on the same line,

12
00:00:48,457 --> 00:00:53,005
because I thought that I had done my xy table correctly. Unfortunately, when I

13
00:00:53,017 --> 00:00:57,380
bring my ruler into the picture, there is no way that I can get a line that I

14
00:00:57,392 --> 00:01:01,517
would draw along my ruler to contain all 3 of these points. So clearly, one of

15
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:05,412
my coordinates must be messed up. So, a lot of the time, just to be safe, it's

16
00:01:05,424 --> 00:01:09,460
great to have 3 points that you think satisfy your equation, just to make sure

17
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:10,586
your graph is correct.
