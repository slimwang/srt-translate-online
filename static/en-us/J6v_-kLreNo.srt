00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,556
First we're going to find every deviation from the respective sample mean, and

2
00:00:04,556 --> 00:00:10,111
then we'll square each deviation. Then, we can find each sum of squares for

3
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:16,114
each sample and then, we add up each sum of squares. In this case, we get 862.

00:00:16,114 --> 00:00:18,539
Great job, this was the hard part.
