00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,379
Lauren's right. Now, we're going to move on and talk about the Central Nervous

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:09,736
System Depressants or CNS Depressants. These include the Barbiturates, the

3
00:00:09,736 --> 00:00:15,143
Benzodiazepines, and alcohol. The CNS Depressants slow activity in the Central

4
00:00:15,143 --> 00:00:19,767
Nervous System, and the Benzodiazepines and Barbiturates are used medically to

5
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:26,066
treat anxiety, as well as insomnia. In general, the benzodiazepines and

6
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:31,052
barbituates produces effects that are similar to alcohol. In fact, these three

7
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:35,910
drug types are behavioral, motor, and cognitive inhibitors. A person may

8
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,250
respond to a low dose with feelings of relaxation or decreased anxiety.

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,352
However, in some people that same dose can produce aggressive and even violent

10
00:00:44,352 --> 00:00:50,520
behavior. In general, the CNS to presence can cause motor impairment, cognitive

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,910
impairment, slurred speech, disorientation, mental confusion and even amnesia.

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,842
We're going to send it back to Lauren to talk about these three drug types.
