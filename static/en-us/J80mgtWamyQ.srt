1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,030
Now, you see we have a parseJSON function that takes a string of JSON in, and

2
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:12,345
then we're going to parse it using the JSON.parse method that is included in and

3
00:00:12,357 --> 00:00:18,405
accessible in just about any modern browser. JSON.parse takes this string,

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,938
Weapon.JSON in and will return a JavaScript object representing the JSON that it's

5
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:29,846
parsed. Now, once we've done that what I want you to do is grab a specific piece

6
00:00:29,892 --> 00:00:36,351
of data, from that JSON. Let's say you want to grab data from the JavaScript

7
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:40,084
object returned from JSON.parse and let's say you put that JavaScript object

8
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:46,117
into the variable "parsed". Now in order to grab the chaingun sub object then

9
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:52,286
you'd simply say parsed frames chaingun.png like so and then put it in the

10
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:56,559
variable chaingun lets say. Now lets take a look up above at this structure.

11
00:00:56,675 --> 00:01:01,961
What I would do, it'd walk down first on frames and then in the chaingun

12
00:01:01,973 --> 00:01:07,773
and what would be stored in the chaingun variable, would then be this entire

13
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:13,345
structure, so everything inside of chaingun.png. Now what I would like you to

14
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:21,371
do, is grab the x data field inside spriteSourceSize of chaingun_impact.png

15
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:26,223
and go ahead and print that out to the console. chaingun_impact.png isn't up in

16
00:01:26,235 --> 00:01:30,899
our example JSON, but the JSON that we'll be running through this function

17
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:32,007
does have it.
