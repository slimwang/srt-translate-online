00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,676
The code itself is pretty straightforward. We set the vertex positions then

2
00:00:03,676 --> 00:00:07,420
make a triangle face. Nothing fancy there. We then create the three colors red,

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,907
green and blue. Finally an array of these three colors is assigned to the face

4
00:00:10,907 --> 00:00:14,452
itself. One thing worth noting is that these vertex colors are actually

5
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:18,212
multiplied by the materials color when displayed. Since the material color is

6
00:00:18,212 --> 00:00:21,116
by default a solid white it doesn't have a noticeable effect in this particular

7
00:00:21,116 --> 00:00:22,279
case.
