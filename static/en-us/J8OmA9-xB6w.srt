1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,650
Recall that the power in a computing
system has, roughly speaking, two parts.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,040
The first is constant power, which is
what you pay just to keep the system on.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,400
The other part is dynamic power.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,540
That's what you pay above and

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,650
beyond constant power while
the program is running.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,925
Let's take a quick look at some of
the basic circuits 101 drivers underlie

7
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:21,290
dynamic power.

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,950
Imagine a simple logic gate,
taken out of a larger circuit.

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,250
This gate has a certain
amount of physical energy.

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,710
It is both right and natural to
represent that energy by analogy

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,250
to a snifter of mighty fine
Atlanta-based beverage.

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,120
Quick extra credit if you
can name this brewery.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,620
Now suppose a gate input changes.

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,180
Then the energy dissipates and also,
quite naturally, has to be refilled.

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,970
But differently when the circuit
switches there will be some energy loss.

16
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,590
This energy loss then
has to be restored.

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,950
Let's first ask how
much energy that is and

18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,800
then ask how frequently
this switching happens.

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,090
Let's see how to compute dynamic power.

20
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,310
Start with the amount of energy consumed
by this gate during a state change.

21
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:08,680
In electrical engineering terms
C is the gate's capacitance.

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,190
Capacitance is a function of
the material properties and

23
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,280
geometry of the gate.

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,420
V is the supply voltage.

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,830
Supply voltage is part
of a circuit design.

26
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,290
it can, for some circuits,
be tuned over some range.

27
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,860
More importantly is how V
enters into the equation.

28
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,760
It enters as the square.

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,000
Now for our class, it's not too
important to understand exactly where

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,680
this relationship comes from.

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,850
But do remember that the product
CV squared quantifies energy.

32
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,000
So how often does switching happen?

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,380
Well there are two factors.

34
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,410
The first is the frequency or
clock rate of the circuit.

35
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,980
It has units of cycles per unit time.

36
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,420
The clock rate determines the maximum
number of times that the circuit can

37
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,820
switch or change states per unit time.

38
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,950
Now the gate doesn't necessarily
switch on every cycle.

39
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,930
Depending on what
the computation is doing,

40
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,610
the switches might happen
only once ever few cycles.

41
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,010
That brings us to the second factor,
which is the activity factor.

42
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,290
It's the number of switches per cycle.

43
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,318
If you think about how a clock works,
it has a maximum value of one.

44
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,270
In general, it will depend on
what the computation is doing.

45
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,360
Taken together, these parameters tell
us how to compute dynamic power.

46
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,330
It's basically the energy per gate, or

47
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,490
CV squared,
times the switching frequency.

48
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,560
Which is a times F.

49
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,450
This formula is sometimes called
the Dynamic Power Equation.

50
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,620
Before moving on, let me give you
one more quick fact about it.

51
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,060
The clock rate, F and
the supply voltage,

52
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,340
V usually need to be kept in
proportion to one another.

53
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,710
That is, suppose you've cut F in half.

54
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,870
Then you also need to cut V in half.

55
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,740
Increases are the same.

56
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,010
Suppose you increase F by two.

57
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,780
Then you also need to double V.

58
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,310
So why do F and
V need to change together?

59
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,470
The short story is that it has to do
with maintaining the stability and

60
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,290
reliability of the circuit.

61
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,390
In particular, its Its reliability in
the presence of environmental noise.

62
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,319
Okay, now's a good time to pause and

63
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,117
see if you can understand what this
this formula implies can be done if you

64
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:07,937
want to increase performance
while reducing power.
