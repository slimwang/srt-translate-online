1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Assume that this is the curve that describes

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
the dependence of position on time.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What would be the curve that describes the

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
dependence of velocity x dot on time--

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the red one, the green one, the purple one--

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and this is getting a little more complex.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Assume that this is again a curve that describes

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the dependence of position on time.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What about the second derivative?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If you repeat that same process again--

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the derivative of the derivative,

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the rate of change of the rate of change--

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that's nothing but acceleration.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How quickly does velocity change?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So what would the acceleration be on the red curve--

17
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the green curve or the purple curve.
