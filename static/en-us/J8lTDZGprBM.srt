1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm going to go ahead and add that function to our program here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Actually, this one works verbatim just like out of the quiz.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now if we give it a list of points, it will return the URL for the image. Let's go ahead and use that.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If we have any coordinates, make a URL image.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We've already implemented that function. Let's go ahead and move our comment.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now we just need to display the image URL.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Actually, we need to make one little change here-- img_url = None.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If by default doesn't exist and if we actually have some points, we can set it to something else.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Then we just need to pass img<u>url into our template--img</u>url = img_url.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now we just need to update our template, and we're going to insert our image.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Remember, this is our template. I had a bunch of CSS.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Remember I explained that kind of controls the layout of things.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Then we have all of our HTML. Here is our form.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We want to display this to the right of our form.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm going to do somethings you haven't seen before in terms of getting it to display right,

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but first let's just get the image in here.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If img_url--so basically it's not None--include our image.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is how we do that in the Jinja template language.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Again, I know we haven't covered this in this class, but it's fairly straightforward.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You just have some text, and you have these little escapes for actually running Python code.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If the URL is there, include this image. Let's give this a whirl.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I reloaded the page, and you can see below the form we have an image with a marker on it.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Pretty cool, huh? Let's get our image displayed off to the right here.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm just going to go ahead and do that, and I'll explain briefly how it's done.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I've moved the image over here. I'll show you briefly what I did to do that.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I added a class to map, so I can refer to it in my CSS.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You can use this notion of position absolute,

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
which allows you to position something anywhere on the page.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I positioned absolute the map to be zero pixels from the right and 112 pixels from the top--

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
zero from the right, 112 from the top. It fits perfectly.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Obviously, I knew the size of the image beforehand when we did this whole URL thing.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's see if our program works. Remember we've got this hack in here forcing our IP.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We're going to have to--probably if we're going to develop this long-term,

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
maybe when it's in debug mode it'll chose from some random IPs or something like that,

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
but when we put it into production it is going to use the real IP.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Right now, we're just going to hard code some IPs so this actually works in the demo.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll go ahead and include Udacity's office IP, and we'll submit some ASCII art.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We'll have this IP, and let's make sure things work.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's add a picture of a rabbit.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We'll past that in or we'll draw it by hand, whichever you're faster at.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We submit this--ta-da!

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It took a little longer to submit because we had to look up the IP,

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
but now we can see that we used our office IP, which is down here in Palo Alto.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We have our old IP from that other IP we faked, which in here in Colorado,

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and we can see our rabbit and our cat. Our camel didn't have a location.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now ASCII Chan is much more worldly.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll put this online at asciichan.com, and you call can submit all the ASCII art you love to do.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We'll see how this map goes. That's it for this lesson.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I how you learned something about how to interact with other websites.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,495
Good luck on the homeworks.
