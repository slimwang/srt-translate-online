1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, I'd like to ask you about random walks.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:13,000
These are really interesting things that show up in everything from finance to physics,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but amazingly they're the exact same thing you learned about when you learned about

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
when you learned how to manipulate normal distributions.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's assume we have some object--it could be me,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
it could be a point, it could be an insect,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
it could be a particle in a fluid--

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
sitting right here at position 0.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now, let's assume that it moves every second in a normally distributed way.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Its movement has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Note that in this case the variance and the standard deviation are actually the same

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
since they're both 1.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What I'd like to ask you is after 1 second tell me what the mean

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and standard deviation of the object's position is.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please tell me the object's mean position and the variance of that position.
