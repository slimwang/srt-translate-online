To work out your brain a little, say, we have two coordinate systems with the

2
00:00:04,627 --> 00:00:09,830
same origin. The first uses the architect's scheme, X goes east, Y goes north, Z

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:15,151
goes up. The second uses minrcraft's current system of X goes east, Y goes up,

4
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:20,566
and Z goes south. If I have a point 10, 24, 13 in the architect's system, what

5
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:24,430
is this point's location in the minecraft's system?
