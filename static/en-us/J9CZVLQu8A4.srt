1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is 25.2.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The line of 25.2 + 0.67x = y.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This line over here is linear regression to the data.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Pictorially, this is the line just like this.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It might be hard to see as my shift of units, this is really 50 and this is 120.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
When you work this out, this line hits the y axis at 25.2,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and it's steepness when it goes one step right, it goes 0.67 steps up vertically,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
which is off the line.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We just did the following: we inspected a data sample with two dimensions,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and we saw it had massive outliers.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We removed the outliers using a very context-dependent method of just thresholding.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We calculated some basic statistics, such as the mean, the standard deviation, and the covariance.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Then we came to the meat of the unit.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We computed the correlation and the regression,

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and those two things were the primary result of the step,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
but they would not have been possible without the initial steps of cleaning up the data.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I hope we got those right.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If you did, you are a very capable statistician at this point.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This is a very typical question that arises in statistics

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and getting it correct means you have a fairly deep understanding of something

21
00:01:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
really nontrivial that comes up in statistics. Congratulations.
