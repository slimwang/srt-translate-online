00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,560
Next, I want to talk about the
difference between + and += in NumPy.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,450
Before I tell you what
the difference is,

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,720
I want you to think about what
you expect the difference to be.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,080
Look at these two code snippets, which
are the same, except that one says a +=

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,660
this array and
the other says a = a + this array.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,000
For each code snippet, select what
you think its output will be.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,464
Your options are the array([1, 2,
3, 4]), the array([2, 3, 4, 5]),

8
00:00:28,464 --> 00:00:31,120
or the code will produce an error.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,640
If you're not sure you can
either take your best guess or

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,270
you can try it and see.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,290
The important thing is not getting
this right on the first try but

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,930
that you learn the answer for
the future.
