00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,250
Another view which you may not have previously thought of

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,480
as a view is I call the book reporting view.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,330
If you've got a, a system you're developing most shops will have some kind of

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,380
tool for reporting bugs.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,880
These are bugs during development or

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,980
these are bugs after delivery, and those bug reporting tools often have fields

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,640
which you fill in which indicate which component does the bug relate to.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,190
I'm suggesting that those components had better correspond to the architectural

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,220
components in your other views otherwise there's the potential for

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,189
some kind of confusion.

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,630
Okay?

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,850
Similarly, with respect to features, you would like

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,300
the person who's handling the bug to be aware of, well, this particular bug

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,740
arose when the following feature was being used by the, by the user.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,580
Here's a screen capture from a get based web browser

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,790
interface into a source control system in which bugs are being listed with

17
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,935
respect to a particular component of that system.
