I happen to love the game, Minecraft, along with a few other million people.

2
00:00:03,748 --> 00:00:07,952
Yes, I built the teapot in the game. I even wrote a program to help me print 3D

3
00:00:07,952 --> 00:00:12,458
models in Minecraft. But really, no, I'm not addicted at all. One confusing

4
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:17,114
thing in the game is the coordinate system. In the beta version of Minecraft,

5
00:00:17,114 --> 00:00:22,675
the coordinate system was as follows, the X-axis points south, Z pointed west, Y

6
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:26,484
points up. You could tell these where the axis directions because in the game,

7
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:30,304
their sun rose in the east. When the game was released the developers changed

8
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:34,380
the direction the sun moved. The sun started rising and what I used to think of

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,424
was the south but was now considered the east. In other words, in release, the

10
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:45,400
X-axis now points east, Z points south, and Y points up. So, what handedness are

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,823
the beta and the release coordinate systems, right-handed or left-handed?
