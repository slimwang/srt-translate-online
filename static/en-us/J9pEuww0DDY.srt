1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,900
The answer as to which way you should work

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,180
it is, well it all depends, that there is

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,660
no real correct answer. because it's possible for your

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,980
home to work with either model. If the thermostat determines

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,260
how hot the heater is, then the first answer

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,530
is correct. you know, set it high first. That'll

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,830
get you to the correct temperature as quickly as

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,920
possible. But, you know, that's not how most homes work.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,100
In most homes, the second answer is correct, because

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,020
the home heater either turns all the way on, or

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,670
all the way off. We call that bang, bang

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,420
control, all the way one way or all the way

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,870
the other. The thermostat turns the heat on full

14
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,760
until it reaches the set point, at which point it

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,590
turns it off. So, setting the temperature too high doesn't

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,330
do any good. It doesn't speed things up and worse,

17
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,230
if you forget to turn it back, well the house keeps getting hotter and

18
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,970
hotter and hotter. Wasting energy and maybe

19
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,370
making you uncomfortable by now being too hot.
