00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,220
Now going back to our mani-core challenges we have

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,870
seen that the number of cores as it grows

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,030
makes the coherence traffic grow and we looked at

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,190
solutions to deal with that. We then looked at

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,180
the problem of the off-chip traffic also growing with

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,680
the number of cores. And we just saw that

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,120
a large shared but distributed last level cache can

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,170
help with this problem. The next problem we face

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,598
is that the coherence directory that we need is just way too large to fit

10
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:36,150
on-chip. Because we have a scalable on-chip network and no longer a

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,340
bus, we need directory coherence. But a

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,820
traditional directory has one entry for each

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,680
possible memory block. The memory can be

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,410
many gigabytes in size. That might require

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,130
even billions of directory entries and that won't fit

16
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,750
on chip. So how do we deal with that problem?
