1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,590
Now you know how to get data out of

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,410
a variety of sources. In this lesson we're going to

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,120
focus on the data itself. How good is it?

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,150
Can it be trusted? Is it reliable? We're going to

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,290
look at a blueprint for auditing our data to

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,370
assess it's quality, and we'll look at a number of

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,440
different quality measures. We'll also look at ways of

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,770
cleaning our data to correct any problems that we find

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,880
with it. As we'll see, this is a process

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,880
that's very situation specific. But even so, we can

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,950
identify a number of rules of thumb and best

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,410
practices that apply in a variety of different contexts.
