1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,930
Alright, so now let's, let's get back to our data set that

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,250
we were looking at before. So again, the ideas that we're, we're going to

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,830
try to find a way of predicting the value for various points along

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,770
the way on this curve. And one thing we could do is find

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,960
the best line. But we also talked now about finding the best constant.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,120
Turns out these all belong to a family of functions that we could

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,490
fit. Which are functions of this form. Alright. We've got x is our

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,200
input and what we're going to do is we're going to take some constant and

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,750
add that to some scaled version of x times some scaled version of x squared plus

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,190
some scaled version of x cubed, all the way up to some order k. And we've

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,710
talked about k equals zero, the constant function.

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,380
And k equals one, the line. But there's

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,570
also k equals two, parabola. Would it parabola

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,410
be a good choice at this particular case?

15
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,770
>> Yes.

16
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,900
>> It does seem like it's got, sort of, curvy downy nature, right?

17
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,108
>> Mm hm.

18
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:51,330
>> It's

19
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,440
going up and it's kind of flattening out and maybe we could

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,540
imagine that it starts coming down again? At least, over the course of

21
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,790
these points, it doesn't come down again but at least it sort of

22
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,840
flattened out. So let's take a look at that. Let's take a look

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,670
at the. The best parabola to fit this. Alright, so, so here

24
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,870
we go. We've got the, the best line now, the best constant function

25
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,850
which is just the average. We have the best line with some slope

26
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,480
to it. That's the green one. We have now the best parabola and

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,030
look at it, it does, it does a nice job,

28
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,930
right? Kind a gets, gets tucked in with all those other

29
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,720
points. so, so what do you think? Is this the

30
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,340
best way of, of capturing this. This particular set of points?

31
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,140
>> Well, if the only thing we care about is minimizing the sum of squared

32
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,490
error, my guess is that the parabola has less squared error.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,110
>> Yeah. It ha, there's more degrees of freedom so at the worst

34
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,380
we could have just fit the parabola as a line. Right.

35
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,330
We can always just set any of these coefficients to, to zero.

36
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,860
So if the best fit to this really was a line. The

37
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,410
best fit to this data point was a line, then the parabola

38
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,370
that we see here wouldn't have any curve to it. So,

39
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,693
yeah. Our errors going down. Hm, As we have gone from order

40
00:02:00,693 --> 00:02:03,960
zero to order one to order two. So can you think of

41
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,230
any other way getting there in order to getting down even more?

42
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,530
>> How about order

43
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,240
14 million.

44
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,150
>> Interesting, while in this particular case,

45
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,880
given the amount of data that we have,

46
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,520
we can't go past the number of

47
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,530
data points, yeh after that. They're really unconstrained.

48
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,180
>> Okay. Then how about order nine?

49
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,140
>> Order nine is a good idea. But just to

50
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,770
give you an idea here, we're going to step up a little

51
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,570
more. This is order four and look at, look at how

52
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,140
lovely it can actually capture the flow here. That's, very faded.

53
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,290
Order six and in fact the best we can do here is of the, of the,

54
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,960
sorry. The most, the highest order that, that

55
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,550
works is order eight. And, son of a gun,

56
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,910
look what it did. It hit every single

57
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,110
point dead on in the center. Boom. Boom. Boom.

58
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,440
Boom. It used all the degrees of freedom

59
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,950
it had to reduce the error to essentially zero.

60
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,030
>> Excellent.

61
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,910
>> So [LAUGH], one could argue that this is a really

62
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,090
good idea. Though, if you look at what happens around 9000,

63
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,960
there's some craziness. Do you see that?

64
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,220
>> I do.

65
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,510
>> At the, the To try to get this particular parabola

66
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,380
to hit that particular point, it sent the curve soaring down with an up again.

67
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:16,319
>> We also did that between 6500 and 8500, it sent [CROSSTALK].

68
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:16,888
>> Yes good point

69
00:03:16,888 --> 00:03:17,854
>> [UNKNOWN] [CROSSTALK]

70
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:23,170
>> Right, right, that's right went off the top of the plot. So Yeah,

71
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,660
that's kind of [INAUDIBLE]. But let's just, just to show that we really

72
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,320
are, as we have more degrees of freedom we're fitting the error better.

73
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,950
Let me show you what it looks like, the amount of error for

74
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,470
the best fit for each of these orders of k. Alright and so, so

75
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,370
what you see when we actually plot the, the squared error, this function

76
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,010
that we're trying to minimize. As we go from order zero to order

77
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,140
one, order two, order three, order four, order five, all the way to

78
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,710
eight. By eight, there is no error left because it nailed every single point.

79
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,930
So you know its kind of a good, nut it doesn't feel quite

80
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,540
right like the curves that we're looking there looked a little bit crazy.
