1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,830
The first thing you need to do is to
get the list of Geofences that you

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,360
may have triggered.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,610
So you can just create a list
of Geofence and call it,

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,920
triggeringGeofences.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,970
To get them,

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:16,210
the geofencingEvent has a method that
returns them in this data structure.

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,530
Check the documentation to see if
you can find it and enter it here.

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,950
When you have the list
of Geofence objects,

9
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:26,700
you'll note that each Geofence object
has a request ID associated with it.

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,040
Again, can you figure out what
the method is to return this request ID?

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,230
Now, write a helper function that
takes this list of Geofences and

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,650
concatenates all of their
IDs into a single string.

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:43,340
Call this helper function,
getGeofenceTransitionDetails.

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,600
When you're done creating it,
check this box.
