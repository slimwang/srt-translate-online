1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
But what we need to do now is consider this particular message M*.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We want to compute the probability of the intersection of those events,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that the selected message is M* and the message encrypts to C.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm going to make that a quiz and see if you can figure out what that is yourself.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Here are your choices.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
See if you can figure out what the probability of M equals M*

7
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
intersected with the encryption of M equals C.
