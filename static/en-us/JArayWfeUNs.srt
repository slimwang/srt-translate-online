1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,290
So now that we have seen that
the increasing block size can result in

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,820
reduction in the miss rate.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,490
Let's see if we understood
what's going on.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,260
So when we increase the block size,
and the locality is good.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,820
So the miss rate goes down,
the question for

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,100
you is which types of
the misses are reduced?

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,750
The compulsory misses, the capacity
misses, or the conflict misses?
