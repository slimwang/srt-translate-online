1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,020
You're not completely alone though.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:02,750
Like I mentioned,

3
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,890
many fields have already been
addressed by machine learning.

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,240
Which means there's actually
already articles and

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,390
ideas out there that
you can build off of.

6
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,920
And in fact there's certain areas where
machine learning has already been

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,480
used so much that there are even classes

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,860
on how to use machine
learning in those domains.

9
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,030
Some of those are hosted here.

10
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,800
We already have classes through the
Georgia Tech program on applying machine

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,180
learning to healthcare or trading.

12
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,900
And so if you're interested in those
domains you're welcome to use those

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,070
materials to kind of get up to speed
on how machine learning is being

14
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,740
used in those areas.

15
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,180
On the other hand there are also
materials on other websites that can get

16
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,320
you up to speed on how to use machine
learning in other domains as well.

17
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,020
Or maybe you want to choose
one that's actually just

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,100
never been addressed before.

19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,250
In which case, great,
we'd love to see what you come up with.

20
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,320
So, you're not completely
alone in this portion,

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,500
but we really want you to find a project
that's going to be interesting to you

22
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,550
that as in generate a portfolio item for
you that you'll be proud to brag about
