There is a quicker way to think about our process though. When simplifying

2
00:00:03,655 --> 00:00:08,639
radicals that involve variables, we want to remember power divided by root. For

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,608
example, if we wanted to simplify the square root of x to the fourth, we would

4
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:18,558
do the power of the 4 divided by the root 2, so we would get x squared. We're

5
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:23,600
dividing this power by our index of 2, since it's the square root. This should

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,810
also make sense because x to the 4th can be rewritten as x squared times x

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,420
squared. We have a repeated factor here so we can pull out x squared. We can

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,160
use this same approach of power divided by root for higher order roots like

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,350
cube roots, fourth roots and fifth roots. So how do you think we could simplify

10
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,343
this radical? Write your answer here.
