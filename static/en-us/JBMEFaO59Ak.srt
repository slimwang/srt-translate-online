1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,750
So, we started this course by exploring X Code.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,620
In lesson 2, we learned how to add different visual elements to our app.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,250
Things like buttons, images and label.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,360
We also learned, how to control or manipulate them, using Actions and Outlets.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,940
In this lesson, lesson three, we will accomplish, three main things.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,120
We will learn how to play, audio from our app.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,510
We will also tinker with the speed of the audio,

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,690
to make it play really fast or really slowly.

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,940
And finally, we will also figure out how to navigate between

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,050
different screens of our app.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,490
The next lesson, will be all about recording audio and

12
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,700
adding effects like chipmunk and Darth Vader
