>> It turns out, I want to shade region 2. If I plug in the values of 0 for x

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:09,686
and for y, I can see that I get 0 is less than 1. This is a true statement. So,

3
00:00:09,686 --> 00:00:14,550
I know this point satisfies this inequality. So, all of these points also

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,953
satisfy this inequaltity. Try testing some other points to be sure. You'll find

5
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,092
that they all do.
