1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,430
And as you can see, each time we add 10 to n, so 10+10=20+10=30+10=40,

2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:16,600
the probability of reaching a success decreases by well more or less with a factor of 10 if not more.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,450
So this is clearly an exponential decrease.

4
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,230
As we add a constant to n, the probability decreases by a certain factor

5
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,270
and that factor is one-tenth or ever worse.

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:33,370
So we definitely can see an exponential decrease of the success probability as a function of n.

7
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,870
Now, the exact analysis of this algorithm is not within the scope of this course,

8
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,210
although I would say it's understandable if have had a

9
00:00:40,210 --> 99:59:59,999
mid-level college course on probabilities and statistics.
