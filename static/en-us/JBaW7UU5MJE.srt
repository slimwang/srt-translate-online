1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,908
I'm going to trace name, friends and numFriends. I start at the first line,

2
00:00:04,908 --> 00:00:10,045
create a new person with the name Sara. So name will be set to the name I

3
00:00:10,045 --> 00:00:16,116
passed in. Friends is empty, numFriends is 0. And then we're done with the

4
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:22,130
constructor. We do the same thing for Chenghan. And now we add a friend to

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:27,813
Sara. So in addFriend, friends will get longer, it'll be friends plus Chenghan

6
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:32,948
and numFriends will go up by one. And then that method's done, so we go up to

7
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:39,158
the next line. In sara.unfriend, we shorten friends, we replace Chenghan in a

8
00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:46,340
space with nothing. So friends goes back to being nothing and then we're done.

9
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,500
Something went wrong here, though. I clearly have no friends in the list here.

10
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,932
But here, my number of friends is still 1. We saw when that happened. In

11
00:00:55,932 --> 00:01:02,032
unfriend, we updated the list of friends, but didn't update the number of

12
00:01:02,032 --> 00:01:04,303
friends.
