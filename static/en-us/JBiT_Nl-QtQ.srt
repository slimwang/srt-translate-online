00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,839
So now it's time for a quiz to

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,830
see if you understand how replacement grammars work and

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,950
can follow the BNF grammar we have here.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,670
So the question is, which of these sentences can

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:14,763
be produced from the grammar here, starting from the non-terminal sentence?

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,670
So check all of the sentence that are in the grammar. The choices are Python

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,240
eat cookies, Python eat Python, and I like eat.
