1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,150
So that's the end of this lesson.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,500
You will undoubtedly go back and

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,530
look at this pretty carefully since this algorithm and the manipulation of data

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,261
sets are going to serve as the basis of the first part of the Hough problem set.

5
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:14,075
And when you look up this stuff on the web,

6
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:18,340
which many of you will you'll want to relate that back to what we've seen here.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,490
And I'll tell you this,

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,890
implementing the Hough transform feels relatively straightforward.

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,660
That's why people, when it was on a course where the problem set was

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,350
due Sunday night at 11:55 p.m.,

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,159
many of them started at around 6:00 p.m.

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,040
They later reported that it

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,740
took them more like ten hours to do this problem set.

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,340
And that's because the extensions and so, etc.

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,250
Nothing quite works exactly like I say it does.

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,110
That by the way, is going to be a lesson of this class.

17
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,360
The papers, first, what we say in class never works.

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,030
because it's a distillation of the simple stuff.

19
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,180
What we say in papers hardly ever works,

20
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,220
because we have to make it very you know, sound great for publication.

21
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,683
In reality, stuff works, you take the theory and

22
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:02,450
then you have to massage both the imagery and the al and the algorithms.
