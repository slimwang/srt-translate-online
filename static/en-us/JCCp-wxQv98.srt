00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,800
Before we represent those sentences in the language of logic, let us consider

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,280
another example of conceptual knowledge and its relationship to logic first. So

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,410
here is a concept of four. We have come across this earlier.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,760
They were a block and a block and a brick at the bottom and a brick at the top.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,680
And some relationship between these objects. Given this conceptual knowledge

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,740
about foo we can ask ourselves, what are the sufficient conditions for

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,370
something to be a foo? Here are several choices. Please mark all of those

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,000
choices that together make for sufficient conditions for the concept of foo
