00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,699
The answer is Greenwich Mean Time.

2
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:07,330
You may have noticed that Greenwich
Mean Time has no offset from UTC.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,169
This is because
Greenwich Mean Time now is UTC.

4
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:16,539
The reference line, the prime meridian,
was determined to be in London.

5
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:19,710
So UTC was created as
a scientifically defined standard.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,202
[BLANK_AUDIO]

7
00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:25,833
By the way, that coordinate you just
looked up is actually the set of

8
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,120
Diagon Alley in the UK.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,440
It's awesome.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,920
You can check it out
on Google Street View.

11
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:35,979
Even if you aren't making
magical trips to Diagon Alley.

12
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:39,449
A global audience on your site can
benefit from the Time Zone API.

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,859
Converting times or
schedules to a user's specific location

14
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:44,519
can deliver a much
better local experience.

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,710
Speaking of which,

16
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,370
how can we use Google's APIs to
actually retrieve a location?

17
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:52,119
We'll look at the Geolocation API next.
