1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,439
One area of genetic research that psychologists are really interested in these

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,533
days is Epigenetics. Simply put, epigenetics is interested in the heritable

3
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:12,223
change caused by the environment. In other words, how the environment affects

4
00:00:12,223 --> 00:00:14,770
if our genes are turned on or off.

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,668
>> That's right, Lauren. Epigenetics is a really new and exciting field of

6
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:21,060
genetics that's teaching us a lot about how the environment influences gene

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,870
expression. Now it's really important to remember, that this is not mutation.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,080
The genetic sequence is unchanged. What's happening is the environment is

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,930
physically modifying the DNA, in a way that shuts a gene on or off.

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,020
>> So how does that work?

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,810
>> Well, you can think about it like chemicals that you take in from your local

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,130
environment.

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,470
>> So, by chemicals, do you mean things like diet, or even chemical exposure?

14
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,170
>> Sure, like that. Even things like exercise and metabolism can produce these

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,000
basic factors too. And these factors, or chemicals, physically modify the DNA

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,770
independent of the genetic sequence, and this will determine whether or not a

17
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,150
gene can be read.

18
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,340
>> So these modifications make genes a product of both nature.

19
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,480
>> Right, the genetic sequence itself.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,610
>> And nurture.

21
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,550
>> Right, the epigentic or environmental influence.
