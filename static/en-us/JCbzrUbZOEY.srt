OMT was developed at General Electric corporation by James Rumbaugh and

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:10,110
others that were there. It resulted in a book, a cover of a book as a,

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,435
a die on which there are three visible faces. And

4
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:18,970
one face has a class model diagram, one face has a state chart diagram, and

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,170
one face has a data flow diagram. The class model gave you

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,040
the structural aspects, the state chart gave you the behavioral aspects, and

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,050
the data flow diagram gave you the functional aspects.

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:34,250
That is OMT was a way of putting together three views of

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,205
a system into a cohesive view. As OMT was coming along other competitive,

10
00:00:40,205 --> 00:00:42,680
object-oriented methods and diagrams were also being developed.
