00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,766
There is a second time constant that often is used to describe decay processes:

2
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:11,299
The half-life, as opposed to the lifetime, which we've covered before.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,699
After the half-life, half of the particles have decayed, half of them are still there.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,266
Often, this is written as T subscript one half.

5
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:24,632
What's the relation between half-life and lifetime?

6
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:33,833
Is the lifetime smaller than the half-life? Is it equal to the half-life? Or is it larger than the half-life?
