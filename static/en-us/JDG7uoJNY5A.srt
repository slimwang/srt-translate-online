1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,610
We're very sensitive to this structure of parallel lines and

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,820
what they convey to us.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,960
Now, most of you have seen this Muller-Lyer illusion,

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,040
right, of which one of these lines is longer?

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,040
And you probably all know that well, actually, they're the same length, and

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,660
you probably saw that back in grade school and it's kind of cool.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,720
Let me show you another version of it that shows you why this

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,760
can be an interesting effect.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,280
Okay, so here we have a picture, okay?

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,350
And you can see the red arrow in here and the same red arrow in there.

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,200
And let me take that away.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,700
And now the question is, which of those is longer?

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,020
And that one's a lot harder to, for you to say that, you know what?

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,200
They're actually the same length.

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,946
So you go back there.

16
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:41,660
In fact, when you pull them away, when I stare at them,

17
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,170
they look like they're different length.

18
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,120
But of course they're actually length.

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,520
And that's because you're using this perspective projection as a way of

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,040
saying that in the real world, okay, the distance from

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,980
here to here is more than the distance from here to there actually.

22
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,540
All right?

23
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,190
That is, this is the height of the whole wall.

24
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,280
This is just the height of the ticket window.

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,670
So, it looks the same on your image, but

26
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,730
your brain automatically wants to undo that projection transformation.
