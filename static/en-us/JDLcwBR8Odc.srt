1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,569
You've got your answers. Let me tell you what

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:04,019
we think the answers are. Now the nice thing

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,320
about a decision tree sort of conceptually and intuitively,

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,670
is that it really is asking a series of

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:14,100
questions. So, we can simply look at these rows

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,200
over here and the values that our features have

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,500
and we can just follow down the path of

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,840
the tree. So, in the first case. We have true.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,970
We have true for occupied, which means we want to go

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,470
down the right side of the tree. And check on the

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,600
type. So in the first case, the type is pizza.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,329
And so we go down the first branch and that means.

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,280
We do not go down the tree. So, the output is no go.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,610
>> So, okay, so now, I got a different answer. So, I looked at this

15
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:58,020
and I said happiness is true. And, the bottom box says happiness true, you go.

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,482
>> Right. So, you got the wrong, you got what I'm

17
00:01:00,482 --> 00:01:03,150
going to tell you is the wrong answer by going from the

18
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,970
bottom of the tree up. The way decision trees work is

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,170
you always start at the root of the tree. That is

20
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,250
the very top of the tree. And you ask the questions in tho, in that order.

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,600
>> It just seems like it would be faster to start at the bottom.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,200
>> Yeah but then you would never look at anything else in the tree.

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,890
>> Good point. All right so.

24
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,090
>> If you start at the bottom, you can't go up. Alright. So, okay, so let

25
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,100
me see if I get this straight. So I'll, I'll do the, the second instance. The

26
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,180
second instance, you say that we need to start at the top of the tree where

27
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,220
it says occupied. And so now I look

28
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,600
at the instance and the instance says that it's

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,170
false for occupied, so we go down that left branch and we hit no

30
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:44,140
go. Oh wait but now I haven't look at any of the other nodes.

31
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,350
>> You don't have to look at any of the other

32
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,920
nodes because it turns out that if it's not occupied you

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,710
just don't go into a restaurant. So you're the type of

34
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,870
person who doesn't like to be the only person in a restaurant.

35
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:58,000
>> Got it, all right, so that's a no go. So

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,760
that's a no-go. That's an important point, Michael. Actually, you might also

37
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,690
notice that this whole tree, even if you look at every single feature in the

38
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:10,518
tree, only has three of the attributes. It only

39
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:15,860
looks at occupied. Type. And happiness.

40
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,930
>> I see. So hot date is sort of irrelevant which is good,

41
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,460
because in this case it's not really changing from instance to instance anyway.

42
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,930
>> True. And neither is hungry you might notice.

43
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,600
>> Oh, I am kind of hungry.

44
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,270
>> Although, I'm always hungry. Although raining does in fact change

45
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,550
a little bit here and there. But it apparently it doesn't matter.

46
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,320
>> I see.

47
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,890
>> Because you always take an umbrella.

48
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,820
>> Got it.

49
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,060
>> Okay, so let's quickly do the other three

50
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,090
and see if we we come to the same conclusion.

51
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,120
>> Alright. Well all the instances that have occupied

52
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,410
false we know those are no go, right away.

53
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,130
>> Oh, good point.

54
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,010
>> So we can do it kind of out of order. And

55
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,450
the other ones are both occupied. One is Thai and one is other.

56
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,310
For the Thai one we go.

57
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,870
The other one, oh I see, for the other

58
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,830
one we have to look at whether there's happiness

59
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,860
or not, and in this instance happiness is true.

60
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,220
So we get on the right branch and we go.

61
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,600
>> And we go. Exactly it. So we notice hot date doesn't matter,

62
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,640
hungry doesn't matter and rainy doesn't matter. And the only thing that matters

63
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,790
are whether you're occupied, what type

64
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,840
of restaurant you're at and whether you're

65
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,020
happy or not. Or whether the, the patrons in the restaurants are restaurant is,

66
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,340
are happy or not. But, here's the other thing

67
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,290
about this. It's not just about the features. Let's tie

68
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,160
it back in to the other things, that we

69
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,980
mentioned in the beginning. This, in our case, this table

70
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,730
actually represents our testing set. It's the thing that

71
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,420
we're going to look at to determine whether we were

72
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,370
right or wrong. These are the examples that we're going to

73
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,210
do to see whether we generalize or not. And this

74
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:52,798
particular tree here is our candidate concept. So there's lots

75
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:54,722
and lots and lots of other trees that we might

76
00:03:54,722 --> 00:03:57,820
have used. We might have used a tree that also

77
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,960
took, asked questions about whether it was rainy or not

78
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,190
or asked questions about whether you were on a hot

79
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,970
date or not. But we didn't. We picked a specific

80
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,390
tree that had only these three features and only asked

81
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,830
in this particular way. So what we're going to talk about next.

82
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,269
Is how we might decide whether to choose this tree over any

83
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,100
of the other possible number of trees that we might have chosen instead.
