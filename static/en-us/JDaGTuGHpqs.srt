1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now schedule is defined in terms of specifying for every task in the network

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the earliest start that, which we'll call "ES," and the latest possible start time,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which we call "LS" for which it's possible to complete the task network

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
in the shortest possible total amount of time.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We can define these with a set of recursive formulas

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
which can be solved by dynamic programming.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The earliest start time of the start state is defined as being zero.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The earliest start time of any state B is defined as being the maximum over all As

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
which have an arrow leading into B--

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that is all As that are defined to be predecessors of B--

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
of the earliest start time of A plus the duration of A.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
For example, the earliest start time of this state here would be the maximum

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
over all the ones that are coming in, which is only this one.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The maximum of its start time, which will be here, plus its duration, which would be 30.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Then the latest start time is defined by saying the latest start time of the finish,

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
is the same as the earliest start time of the finish,

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
because the finish by itself has no duration--

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
it's just there to give us a point to end at.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The latest start time in general of any node A

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
is the minimum over all B which come after A,

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
of the latest start time of B minus the duration of A.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
These formulas together define a unique schedule, which is the fastest possible schedule.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What I want you to do is fill in for me in the upper left hand the earliest start time,

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
in the upper right the latest start time for each of these nodes.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Here I've zoomed in a bit just to give you a little bit more room to fill in the blanks.
