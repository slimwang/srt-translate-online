00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,918
Let's see how we can access the individual array elements. With arrays, you

2
00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:08,840
don't call a method to get at an element. Remember with an array list we would

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,439
have called .get, but with an array you use the brackets and you put the index

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:21,266
inside. The values bracket zero, is the equivalent of calling values, dot get

5
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:27,300
zero. For an array you use the brackets. For an array list, you use a method.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,684
You use the same notation if you want to store something, into an array. So

7
00:00:31,684 --> 00:00:37,480
here values bracket zero equals 42 means put the number 42 into the zero slot

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,600
of this array. That's a little simpler than with array lists where we would

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,430
have had to call .set(0,42). How can we look at all of the elements of an

10
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:55,516
array? That's very similar as with array lists. Here we have a for loop. We

11
00:00:55,516 --> 00:00:58,590
want to look at values bracket i and i goes from zero to one less than the

12
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,808
length of the array. With an array list we would have called dot size. Note

13
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:13,616
that length does not have parentheses. That's just an oddity for historical

14
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:17,638
reasons. We simply looked at all of the elements in the array, and as with an

15
00:01:17,638 --> 00:01:23,320
array list, we can use an enhanced for loop to make this a little simpler.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,490
Here's the equivalent enhanced for loop, over here is our array. We want value

17
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:33,135
to assume each of the elements in turn, and then we use it. Note that with the

18
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,718
enhance for loop, you cant tell any difference between an array and an array

19
00:01:35,718 --> 00:01:40,388
list. You put the array, array list to the right of the colon, and the variable

20
00:01:40,388 --> 00:01:45,169
to the left of the colon gets assigned each element in term.
