1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,630
So we did it.

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:02,840
We came to the end.

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,110
>> Great job.

4
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,439
So now you know how to use cross validation to validate your machine

5
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:08,109
learning algorithm and

6
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,780
to also pick the parameter tune that's going to work the best for you.

7
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,820
>> So what is next?

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,580
>> Next thing is the project.

9
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,900
We're going to give it a little bit of practice.

10
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,400
Hands on the keyboard.

11
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,420
>> It's really exciting.

12
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,420
Have fun with the project now.
