00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:01,710
Great!

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,450
You've come a long way
towards finishing this app.

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,470
You've also implemented the
IntentService and its receiver class.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,400
Now let's put everything
together by implementing the rest

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,765
of the main activity.

6
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:16,635
You'll connect the Google API client and
you'll manage the two buttons.

7
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:20,915
Allowing it to start the activity
service, to start receiving updates, and

8
00:00:20,915 --> 00:00:23,425
to stop it also, if you so desire.

9
00:00:23,425 --> 00:00:23,925
Let's go.
