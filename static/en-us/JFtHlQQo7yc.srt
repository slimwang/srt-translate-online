00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,760
Awesome work parameterizing a build!

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,430
It's the command line that has the upper
hand, which I hope makes some sense.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,030
Command line arguments are the last
chance to change the behavior

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,550
of your build.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,060
So it's useful for command line
arguments to take precedence.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:13,840
Awesome work.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,830
Now we can customize the behavior of our
build without having to edit the build

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,550
script every time.
