00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,611
Let's move on to another type of depressant. That's opioids. Opioids are

2
00:00:04,611 --> 00:00:10,122
medically very useful, because, they're effective pain relievers. Opiates

3
00:00:10,122 --> 00:00:16,520
include morphine, heroin, as well as oxycodone, among other drugs. The main

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,285
ingredient of these painkillers comes from the opium poppy. Although, some of

5
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:26,285
the drugs use a synthetic version. Acute effects of opiates are pain relief,

6
00:00:26,285 --> 00:00:31,115
confusion, lower blood pressure, decreased respiration, euphoria or a dreamlike

7
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:37,237
state as well as decreased coordination. In addition, they can produce nausea

8
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:42,735
and vomiting as well as. Constipation just as have seen with other drugs.

9
00:00:42,735 --> 00:00:47,127
Opioids can be very helpful when properly used as medical treatment, for

10
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:53,307
example, receiving morphine after having a surgery. However, these are often

11
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:58,630
abused. As with other central nervous system depressant, we see people display

12
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,709
tolerance to the effects of these drugs. Meaning, the person will have to take

13
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:08,314
more of the drug to produce the original effect. Now let's go back to Susan to

14
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:12,043
talk a little bit about heroin, a commonly abused opioid.
