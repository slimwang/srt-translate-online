00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,068
ok so now I've taken a grayscale dimage
and using edge detection turned it into

2
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:09,689
an image full of dots but only the dots
that represent edges in the original

3
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:12,150
image now let's connect the dots

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,808
I could connect the dots to look for any
kind of shape in my image but in this

5
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:20,939
case I'm looking for lines defined lines
i need to first adopt a model of a line

6
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,899
and then fit that model to the
assortment of dots in my edge detected

7
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,059
image keeping in mind that my image is
just a function of x and y i can use the

8
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:35,520
old familiar equation of a line y equals
MX plus B in this case my model includes

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,149
two parameters m and B in image space a
line is plotted as X versus Y but in

10
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,159
parameter space which we will call space
i can represent that same line as

11
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,229
Emerson's be instead the hough transform
is just the conversion from image space

12
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:57,119
to have space so the characterization of
a line image space will be a single

13
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,030
point at the position mb in half space
