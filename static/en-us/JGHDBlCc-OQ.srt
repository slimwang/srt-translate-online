00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,798
Grant expects that each order he receives will require about 0.1 gallons of

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,767
solution, or 1/10 of a gallon of solution. Grant also wants to have 10 extra

3
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:14,782
gallons of solution on hand, just in case of emergency. What we're looking for

4
00:00:14,794 --> 00:00:19,772
now is an equation that describes this situation. For this equation, let's allow

5
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:24,227
n to equal the number of expected orders of solution, and let's also let g equal

6
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,570
the total number of gallons of solution that Grant should order. Which of the

7
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:32,925
five equations that I've written down here relates the number of expected orders

8
00:00:32,937 --> 00:00:36,065
n, to the number of gallons, g, that Grant should order?
