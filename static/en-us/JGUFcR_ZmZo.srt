00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,280
So let's discuss the answer to our laptop

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,939
falls down quiz. For the pavement, the failure is

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,820
whatever causes the pavement to no longer perform its

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,020
function properly. Here, you might be tempted to say

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,140
that it needs to be replaced is the failure.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,550
But actually that's the repair of the failure. This

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,560
is fixing the pavement, it's not something that causes

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,320
it to deviate from its function. Really, it breaking,

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,079
causing it to need to be replaced, so

10
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:33,110
breaking is the failure. What's the fault? It's the

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,670
event that resulted in the first error. In

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,230
this case, it's not that the laptop fell out

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,290
of the bag, it had nothing to do with the pavement. Is it that the laptop hits

14
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,280
the pavement. And now what was the first error?

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,630
Well, it was that the pavement developed a crack.

16
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,150
The structure, the internal behavior of the pavement

17
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,360
is no longer the same as the proper

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,138
pavement. But we really notice this in terms

19
00:00:59,138 --> 00:01:02,459
of deviating from its specified function when it

20
00:01:02,459 --> 00:01:08,020
broke. So we can still use a pavement with a crack. The crack expanded, so the

21
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,270
error became bigger, but really until it broke,

22
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,320
the pavement was functioning properly. So this is what

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,050
we get at the end.
