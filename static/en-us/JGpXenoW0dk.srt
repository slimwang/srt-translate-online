1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
a very first project in the self-driving

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,370
candle will be to find lane markings

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,290
why is that important but i can tell you

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,719
if you can't find the markings you will

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,969
have no clue where to drive you probably

6
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,980
don't pay much attention to him as a

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,809
self-advocate engineer they become your

8
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:16,650
best friend

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,109
they tell you a lot yesterday to drive

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,100
we're here at rolling me instead our

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,350
learning problem with copy and cologne

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,290
you would behave yourselves are steering

13
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,160
actions and brake gas actions and you

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,710
get a chance to try it on yard when we

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,690
train people who don't train them even

16
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,149
the rules between environmental examples

17
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,820
so this unit you want to apply for that

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,400
works deep learning to Cameron ridges

19
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,600
and do some the very things in the

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,390
surface are to the right

21
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,480
what is computer vision but you and i

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,000
drive a car we use our is more than any

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,100
other woman to understand what to do

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,590
division this is the same capability

25
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,289
into computers use cameras and we learn

26
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,449
how to extract things like markings and

27
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:02,399
other vehicles lot of cameras

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,939
it's a lot of fun and they're really

29
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,130
excited to get into the world of sensor

30
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,580
fusion or sensor fusion is the science

31
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,680
how to integrate different types of

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,960
sensors south africa's have things like

33
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,689
lighters and they have Raiders and also

34
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,640
cameras and the internal sensors

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,470
controller scopes and inertial

36
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,200
measurement units sensor fusion is the

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,759
science how to color with a single

38
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,140
Korean picture based on these different

39
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,400
modalities organization is the simple

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,670
question where relative to the world is

41
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,440
a

42
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,420
and it's important because as you're

43
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,400
going to see you in a bit maps on the

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,990
environment lots of detailed information

45
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,790
some of it might even be invisible to

46
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,650
the robot leg where the danger zones

47
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,410
where do pedestrians typically cross and

48
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,470
to make sense of those Maps one must

49
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,330
know where it is right for the neck and

50
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,300
the alignment of the sensor data current

51
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,790
position to a map that's what's called

52
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,120
an opposition so now we're entering the

53
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,740
fascinating world of what's called

54
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,100
control in technical terms of the

55
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,169
controller does it's a computer program

56
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,590
that steers your wheels you're gasping

57
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,290
your brake pedal so as to me given

58
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,640
objective so for example if your

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,290
objective is to stay centered in the

60
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,900
boat and you start driving and your cart

61
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,870
is little to the left your controller is

62
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,270
the unit decides okay we accomplish it

63
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,760
with a slight writer the seal that might

64
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,950
sound trivial but it's really easy to

65
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:37,580
screw it up half bending is the science

66
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,400
of how to find a valid sequence of steps

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,220
for instance in amazed when you weren't

68
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,690
stuck in manhattan for example even

69
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,720
across the city you have to find a plan

70
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,880
a sequence of streets you want to go

71
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,640
down to make it all the way in the end a

72
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,890
path planning algorithm isn't i wouldnt

73
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,930
that finds that sequence of actions for

74
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,120
you we can apply to city navigation can

75
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,340
also apply to part interrogation order

76
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,610
for example across the parking lot

77
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,140
so now we're ready for the most

78
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,450
fascinating part of this telling me you

79
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,640
would take your quote on to a physical

80
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,650
car and drive around in California

81
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,210
sounds scary

82
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,400
yes some slightly scared but also really

83
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,710
excited because there's no great number

84
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,570
that we would be complete actually

85
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,400
writing finding actual software actually

86
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,110
cars so let's do it
