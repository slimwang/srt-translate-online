1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:06,110
So two cases down, one third case to handle is if in fact

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,740
the first elements of x and y are not the same. To deal with this

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,079
case what we're going to do is we're going to carve up Y into three pieces, and

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,780
we're going to determine what those three pieces are based on where and

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:25,240
why the first element of X is. So, the first element of X is five.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,830
Someplace in Y there is a five otherwise it's not a permutation. So

7
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:36,000
let's call the position of five in y the jth position and

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,830
our three segments are going to be from one up to J minus one. Second segment is

9
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,990
going to be the jth position all by itself and the third segment is going to

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,470
be the j plus first position all the way to the nth position.

11
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,460
The last position. Three segments and we are going to define whether or

12
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,810
not x and y are permutations in terms of those three segments.
