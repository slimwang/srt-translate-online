1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,990
Alright, so we've got our two attendees. Johnny Concert and Misty Music.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:03,469
>> Yup.

3
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:05,720
>> And we've got our two festivals,

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,480
ROFLpalooza and Cloudstock. I really like those names.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:08,480
>>

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,549
[LAUGH].

7
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:10,142
Me too.

8
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:10,750
>>

9
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,000
>> But can you see the problem here?

10
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,970
>> I mean, they don't have anything to do, like this festival doesn't

11
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,290
know anything about the attendees, so there's no way to like match them.

12
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,140
>> Right. We don't know which festival either of those people are going to.

13
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,460
>> Yeah.

14
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,040
>> So we'll need to relate those two tables.

15
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,060
>> Okay. And so how do we, how do we do that? How do we think about that?

16
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,960
>> So let's take a look at it on the tablet to make it a little more clear.

17
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,330
>> Okay.

18
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,680
>> So, start off by

19
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,720
looking at our festival object. We have the festival here. The, all of

20
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,290
the different field names. And then we

21
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,670
have individual records, like Cloudstock and ROFLpalooza.

22
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,680
>> Right, right. And the fields were our columns. And, I get that.

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:45,840
>> Yep.

24
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,620
>> Okay.

25
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,230
>> So, we could also think about what our attendee object could look like.

26
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:49,480
>> Okay.

27
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,150
>> Here we have same sort of thing. All of our

28
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,400
fields as the columns and then our records as the rows.

29
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:54,870
>> Okay.

30
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,680
>> But if we were trying to relate these two tables, we would need to create

31
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,550
a relationship field on one of them.

32
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,550
>> Okay. So like, can I think of that as a new column?

33
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,510
>> Think of it as a new column in

34
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,360
the table, exactly. So, what would make more sense, to

35
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,130
add a column onto Attendees relating it to Festival, or

36
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,650
to add a column onto Festival relating it to Attendees?
