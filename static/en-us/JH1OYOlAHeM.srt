00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,220
Let's continue using our equation solving skills to tackle some other problems.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,650
This time we're going to try motion problems. The primary concept we're dealing

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,834
with, with motion problems is distance equals rate times time. For any object

4
00:00:14,834 --> 00:00:19,040
that moves at a constant rate. We can find the distance that it travels by

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,118
multiplying its rate by its time. The time is how long the object is traveling

6
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:28,650
at that given rate. So, let's say a car is traveling at 60 miles per hour and

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:34,720
it traveled for 2 hours. Well, that means in 1 hour it goes 60 miles, so in 2

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,981
hours it goes double that, which is 120 miles. This formula should make sense,

9
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:45,923
and the units down here should also make sense. We know if we multiply miles

10
00:00:45,923 --> 00:00:50,396
per hour times the number of hour, our hours will cancel leaving us with just

11
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:57,374
miles. So if we know that distance equals rate times time. What equations could

12
00:00:57,374 --> 00:01:02,098
we write for the rate and for the time? In other words, I want you to solve

13
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:06,986
this equation for r and write the expression here. And then solve this equation

14
00:01:06,986 --> 00:01:09,360
for t, and write that expression here.
