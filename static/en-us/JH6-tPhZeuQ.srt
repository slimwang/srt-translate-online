1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,184
So how do we do that?

2
00:00:01,184 --> 00:00:04,307
Well, there was originally something called the eight-point algorithm.

3
00:00:04,307 --> 00:00:08,412
It, it was done by, I think it was done by Christopher Hagens and for awhile,

4
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:11,889
it got sort of a bad rep, because people thought it was a very unstable and

5
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:15,672
that's why I put down that it was they infamous eight-point algorithm.

6
00:00:15,672 --> 00:00:16,878
Now you might say,

7
00:00:16,878 --> 00:00:21,489
well, why can I do with just eight equations, I've got nine unknowns.

8
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:27,967
Well, remember p, f, p prime equals zero, I can scale the f any way I want.

9
00:00:27,967 --> 00:00:32,970
Which means, for example, I could set that last value to a one.

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,682
Not a very good way of doing things, but it does mean that if you gave me

11
00:00:36,682 --> 00:00:40,842
just eight points, I'd have equations and because I set the last one to one,

12
00:00:40,842 --> 00:00:43,860
I would have eight unknowns and I'd be able to solve it.

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,482
If I have more than eight equations, right?

14
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:51,108
So then I've got this, you know, suppose I've got n, so

15
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:54,970
I've got n equations with nine values that are homogeneous.

16
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,328
Have we seen that before?

17
00:00:56,328 --> 00:00:56,908
Yes.

18
00:00:56,908 --> 00:01:00,492
Remember when we solved very early on, when we were trying to solve for

19
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:02,151
the total calibration matrix?

20
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:04,787
Between the world and the image and we had the M matrix.

21
00:01:04,787 --> 00:01:08,444
So we said, well, there's 12 elements in here, but there's not really 12.

22
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:12,591
Right? There was really only 11, but if we used a whole bunch of points

23
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:17,325
we talked about, you could set 1 element M 1, but that wasn't such a good way.

24
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:21,161
What was a good way the SVD, remember you, you take,

25
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:26,288
you've got this A times M equals 0 or in this case, A times f equals 0.

26
00:01:26,288 --> 00:01:30,826
You've take a A transpose A.

27
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:34,843
Take the singular value decomposition or you just find the eigenvectors and

28
00:01:34,843 --> 00:01:37,989
you pulled out the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue.

29
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:40,544
We've actually seen this now three times.

30
00:01:40,544 --> 00:01:43,190
I did it explicitly for you in the very first example, so

31
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,924
you can go take a look at that.

32
00:01:44,924 --> 00:01:46,906
But that's how you solve it.

33
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:50,920
And by the way, you would typically use more points than just eight or nine or

34
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,943
you use however many points you have.

35
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:56,924
So you solve this and what happens?

36
00:01:56,924 --> 00:01:59,944
Well, your point matches aren't exact, are they?

37
00:01:59,944 --> 00:02:01,650
No, so you solve this.

38
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,229
Get an F.

39
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:05,388
With an F, I can draw some epipolar lines.

40
00:02:05,388 --> 00:02:06,004
Right?

41
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:09,987
And if I use an, and these numbers were meant to represent coming from that

42
00:02:09,987 --> 00:02:11,542
picture, I would see this.

43
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:12,307
Okay?

44
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:15,303
And that's technically called a mess, all right?

45
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:18,243
Because you'll notice that the epipolar lines,

46
00:02:18,243 --> 00:02:22,025
they're not all intersecting at that single point, are they?

47
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:23,046
No.

48
00:02:23,046 --> 00:02:24,787
Why not?

49
00:02:24,787 --> 00:02:26,400
Well, I'll tell you.
