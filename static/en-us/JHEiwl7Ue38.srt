1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:05,210
Another study Bandura did focused on reinforcing the observed behavior. Bandura

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,570
put children in to four groups. Group one saw a video with no models. Group two

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:16,102
saw two adult males interacting in a nonaggressive way. Group three and group

4
00:00:16,102 --> 00:00:21,390
four saw two adult males playing with one of the males being aggressive.

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,451
However in group three, the aggressive one was punished. And in group four, the

6
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:30,996
aggressive one was rewarded. The first two groups are what we would consider

7
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:35,550
the control groups. In group three and group four were the experimental groups.

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,618
The results show that the kids in the two experimental groups were more

9
00:00:38,618 --> 00:00:43,550
aggressive than the kids in the control groups. However, the kids who saw the

10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:49,090
adult being rewarded were even more aggressive than anyone else. This proves

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,055
that we not only learn from other people's behavior, we also take into account

12
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:58,450
the consequences of other people's behavior. And those consequences would be

13
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,749
either punishment or the reward.
