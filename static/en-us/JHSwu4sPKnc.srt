1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,110
So if we look at this, it's actually the case that n vans splitting up the work.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:11,590
We'll take quite a bit less time from when they need to deliver the mail to when they get back to base.

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:16,990
Now, there might be some cases where it doesn't actually help out too much.

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,190
For example, if you have a graph where it's just a straight line

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,220
well then all the n vans are going to go here and here and here and here,

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,920
and then dot, dot, dot, dot,--well, you haven't really save any time.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,900
However, if you have instead a graph like this, well then, you can have four vans

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,470
each go out on one of the arms and come back to base instead of having a single van

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,160
that would have to go here and come back and here and back,

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,370
and here and back, and here and back.

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,420
That's quite a bit more time.

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,930
You don't want to have to do that and that's why you used more vans and it turns out

13
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:58,190
that the time delivered the mail and return is always going to be less than or equal to

14
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,460
depending on the actual case.

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,260
Now, how bout the sum of time taken by the vans.

16
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,830
This is going to be at least as much as and maybe more.

17
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,740
To see this, let's actually take a look at those same two problems.

18
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,490
In this case, it takes an hour to leave base and go along the road

19
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,050
to where you're delivering the mail and then an hour to come back.

20
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,190
This is a very long delivery route.

21
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:33,240
Then if you have four vans then the time taken is two hours for each van

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,580
which would be eight hours which in this case is actually the same.

23
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,640
Now, the other case where you have to go along here.

24
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,860
Now let's say if you have four vans then, well, neither van come up here and then go back.

25
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,650
Neither van to come up here and go back and then come up here and go back

26
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:59,090
and then come up here and go back, that's actually the quickest you can do it

27
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,550
while still utilizing all four vans.

28
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:07,870
In that case, you're taking two hours there, four hours there, six hours there, and eight hours there.

29
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:17,470
Instead if one man, he will just take one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight total.

30
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,490
So the actual total time taken is quite a bit larger in this case.

31
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,100
So, it really depends on what you all want to optimize.

32
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,710
Generally, the time that it takes to deliver all the mail is probably more important

33
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,980
to most people than the sum of the individual driver's time

34
00:02:34,980 --> 99:59:59,999
and it's really a trade off which is one is better here.
