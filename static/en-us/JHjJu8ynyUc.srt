00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,380
These next few videos will explain the final project. And give

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,430
you guidance before you get started working on it. Now, if you're

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,780
enrolled in the full course experience you should complete the project. And

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,720
learn how your project's going to be evaluated. If you're enrolled in

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,780
the free courseware, you can still complete the EDA project to

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,530
showcase your skills. But you won't be submitting the project to Udacity.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,190
Now, you might be wondering what should go into your analysis and

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,450
how it should be formatted. We provided an example that is linked

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,310
in the instructor notes. The example is an analysis

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,000
of the diamond status set. And you should pay careful

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,340
attention to how observations and questions are interspersed through

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,170
out it. It's almost like a stream of consciousness of

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,240
an analysts thoughts. And you should do the same

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,720
exact thing when conducting your own analysis. Now, if you

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,040
haven't already, go to the Instructor Notes. Download the example

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,700
and the instructions to complete your analysis and get started.
