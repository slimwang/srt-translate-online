00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,322
So let's take a look at the solution for this quiz. As defined before, we can

2
00:00:03,322 --> 00:00:07,042
go ahead and add the event listener objects to the canvas element for our

3
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:12,672
document specifying the mouse move and key down events. To be given these

4
00:00:12,672 --> 00:00:15,785
functions. Looking at the filled in code, you can see that things are actually

5
00:00:15,785 --> 00:00:20,144
pretty simplistic. The event itself actually specifies client.x and client.y as

6
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:25,033
member variables that we can then query and print out to the console log. The

7
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:28,450
onKeyDown event, in contrast, is given a similar event objects, but rather than

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:33,270
having the client.x and client.y variables it actually has the keyID variable.

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,580
Which specifies the ASCII value of the key that was pressed on the keyboard.
