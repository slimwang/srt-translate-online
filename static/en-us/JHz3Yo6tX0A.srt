00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,850
We've been talking about the importance
of protecting sensitive data.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,590
Actually, a lot of our sensitive
data is stored in databases.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,530
When you hear about a major data breach,

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,750
chances are that a database
was compromised.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,640
So, in this lesson,

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,140
we're going to explore issues
that are unique to databases.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,500
How do we do access control for
data that is stored in a database?

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,230
Are there new kind of attacks that
are possible, and if yes, are there new

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,440
defenses that we need to use to protect
the data that is stored in databases?
