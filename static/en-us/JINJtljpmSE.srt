00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,150
To change the color of, Hello, World!,
I need to write another CSS Rule Set.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,370
In my file,
I will add a new line and type h1,

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,630
followed by some braces,
then the color green.

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,215
This will tell my browser to select
all of the h1 tags in my document and

5
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:22,035
change the color of their text to green.

6
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:25,635
If I save and refresh,
boom, there you go.

7
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:26,695
Hello, World!, is now green.
