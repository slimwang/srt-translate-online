1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is a non-trivial question,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and the right way to do this is to go through the truth table,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which I've drawn over here.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There's 3 different things happening.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We've taken initial pick of the coin,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which can take coin 1 or coin 2 with equal probability,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and then you go flip it for the first time,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and there's heads or tails outcomes,

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and we flip it for the second time with the second outcome.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So these different cases summarize my truth table.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I now need to observe just the cases where

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
head is followed by tail.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This one right here and over here.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Then we compute the probability for those 2 cases.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The probability of picking coin 1 is 0.5.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
For the fair coin, we get 0.5 for heads,

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
followed by 0.5 for tails.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
They're together is 0.125.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's do it with the second case.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
There's a 0.5 chance of taking coin 2.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now that one comes up with heads at 0.9.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It comes up with tails at 0.1.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So multiply these together, gives us 0.045,

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
a smaller number than up here.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Adding these 2 things together results in 0.17,

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
which is the right answer

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
to the question over here.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That was really non-trivial,

29
00:01:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'd be amazed if you got this correct.
