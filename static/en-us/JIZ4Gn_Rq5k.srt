00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
If you haven't had a theory of computation class,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not going to explain this now, but I hope some of you have had it

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and will be able to answer the next quiz,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which is if it's proven that factoring is NP-hard,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
what would it mean?
