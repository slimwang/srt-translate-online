00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,730
Recall the five rules of message passing
and consider the following scenario.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,450
Suppose I have a linear
network of eight nodes.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,660
So suppose that node zero wants
to send a message to node two,

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,640
at exactly the same time that node six
wants to send a message to node three.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,582
How much time will it take for these
two simultaneous messages to transpire?

6
00:00:21,582 --> 00:00:24,639
Here's the path from
node zero to node two and

7
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:28,470
here's the path from
node six to node three.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,040
Notice that these messages occupy
independent paths in the network,

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,600
therefore, they can
happen simultaneously.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,510
So if the messages are both of size n
then the time is just alpha plus beta

11
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,830
times n.

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,720
Now I want you to try.
