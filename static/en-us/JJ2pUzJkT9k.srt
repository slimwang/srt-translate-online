00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,370
Software architecture prescribes the high level structure of a system in

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,240
terms of it's components and how they interact.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,220
A key determinate of course of the architectural is

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,040
the functionality the system must provide.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,640
Also important is that the system must satisfy a set of possibly confic,

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,710
conflicting nonfunctional requirements.

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,720
This lesson will provide guidance on the latter aspect.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,060
The material in the lesson is drawn from the book by Bosch listed on

00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,390
