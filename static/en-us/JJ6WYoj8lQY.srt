00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,512
Does the point 3, 7 lie on the line y equals 3x minus 5? I'm going to walk you

2
00:00:04,524 --> 00:00:09,246
through some of the steps to do this, or at least give you some hints about how

3
00:00:09,258 --> 00:00:14,091
we should go about it. I'd like you to start by substituting in the proper value

4
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:18,391
from the point into the left-hand side of the equation. L H S here is just

5
00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:22,496
shorthand for left-hand side. So type in the value here of the number that this

6
00:00:22,508 --> 00:00:26,658
side should simplify to. Then do the same thing for the right-hand side. That's

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,731
what R H S stands for. Plug in the proper coordinate to the proper variable, and

8
00:00:30,743 --> 00:00:34,925
simplify this side of the equation. Once you've found the numbers that belong in

9
00:00:34,937 --> 00:00:39,090
these boxes. Tell me if they're equal to one another, and then, depending on how

10
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:43,056
you answer that question, what does this say about whether or not this point

11
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:43,954
lies on this line?
