00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,480
We now know how the processor is predicting which instruction to fetch next. You

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,970
will put this knowledge to work in a project in this class. But some

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,410
branches are very difficult to predict. So

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,350
next lesson is about helping the compiler

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,560
completely eliminate these branches from the program

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,120
so we do not have to predict them.
