1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:06,010
In fact, using electronic medical
records is part of the definition

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,580
of one of the most common forms
of patient centered care,

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,120
the patient centered medical home.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,050
Elsewhere, a key culprit in creating
these coordination problems

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,210
has been paper records.

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:24,640
They can physically be in only one
place and are not easily shared.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,030
Even if shared,

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,930
they may not be easily understood due
to legibility issues or differences

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,740
among physicians in the terms they
use to describe the same thing.

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,630
Most of Marla's specialists
use paper records.

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,390
Until recently here in the US
most physicians used them.

12
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,290
This is rapidly changing because
of the new federal policies

13
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,780
we'll explain in lesson two.

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,270
Electronic records and
data sharing can help coordinate care.

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,430
Here's data from a recent survey
of physicians who are using

16
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,750
these technologies, and
they substantially agree that it helps.

17
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,320
Improved communication,
more available data.

18
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:14,300
Interestingly and importantly, both
PCPs and specialists with electronic

19
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,680
records say care is more coordinated and
communications are improved.

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,990
Presumably because data is now
immediately available when and

21
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,690
where it is needed, as a majority
of these physicians reported.
