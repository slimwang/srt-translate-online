1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In the case of this abstract action,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
we know all the possible outcomes are somewhere within here

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and none of those intersect with a goal,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
so there's nothing we can do to make this one work.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
For this abstract action, we see that there is an intersection,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and there's an intersection even in the under estimate of the state.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We know that we can reach someplace in here,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and since we have the choice of where we want to go,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
we know we can reach there,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
so we know that we can always refine this abstract action to achieve the goal.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Over here there's an intersection,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
but it's only in the over estimate--the outside part of the search space.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So we're not quite sure.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We have to look more carefully at the refinements to see if there is

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
a combination of refinements that allow us to reach this state,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
or if the combination of refinements leave us somewhere over here,

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
which is not inside that state.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So that would be questionable or unknown yet.
