00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,660
Here we're going to talk about one
of my favorite topics in this class,

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,630
Intelligent Tutoring Systems.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,530
The idea of Intelligent Tutoring Systems
is that we know students learn best when

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,320
they have individualized,
just in time feedback,

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,130
right there in the context
of the learning process.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,150
They learn best when they have
someone sitting with them saying, hey,

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,600
you just made a mistake
on that kind of problem.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,530
Here's how to avoid that mistake for
next time.

9
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,000
Or, great job on that problem.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,900
You didn't make the mistake
now that you made previously.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,900
The idea here is that,

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,210
it's not that we don't want to give all
the students this kind of feedback.

13
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,010
We definitely do, but we really
have difficulty doing so at scale.

14
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,010
We can't give every single student
a one on one tutor to have during their

15
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,780
entire educational career.

16
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,688
But with software we might
be able to come close.

17
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:39,550
Intelligent tutoring systems is
about creating software agents,

18
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,660
that can provide that same kind of just
in time individualized feedback to

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,180
students while they're learning.

20
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,680
And because they're software agents,
they're available all the time,

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,040
they don't have an hourly
cost associated with them.

22
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,160
They get past a lot of
the obstacles to having one-on-one

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,880
tutoring during your
entire educational career.

24
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,110
So in this lesson we'll talk about
intelligent tutoring systems and

25
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,150
some of the places they've
been most effective.

26
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,225
We'll especially talk about how they
exist in two different general areas.

27
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:05,280
Well-formed problem domains that
have a well-structured problem and

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,510
a correct answer.

29
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,460
And more poorly from problem
domains where the things to

30
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,550
learn are a little bit more fuzzy, and
a little bit more difficult to observe.
