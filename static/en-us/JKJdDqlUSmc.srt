00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,632
If we take out the factor of a from these two terms, the coefficient of the

2
00:00:04,632 --> 00:00:09,810
first term becomes one, and the coefficient of the second term becomes b over a.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,838
So we have a times the quantity x squared plus b over a x, and then, of course,

4
00:00:14,838 --> 00:00:16,417
plus c equals 0. Great.
