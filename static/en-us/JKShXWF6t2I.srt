00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,219
The techniques that could help us find
a global maximum, are random restart,

2
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:06,939
genetic algorithms, and
simulated annealing.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:11,469
MINIMAX algorithms are for game playing,
and are not really relevant here.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,095
Normal search algorithms,
like Breadth first First search and

5
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:19,075
uniform cost search are difficult to
use, even with two dimensional graphs,

6
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:21,254
as there are an infinite number
of directions we could step.

7
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:24,594
And our step might need to
be infinitesimally small,

8
00:00:24,594 --> 00:00:26,314
to insure we don't
skip over our solution.
