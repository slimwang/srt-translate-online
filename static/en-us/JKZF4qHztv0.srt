00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,780
Now ultimately we want to know if hearing this song, on hypothesis testing in

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,655
lesson nine, will result in higher engagement and learning. So what statistic

3
00:00:09,655 --> 00:00:14,494
should we calculate to determine this? Should we simply note whether or not the

4
00:00:14,494 --> 00:00:18,730
sample means are less than or greater than the population mean? Or should we

5
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:23,694
calculate the actual difference between the population mean and the sample mean

6
00:00:23,694 --> 00:00:28,220
for each measure, or should we found out where each sample mean falls on the

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,965
distribution of sample means from each population, or should we find how many

8
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:37,843
population standard deviations each sample mean is from the population mean?
