00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,961
>> Let's get back to renting cars. This time you want to rent a car, and you're

2
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:08,429
comparing the cost between two companies, Car-nival and Rent-a-Car. Car-nival's

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,478
the same as before. They're going to charge $10 for a registration fee and $10

4
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:16,606
per hour for renting the car. Rent-a-car is a little bit different. They're

5
00:00:16,606 --> 00:00:20,742
going to charge $30 for a registration fee and $6 per hour for renting the car.

6
00:00:20,742 --> 00:00:25,126
So, which company's the better deal? Is it Car-nival, Rent-a-Car, does it

7
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:29,428
depend, do they cost the same, or would you rather teleport? This is one of

8
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:33,870
those questions you really want to take your time on. Try to create a table of

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,449
values for Car-nival and Rent-a-Car. You can let x be the number of hours and y

10
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:43,102
be the cost of the rental car. You can use the table to investigate this or even

11
00:00:43,102 --> 00:00:44,925
create a graph. Try your best.
