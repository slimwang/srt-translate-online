00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For your homework, I want these ranges of variables, as seen.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
But if you want true challenges, here are some more.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
For instance, you can go and also record the types of variables,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
say, the type of x is the same as the type of 2.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Or you could go and check for set patterns.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
For instance, you could report that the variable x

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
is in the list of values 2, 4, and 16.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The relationships between variables--

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In the square root function, the y variable always has the same value as the return value.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's not very surprising, because we actually return y, but that's an interesting property.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Likewise, the return value of a square root function

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
is always less or equal to the value that we want to compute the square root for.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You can obtain such relationships between variables

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
by coming up with a pattern, say like equal or less than,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and instantiating that pattern with all variables,

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and then seeing which patterns actually hold over multiple runs.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
With that, enjoy building your own dynamic invariant checker,

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and make it easier for future generations to write assertions. Thank you.
