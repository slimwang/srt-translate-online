00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,965
What do you think we would need to add to each of these polynomials to make a

2
00:00:02,965 --> 00:00:06,725
perfect square? You want to think about drawing out a diagram like we did

3
00:00:06,725 --> 00:00:09,785
before, and then seeing how many one pieces you will need to complete the

4
00:00:09,785 --> 00:00:15,398
square. And don't be fooled by these negative signs here. Even if the x term is

5
00:00:15,398 --> 00:00:19,761
negative, we'll still add a positive amount to complete the square. So, what do

6
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:24,160
you think for each of these? Take some time to think about it, and good luck.
