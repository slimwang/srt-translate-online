00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,840
Let's begin the process of building our
MDP to represent this state diagram.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,410
Our first step will be to define
the set of states for our MDP.

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,290
Let's take a look at a short program
I've written to accomplish this task.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,210
Notice that I am importing several
packages at the beginning of

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,580
the program.

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,540
If you'd like to run this code locally,
you'll need to make sure

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,120
you've included the burlap jar
file in your Java build path.

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,400
The jar file is available at the URL
listed in the instructor notes.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,190
The class I built, FirstMDP,
currently has two fields,

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,590
a Domain, and a DomainGenerator.

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:41,880
in my constructor for FirstMDP I'm
instantiating a new GraphDefinedDomain

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,520
object, and assigning it to the
FirstMDP's domain generator field, dg.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,160
I then use a method from
the GraphDefinedDomain object

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,910
to generate an appropriate
domain object,

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,460
which is then assigned to
the FirstMDP's domain field.

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,680
I've left two blanks in this code
which I'd like you to now fill in.

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,040
Using the documentation for the
GraphDefinedDomain class, please fill in

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,680
the appropriate argument or
arguments for the constructor I called.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,220
And also fill in the appropriate method
that needs to be called in order to

20
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,170
create a domain object using
the GraphDefinedDomain.

21
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,780
Again, a link to the documentation
can be found in the instructor notes.
