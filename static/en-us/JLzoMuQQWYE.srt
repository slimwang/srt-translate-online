1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We will now give a slightly more complicated problem of the form we're going to be using

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
we're going to be using and I hope you won't be too confused.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So, this is it. There's two parts to it.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There's the print command as before but rather than printing 0.3 directly,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
we're going to print the function that computes something from 0.3.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Right now it's identity is going to print out exactly the same value

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but we're doing this is to set ourselves up to print something else.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,680
And here is how f is defined.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:39,000
We define f with the argument p that will be set to 0.3,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
to be just a function that returns exactly the same value.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,730
Why do we do this? Well, to practice programming.

12
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,557
So, hit the run button and see what happens.
