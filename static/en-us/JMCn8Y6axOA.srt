00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,567
Now that we finally have values for w and
n to equal, we can plug them into our

2
00:00:04,579 --> 00:00:09,471
equation for total future earnings, using
substitution, like we have so many times

3
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:14,783
before. Can you use these two numbers, 30
and 12, in the proper places in this

4
00:00:14,783 --> 00:00:20,127
equation to come up with a number for the
total amount of money that Grant will make

5
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:23,205
off of the orders that have come in so
far? Think about what numbers you want to

6
00:00:23,217 --> 00:00:26,763
substitute where, and then be sure to be
careful about order of operations.
