00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,770
We know that there are two numbers when multiplied by themselves that equal 81.

2
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:09,733
We know that 9 times 9 equals 81 and we also know that negative 9 times negative

3
00:00:09,745 --> 00:00:14,256
9 equals 81. The way we would denote these with radical signs is different,

4
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:19,315
though. We get 9, positive 9, if we just write the square root of 81 and we get

5
00:00:19,327 --> 00:00:23,875
negative 9 if we write negative square root 81. The principal square root is a

6
00:00:23,887 --> 00:00:28,435
square root that doesn't have a negative sign out in front of it, the positive

7
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:32,915
square root, so the answer is 9. The principle square root of any number is a

8
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:36,220
positive number, that times itself, equals that number.
