1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:09,499
For two to the power of X, the slope is below one. You can see that by connecting this point and that point.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:17,832
The curve passes through X equals zero, Y equals one, and X equals one, Y equals two,

3
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:26,032
and the same is true for this line with a slope of one. Obviously, our power function, two to the power of X,

4
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:35,132
makes a left turn. If it hits this straight line in these red spots, it has to dive below that red line.

5
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:41,566
Meaning that its slope at x equals zero is less than the slope of the red line.

6
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:49,132
Less than one. The slope of three to the power of X at X equals zero is larger than one.

7
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:55,466
Let me add this straight line again that has a slope of one and a Y intercept of one.

8
00:00:55,467 --> 00:01:02,066
And if you look really closely, you'll see that this exponential function, three to the power of X and this red line

9
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:11,666
intersect at two points. The first intersection being close to X equals -.17. This means that the blue curve dives

10
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:19,533
below the red line on the left-hand side, meaning that it has to have a slope that is larger than one.
