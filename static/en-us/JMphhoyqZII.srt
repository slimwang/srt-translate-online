00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,880
Now you may have heard
about the debate of

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,890
passive investing versus
active investing.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,921
This question about passive versus
active didn't really exist before

4
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:13,398
the capital assets
pricing model came out.

5
00:00:13,398 --> 00:00:15,170
And I'll explain why in just a moment.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,410
But let me just briefly tell you
about passive versus active.

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:26,280
So passive essentially says that you
should just buy an index portfolio.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,830
Like buy something that
represents the S&P 500, and hold.

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,470
Just sit on it and let it grow.

10
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:38,800
Active portfolio managers don't
just buy the index portfolio,

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,370
they pick individual stocks.

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,700
Another way you can think of this is
if you compare the active managers

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,710
portfolio to the index.

14
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,400
You'll find that he or
she has higher weights for

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,400
some stocks and
lowers weights for other stocks.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,870
Of course those weights could be zero,
or even negative.

17
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,480
But the general idea here is that
the active portfolio manager's portfolio

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,140
differs from the market portfolio

19
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,530
by selecting different
weights on different stocks.

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,280
Let's return now to the capital
asset pricing model here, and

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,200
consider passive versus
active in that context.

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,740
Both active managers and

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,890
passive managers agree with
this part of the equation.

24
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,770
In other words,

25
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:30,250
however the stock moves each day is most
significantly influenced by the market,

26
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,720
and that the amount that it moves
is strongly related to beta.

27
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,230
Where they differ is with regard
to their treatment of alpha.

28
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,850
The CAPM says two important
things about alpha.

29
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,440
First, it's random.

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,155
You can't predict it, and
the expected value is zero.

31
00:01:50,155 --> 00:01:53,466
Some days it'll be positive,
some days it'll be negative.

32
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:57,380
It may be large, it may be small,
but it's random.

33
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,620
And on average,
it's value is going to be zero.

34
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,920
Active managers, on the other hand,
believe they can predict alpha.

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,470
In other words,
they can compare two stocks and

36
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,380
they say I think this one is going to
go up relative to the market.

37
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,520
Remember, this alpha is market-relative.

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,110
Or, I think this other stock is going to
go down relative to the market.

39
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,650
Now, they might not be exactly
right on every single pick.

40
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,360
But they believe on average they're
better than just flipping a coin.

41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,070
So if you believe what active managers
say, you can use information and perhaps

42
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:39,430
machine learning to find stocks that
have either positive or negative alpha.

43
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,050
And you can use that information
to select your stock picks.

44
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,520
And we'll show some
examples of that later on.

45
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,760
Anyways, if you believe the capital
assets pricing model, in other words

46
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,280
this alpha is fully random,
then you should be a passive investor.

47
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,730
Just buy an index and hold it.

48
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,440
If you believe active managers,
that they can find alpha,

49
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,930
then you should consider
being an active investor.
