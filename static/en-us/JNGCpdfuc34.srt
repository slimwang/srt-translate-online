00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,656
As we saw in the quiz before this one,
when we multiplied y^4 times y^-2, we used our

2
00:00:05,668 --> 00:00:11,410
short cut to say that this is just equal
to, of course, leaving the x^2 there,

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,660
y^4-2 power. The role that this -2
exponent here plays then, is that it makes

4
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:22,792
it so that, in the final answer, which we
know is x^2y^2, we have two fewer y's

5
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:29,016
multiplied together than we did in at
least this first part, the y^4 factor of

6
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:35,397
the original expression. But how do you
write y^-2 in terms of multiplying some

7
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:40,341
number of y's together. Well if we know
that y^4xy^-2=y^2.

8
00:00:40,342 --> 00:00:46,410
And also, we remember that y^4 is four ys
multiplied together. And similarly, y^2 is

9
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:51,812
two ys multiplied together. This y^ -2
needs to cancel out two of these other

10
00:00:51,824 --> 00:00:57,397
four ys that are multiplied together, to
give us our final answer. Now, we know

11
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:03,061
that the way that we undo multiplication
is division. y^4 needs to be divided by

12
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:08,003
y^2, to equal y squared, we can write this
out like this. We have four y's multiplied

13
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:12,057
together, divided by 2 y's multiplied
together, and each of these y's in the

14
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:16,376
denominator cancels out one of the y's in
the numerator, since everything here is

15
00:01:16,388 --> 00:01:20,405
just multiplied together. This is how we
end up with just two y's multiplied

16
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:25,543
together. Together, since we can see that
we only have y times y left on the left side. If

17
00:01:25,555 --> 00:01:30,323
we just look at this way of writing our
expression though, we can write both the

18
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:35,329
numerator and the denominator in terms of
exponents. So, on the top, we still have

19
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:39,422
y^4 and the bottom of our fraction we have
y times y, which is just y^2.

20
00:01:39,422 --> 00:01:45,696
So, if we move this way where an
expression appear to be end up with

21
00:01:45,696 --> 00:01:51,553
y^4 times y^-2=y^4/y^2.
We see this factor may be not we so need

22
00:01:51,565 --> 00:01:56,845
to multiply this pair x ^ 2 to get a final
answer. In this answer choice right here,

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
y^4x^2/y^2.
