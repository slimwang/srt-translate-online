1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,320
Here in the US, the PCP as
gatekeeper is almost always used by

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,420
Health Maintenance Organizations or
HMOs.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,350
There is data to show that this provides
better care quality at a lower cost.

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,970
Because of their key role in
coordinating care, HMO physicians almost

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,840
always have electronic patient
records and have for some time now.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,880
However, HMO's also almost always
provide a more limited choice of

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:36,420
physicians as a means of cost control
and to facilitate managing care quality.

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,460
Marla, like many Americans,
gets Health Insurance from her employer.

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,290
At work,

10
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:47,370
she didn't select an HMO mostly because
she wanted a wider physician selection.

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,050
And she didn't like the idea
of someone deciding for

12
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,520
her if she needed specialty care.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,160
She preferred to do that herself.

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,050
As a result, she doesn't have a PCP, and

15
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,390
gets all of her care
from many specialists.

16
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,540
Each of whom focuses on the problem
she has that is in their domain.
