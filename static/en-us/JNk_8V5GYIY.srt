Here we have the red ball in the ball class. One has to do two things. First of

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,536
all, the ball must implement the drawable interface. And we need to supply a

3
00:00:10,536 --> 00:00:14,856
draw method, in this case the method was very simple. It simply fills the

4
00:00:14,856 --> 00:00:21,080
circular shape. In the Scene class, we add a Ball, and that's it, nothing else

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,716
needs to be changed. The mechanism that does the drawing stays completely the

6
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:32,412
same. That's polymorphism in action. we have a general mechanism that can deal

7
00:00:32,412 --> 00:00:36,447
with any drawables. And if we want to add more, then we can simply add them

8
00:00:36,447 --> 00:00:39,690
without having to make any further changes.
