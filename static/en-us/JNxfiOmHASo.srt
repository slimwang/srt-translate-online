00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,029
There are a bunch of applications for
drawing in geometry.

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:04,849
One of which is land surveying.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,695
Imagine you're starting
a lawn mowing business and

4
00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:12,390
want to charge your clients based on
the square footage of their back yards.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,820
Simply map your properties, zoom in,
and draw a polygon to get the area.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,500
Using the app we built so far,
complete the following exercise.

7
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:27,489
Using an event listener on a polygon
completion event, add a feature that

8
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:32,189
calculates the area within the polygon
and alerts the number to the user.

9
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,950
Check out the geometry
library documentation

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,395
at the page listed below for more info.

11
00:00:38,395 --> 00:00:41,470
Were you able to calculate the area and
display it to the user?
