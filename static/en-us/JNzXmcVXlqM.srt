00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,850
Another problem with ECB is
that the plain text blocks

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,210
are encrypted into ciphertext
blocks independently of each other.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,310
Therefore an attacker can use
a previously captured ciphertext block

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,290
to sub out a current ciphertext block.

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,720
Or we arrange the order
of the ciphertext blocks.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,070
The result is violation
of message integrity.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,590
For example the attacker can
fabricate specific information.
