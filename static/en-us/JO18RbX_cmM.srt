1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,970
So, what we're going to do is we're going to calculate N.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,415
And it's actually really easy.

3
00:00:03,415 --> 00:00:04,750
You just step right through it.

4
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,980
So we start off with s.

5
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,895
S is going to be the number of points in the minimal set, okay?

6
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:13,000
P: the probability of success.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,700
This is, I wanted to have probability of p,

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:22,150
that at least one of my samples will be a correct set of points.

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,400
Now e, we said before, is the proportion of outliers.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,910
So, what's the proportion of inliers?

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,020
Well, if the proportion of outliers is 20%,

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,470
the inliers is 80%, just 1 minus e, okay?

13
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,300
All right, now we start with just a little bit of combinatorics, all right?

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,170
So, let's suppose I pick s of these things.

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,810
What's the probability that they're all inliers?

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,440
Well, if the pro, probability of in, being inlier is 1 minus e,

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,950
the probability that they're, all s are inliers is 1 minus e to the s.

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,560
I'm assuming that there are a lot of points to choose from.

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,695
So, that the fact that I pulled one out doesn't diminish things.

20
00:00:59,695 --> 00:01:01,790
It, it's a pretty good approximation.

21
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,680
Okay, so that's the probability that all of

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,790
the points in the sample I pulled are inliers.

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,580
So, what's the probability that at least one of those is an outlier?

24
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,870
Well, 1 minus that.

25
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,490
Okay, so that's just 1 minus 1 minus e to the s, okay?

26
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:28,030
So, if I pull out n sets, what's the probability that all n are outliers?

27
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,170
Well, given that my sets are independent, so

28
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:35,410
it's just this 1 minus, 1 minus e to the s, all raised to the n, okay?

29
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:40,380
So, that's the probability that all n samples have an outlier.

30
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,960
Okay. But, of course,

31
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,680
what we want is the probability that all of them are outliers.

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,040
So that means they were all bad.

33
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,000
We want that probability to be really small.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,370
That is, less than 1 minus the probability of, of the success.

35
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,670
So judging here, right.

36
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,370
So if p here was 99%, 1 minus p would be 1%.

37
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,700
We want the probability that they were,

38
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,949
all of our samples had at least one outlier in them.

39
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:13,280
We want that to be less than 1%.

40
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,100
So that means that we can now just substitute in.

41
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,860
And we get this ugly expression,

42
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,440
1 minus 1 minus e to the s to the N has to all be less than 1 minus p.

43
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,000
Drum roll, please.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,480
We can solve for N and bingo.

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,920
There is our equation.

46
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,770
N's gotta be greater than the log of 1 minus p divided by the log of 1 minus

47
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,360
1 minus e to the s.

48
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,420
And I'm sure you all have deep intuitions for what that looks like.

49
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,710
No? Okay, let's look at some representative values.
