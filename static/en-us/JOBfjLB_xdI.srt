2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
There's a statement here that is executed. This s equals 0.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There's a statement here that's print s.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Those get executed. That's for a total of 2.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is one statement that is executed 10 times--so 10, 11, 12 for a total of 12.
