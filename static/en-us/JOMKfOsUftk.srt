00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,868
This conic section would just be a circle. Great work if you chose that one.

2
00:00:04,868 --> 00:00:09,668
Just like before, we want to get the X squared term on the same side as the y

3
00:00:09,668 --> 00:00:14,902
squared term. So we can add x squared to both sides of the equation to get this

4
00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:19,240
equation. Now, you might not be used to seeing, the y squared term come first,

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,084
and in fact, we can reverse the order of addition since it's commutative. Two

6
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:28,764
plus one would be the same thing as one plus two. So y squared plus x squared

7
00:00:28,764 --> 00:00:33,275
is the same as x squared plus y squared. And just to be sure, I'll show you

8
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:36,155
each of these equations graphed, so we see that they represent the same exact

9
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:41,442
circle. This is the first one, this is the second one, and this is the third

10
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:46,410
one. All three circles are exactly the same.
