00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,328
Storing our friends in an ArrayList instead of a string made it easier for us

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:07,967
to add some useful features. Now friends can have spaces in their names and I

3
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:11,710
can have multiple friends with the same name. It's easy to answer questions

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:16,149
like, how many friends does someone have or who is the fifth friend on my list?

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,872
But you may have noticed that we haven't touched the un-friend method. For that

6
00:00:19,872 --> 00:00:24,370
we would need to modify the ArrayList, back to Kai to tell us how to do that.
