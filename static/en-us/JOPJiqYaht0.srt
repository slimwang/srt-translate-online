00:00:00,142 --> 00:00:04,890
Suppose an attacker enters this
malicious string as the user name.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,170
What's going to happen?

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,430
The actual SQL query
sent from the web server

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,700
to the backup database server
would look like this, and

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,810
the result of running this query to
database is to delete all user records.
