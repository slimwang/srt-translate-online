00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,220
A home router is a teeny
tiny example of a router.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,370
An ISP or a datacenter might have a
router that looks like a big chunky box

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,740
with a lot of cables going into it.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,670
In general, a router is a device that
connects two different IP networks.

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,170
It acts as a gateway.

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,380
Hosts on one network that want to
send traffic to the other one,

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,920
forward that traffic through the router.

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,480
While most hosts might
have only one interface

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,740
with an interesting IPv4 address on it,
a router will have two or more.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,500
The host on a local network
knows about a default gateway,

11
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,710
which is a router that's connected
toward the rest of the Internet.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,830
Computers that are attached to the same
switch or WiFi access point or

13
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,680
other network hardware
are normally local to each other.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,180
They can directly send packets
to one another without

15
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,320
going through a different network.

16
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,390
And as we saw before they have IP
addresses on the same net block.

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,186
But here is Alice over
here at 192.0.2.104.

18
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:10,192
And here's Chandra over
here at 198.51.100.17.

19
00:01:10,192 --> 00:01:12,280
Those aren't on the same local network.

20
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,220
So if this host wants to
send traffic over here,

21
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,580
it has to pass through this router.

22
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,470
That default gateway may also
have a default gateway itself.

23
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,720
But eventually as you go toward
the rest of the Internet,

24
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,580
you'll eventually reach
the defaultless part.

25
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,590
Where routers on major transit ISPs
know about the global routing table,

26
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,570
the directory of all public IP networks.

27
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,380
Routers up there don't
have default gateways.
