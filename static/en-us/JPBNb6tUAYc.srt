1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, we certainly have to know the score.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We have to know how much is pending, because that's going to affect the score.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We have to know what player is playing.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now these things, what happened before, they might be interesting,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but they don't really help us to find the current state.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So those are unnecessary.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So, the state's going to end up being something like a four tuple.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I've written it as p, me, you, pending, the player to move, that player's score,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the other player's score, and the pending score that hasn't been reaped yet.
