1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The answer is 0.99998. There are 2 ways to solve this.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
One is to sum these two. Not too hard to do.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The other way to solve it is to use the complementary event property,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
which makes the math a little easier in this case.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That property is that we know the sum of all possible events has to be 1.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Instead of computing P valid by adding the probabilities of heads and tails,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
we can compute it by subtracking from 1 the probability of events not invalid,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
which is the probability of E, which is 0.00002.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That would get us the same answer.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The property that we're using to do this is the complementary even property.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What it states is that for any event A, the probability of that event

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and the probability of the complement of that event--

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
that is of that not happening--is equal to 1.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What not-A here means is that elements in the universe minus the elements in A.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This is set subtraction. We can think of that like this.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is our universe if we have some event A all outcomes that are not part of a

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
must be the complement of A.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's what you get by removing A from the probability set.
