00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,650
The job of the moderator, in addition to those already mentioned, concerning

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,000
preparation and follow-up, include the following. The moderator should determine

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,990
whether the participants have done the necessary preparatory work. If necessary,

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,740
the moderator should abort the review if the team is not prepared. Why,

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,410
after all, go through an expensive meeting if it's not going to be effective?

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,510
The moderator should also evaluate whether the work to be reviewed is actually

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:27,770
ready for review. Let's say it's a code review. And the organization has

8
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,240
guidelines that say, before code review the code must be completed,

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,960
it must be successfully compiled and it must go through unit tests,

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,940
the moderator can then check whether those events have happened and

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,180
if not, send it back and reschedule the meeting. A moderator is responsible for

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,610
running the meeting. Keeping the participants on track, arbitrating any

13
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,420
differences, and managing time. Moderation is a skilled activity and

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,390
moderators typically have under, undergone some kind of training at the task.

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,260
Finally, moderators should be technically competent, but

16
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,720
not necessarily expert on the specific artifact of technology being reviewed.
