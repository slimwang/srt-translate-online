1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,469
Here's what we came up with.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:06,720
Remember, this is by no means
the only way to build this site.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,600
I'm sure your sites look totally
different than this one.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,520
And that is totally cool.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,690
Like always,
when I started working on this.

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,630
I started with a small viewport.

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,530
At a glance the most
noticeable improvement.

8
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,130
Is the fact that the text
is now a lot larger.

9
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,060
This is a nice change,
to help improve readability.

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,290
As to the new location column
in the sports score table, well,

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,090
it disappeared on mobile.

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,330
When there's enough room for
the locations, I went ahead and

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,830
added Display Block, to the location
class to make them show back up.

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,430
When the viewport is now
in the desktop range.

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,040
I decided to shrink the text in
the Sports table, to make room for

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,300
the location.

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,830
While I would rather
make a totally different,

18
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:55,110
snazzier table to make everything fit,
I thought that making the font smaller

19
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,090
was a nice compromise to keep all
the information I wanted in the table.

20
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,250
Next on my list of changes
is the Latest News section.

21
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,519
In the old version,

22
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,080
I didn't really like the way the text
was wrapping around these images.

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,610
And I also didn't like the fact that
these images were just so small.

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,550
I decided to give myself
a little bit of flexibility.

25
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,890
So I turned each article or
snippet, into a flexbox.

26
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,410
You can tell that at the smallest screen
size, I've totally dropped the thumbnail

27
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,650
images, and I've gone ahead and
cropped the text to three lines.

28
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,190
Adding this ellipses here to
the end of the last line,

29
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,260
isn't super simple actually.

30
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,470
So if you want to do the same,

31
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,450
I suggest starting with the link that
you can find in the instructor notes.

32
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,520
As the page gets wider,

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,840
the images show back up, and
they scale with the width of the page.

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,910
Next up, I tackle the thumb
nail images for the articles.

35
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,620
Originally, these images were being
scaled down from an image that

36
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,440
was something like 2000 by 1400 pixels,
which is just absolutely massive.

37
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,400
And way too big for this use.

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,490
So I used image processing software,
to scale the image down to

39
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,900
twice the resolution of the largest
resolution thumbnails could take.

40
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,190
With this layout, thumbnails don't get
any larger than 245 by 164 pixels.

41
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,340
High density displays,
need higher density images.

42
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,620
So, I scaled the image
down to 490 by 327 pixels,

43
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,780
which is a much smaller file.

44
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,070

images responsively and

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:31,680

Course, made by Google's Sam Dutton.

46
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,790
For the final version of this project.

47
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,230
I put all of my code in to final.css.

48
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,390
It's essentially just
a series of breakpoints, and

49
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,980
then small changes to the snippets and
scores.

50
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,470
I'm not going to go in-depth
to my code at the moment.

51
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,770
But the instructor notes,
has instructions on how to download and

52
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,170
play with my source code.

53
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,160
All in all, I'm pretty happy with
my copy of The Brighton Times.

54
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,520
But, this is just my layout.

55
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,230
I want to see what you've done, too.

56
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,810
Make sure that you post all
of your sites in the forums.
