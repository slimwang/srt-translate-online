1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,019
For this quiz, I want you to imagine
that you're a graphic designer.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,263
A friend asks you to to make a 50 meter,
or a 165 foot banner,

3
00:00:08,263 --> 00:00:09,818
made for a skyscraper.

4
00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:12,527
The banner will have some
kind of company logo here and

5
00:00:12,527 --> 00:00:14,360
then some text next to it.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,600
So should you give your friend
a vector or a raster image?

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,290
And why?

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,029
Should it be a vector because
the file size is smaller?

9
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:26,074
Should it be a vector because it will
scale without quality degradation?

10
00:00:26,074 --> 00:00:29,161
Should it be a raster image because
the file size will be smaller?

11
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:32,189
Or should it be a raster image
because it will scale without quality

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,310
degradation?

13
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,140
Pick one of these four.
