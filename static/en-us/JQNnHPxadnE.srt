1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's take a look at the last type of market, it's the clone market.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This takes foreign business models and adapts it to local conditions.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What's a foreign business model--typically right now,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
a foreign business model is one that's occurring in the US.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What's a local condition?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, if the language is different than English or your culture is different than the US

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
or if your country has import restrictions or your local control and ownership

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and you have a market large enough to support a business model.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Typically, a country's worth more than 100 million people that fit this criteria

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
might be China, India, Russia, Brazil--even though EU itself; just cloning US

11
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
business models that exist is not a bad business strategy.
