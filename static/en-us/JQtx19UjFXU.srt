1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,170
So this one is intended
to be kind of a warmup.

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,440
So you might want to go just
with your intuition on this.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,920
So what would you think the value of Q
prime (s,a) is as a function of Q(s,a).

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,570
Keep in mind that we
scaled all the rewards up.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,160
Think of it like by
a factor of a thousand.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,500
>> My intuition about that is
actually pretty straight forward.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,940
What I want it to be is just

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,960
I want Q prime of s,a just
to be c times Q of s,a.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,410
>> In other words,
if we double all of the rewards,

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,160
it should double all of the Q values.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,420
If we halve all of the rewards,
it should halve all of the Q values.

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,009
That sort of thing.

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,760
>> Right and that makes sense at least
to me conceptually if nothing else.

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,760
Reward is your reward and
the Q value is the true reward you get.

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,730
The summation of all of
the rewards you're going to get.

16
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,370
So, if I double the rewards,
then I should double the value.

17
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,910
>> Yeah that's good.

18
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,400
So that is the right answer.

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,490
And I just want to go through a quickie
derivation to show why that's the case.

20
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,020
Alright so here's how I like to think
about this is what we want to show

21
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,660
is that our Bellman equation for
Q prime and R prime is correct,

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,470
that it solves and we get a solution
to the Bellman equation and

23
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,070
since the bellman equation is unique,
the solution

24
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,930
to the bellman equation is unique, then
we must have found the right solution.

25
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,860
So what I did here was I took you
know imagine the Bellman equation

26
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,550
for q prime.

27
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,670
It's like q prime s a equals r
prime s a plus gamma q prime.

28
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,470
So what I'm going to substitute in here
is our guess as to what Q prime is so

29
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,880
that is here and here.

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,830
And our definition as to what
R prime is, which is that.

31
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:37,080
Okay so if this is true, then we have
a solution to the Bellman equation.

32
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,140
>> Right and it's derivitively true.

33
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,800
>> Right.
And so why is this true.

34
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,530
Right because the C here we
can pull it out of the max.

35
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,480
That doesn't, again because C is
positive, it doesn't influence the max.

36
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,680
If c were 0 or
negative it would mess up the max.

37
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,960
But we can factor it out of
the max because it's positive so

38
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,490
it doesn't change the order.

39
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,570
Of what's largest.

40
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,840
It's going to then get multiplied by
these C's, and it's inside the sum, but

41
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,880
it's common to everything in the sum,
so that gets pulled out there, so

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,000
we actually get to move this C
all the way out to here, and now,

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,740
notice that we can factor it out, well,
it's obvious now, I guess, right?

44
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,250
We just factor the C out from
both sides, and they cancel.

45
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,960
So what we are left
with is this equation,

46
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,090
which is the Bellman equation
that we had already solved.

47
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,970
So this has to be true, so
the original thing has to be true.

48
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,170
>> Right.

49
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:26,740
That makes sense.

50
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,660
>> Yeah, which is probably
the way you think about it.

51
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,460
>> Yeah, in fact this is exactly
the way I would think about it.

52
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,040
>> Awesome!

53
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,960
All right so

54
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,860
now that we have this down we should be
able to do these other modifications.

55
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,630
The other messing around with
the reward function next.
