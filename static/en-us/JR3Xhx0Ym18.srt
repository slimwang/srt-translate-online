00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,450
In this session we're going to open
up a new way of thinking about how

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,360
code is executed.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,550
We're going to talk about functions,
a core concept in programming.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,500
Functions allow us to package code into
units of behavior that can be executed

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,490
over and over again.

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,190
And they're particularly useful for
enabling us

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,609
to organize our code into distinct
chunks that accomplish specific tasks.

8
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:22,689
Without further ado let's get started.
