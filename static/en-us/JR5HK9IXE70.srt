00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,290
Now you might be like, XML isn't there
a way in which I can avoid having to add

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:11,050
more code into another language XML,
just to avoid more Java code in my app?

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,230
Well, there is something we can use.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,530
As we mentioned before,
Android Studio comes with a full

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,960
featured visual layout editor which
is accessed through the design tab.

6
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:25,759
This layout editor allows us to place
all sorts of stuff onto our layouts.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,650
Such as view the displayed text, or

8
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:32,909
images, add a text, or
have interactive buttons.

9
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:36,459
We often refer to these single
purpose views as widgets.

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,365
Let's create a new project for this one.

11
00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:40,700
[BLANK_AUDIO]

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,450
This is a bit of a free form exercise,

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,310
meaning that your solution doesn't
have to be exactly the same as ours.

14
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,163
We're going to practice building
a layout using the layout editor and

15
00:00:50,162 --> 00:00:51,539
the ConstraintLayout.

16
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,472
[BLANK_AUDIO]

17
00:00:57,472 --> 00:01:01,978
A ConstraintLayout is a special kind of
layout that uses complex constraints on

18
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,524
the child views to allow for

19
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:06,700
dynamic layouts that respect
different window sizes.

20
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:16,890
[BLANK_AUDIO]

21
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,423
So we added ConstraintLayout
to the project and

22
00:01:19,423 --> 00:01:23,359
we changed the root layout of our main
activity to be a ConstraintLayout.

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,850
The editor has some special buttons and
controls for

24
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:28,409
building the ConstraintLayout.

25
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,170
We're going to turn off the second
one that looks like a magnet,

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,030
that automatically creates
constraints as we change things.

27
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,378
Let's switch to landscape mode.

28
00:01:38,378 --> 00:01:41,129
Keep dragging stuff around and adding
views until you end up with a layout

29
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:43,659
that looks approximately like this one.

30
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:45,840
Or just design something
cool on your own.

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,219
Proud of your creation?

32
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:48,620
Post in in the forums.

33
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,758
There's a really cool code lab
if you want to learn more about

34
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:53,463
ConstraintLayout in the link.

35
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:57,170
But we'll cover it in more detail later
on when were fine tuning our UI design.
