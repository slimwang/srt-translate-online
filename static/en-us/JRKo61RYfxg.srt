Nice work on functions up to this point. Now let's try this thing called the

2
00:00:04,677 --> 00:00:08,757
composition of functions. The composition of a function is when we use two or

3
00:00:08,757 --> 00:00:16,315
more functions together. The notation looks like this, f of g of x. Notice that

4
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:22,270
this symbol is not a multiplication sign. It's a small open circle, that means

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:28,915
the composite of g functions. It kind of looks like fog. But we really read

6
00:00:28,915 --> 00:00:34,790
this as f of g of x. To see what's happening here, let's look at some function

7
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:40,508
machines. F of x will be a function that triples a number and g of x will be a

8
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:47,884
function that adds 5 a number. So, we're going to start by finding the f of g

9
00:00:47,884 --> 00:00:54,195
of 3. What this means is, we want to find the output of g of 3 and use that as

10
00:00:54,195 --> 00:01:01,454
the input for f of x. In other words, we'll get some output here for plugging

11
00:01:01,454 --> 00:01:06,835
in 3 into g. Then we'll take this output, and plug it into f to get a new

12
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:14,448
output. So, we know g of 3, we simply take 3 and plug it in for x. So g of 3

13
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:21,945
would equal 8. So, now just really want to find the f of 8. We take the output

14
00:01:21,945 --> 00:01:27,496
of g of 3, and plug that into f, so letting x equal 8 for this function, we'll

15
00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:36,561
have 3 times 8 which equals 24. This is f of g of 3. Knowing this, what do you

16
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:40,970
think would be f of g of 5? Enter that number here.
