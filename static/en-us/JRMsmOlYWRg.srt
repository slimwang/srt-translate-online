00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,880
Building little demos is fun and

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,590
all, but building a real game
is a whole different beast.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,689
It's like assembling a fine watch,
there's so

4
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:11,160
many moving pieces to keep track of, and
integrate, and so many interactions have

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,710
to be frictionless,
lest the whole thing grind to a halt.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,670
And guess what?

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,630
You've done it.

8
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,980
You've brought Gigigal to life in all
her platform jumping, cannon shooting,

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,780
robot destroying glory.

10
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,080
I can't wait to see how you choose
to extend what we've built here.

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,250
Will you add a level select screen,
add new types of enemies,

12
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,130
add different types of
weapons maybe a boss battle?

13
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,060
The possibilities are as endless as
your imagination now that you've

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,840
got the skills to bring
your ideas to life.
