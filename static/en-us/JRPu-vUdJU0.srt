1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now what happens in the network is

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
at each time step a new block is created

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
that validates all the transactions in that block.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
At the point where this block is created,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
this has to be the longest block chain.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's the way that Bob can validate

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that this was a valid spend.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Someone could try to create an alternate block chain.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So if Bob wants to spend the coin twice,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
what Bob would need to do is create a chain

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that's longer than the longest chain.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
When a transaction's validated by the network,

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
all the signatures in the coin are checked.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This is using the transfer chain,

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but to prevent double spending

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
there's also a check of this chain of blocks.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And the check is: the longest chain is the one that's viewed as correct.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So each peer in the network might see a different view of this chain of blocks.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If they see different views, the one that has the longest chain

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
is the one that will be viewed as the most correct view of all the transactions.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So every participant in the network

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
is effectively keeping track of all transactions.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And the version of all transactions that people trust the most

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
is the one with the longest chain,

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and if an adversary wants to create a longer chain

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
with a different view of transactions--

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
so if Bob wants to double spend this coin and, say,

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
give the same coin to both Cathy and Doug,

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
what Bob would need to do is create a longer chain

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that convinces Doug that this is the correct view of the network

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and this view is incorrect.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So that requires finding these hash values.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If the power of the network exceeds the power of the adversary,

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
well then it's likely the network will have

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
a longer chain than the adversary can produce.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Keep in mind, the motivation for producing this attack

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
is just to be able to double spend one coin.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There's still the chain of public key signatures

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
that validates the transfers of each coin.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So the resources that you would need to spend to produce a longer chain

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to convince someone that you didn't spend that coin

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
in the other chain, which is now the one that would've included the previous spend

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
is to find these hash values quicker than the network can.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Then centers are set up in such a way

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
to make it unlikely that someone will want to do that

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
since if you do find that next hash value in the chain,

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you can create a new block, which is worth 50 bit coins

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If you create a longer chain

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
trying to catch up to the chain that the network has,

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
that's going to require a lot more computing resources,

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and would only allow you to respend

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
the bit coins that you already owned.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So this doesn't provide anonymity in the traditional sense.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It avoids the need for a central authority,

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
but each transaction is known to everyone in the network.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The way to provide some anonymity is,

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
instead of using your actual names in the transactions,

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
you can have different identities for each transaction.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So this is gonna be some new identity.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It will still need to have a certificate

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
that validates the public key for that,

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
but it doesn't need to be tied to Alice's identity

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
in any way that's visible to anyone else.

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So that's the way to provide some anonymity,

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
even though all the transactions in the network are public

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
to everyone who participates.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So this actually works.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
There's at least a reasonable number of people

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
that trust this currency

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and are providing computation

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
to create these blocks,

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
which is incentivized by creating the value of new bit coins.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There's about 9 million bit coins currently available.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And the marketplace fluctuates, and it depends on cost of computation

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
as well as the trust in the bit coin network.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There have been some incidents where the price fluctuated wildly

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
because there was some concern about the security of the bit coin transaction site

78
00:03:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but the current market is fairly stable around $5 for a bit coin.
