1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,140
For example, if we have packets arriving in this queue destined

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,660
for the orange queue, at the front of the queue, then

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,360
even with the speed up, there may be packets that are

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,850
sufficiently far behind in the queue that they're waiting behind the

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,940
orange packets. What we'd like to be able to do is

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,980
perform matchings to allow these packets to be sent to the

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,080
output ports, and not have to wait for the entire queue

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,000
to be drained of packets destined for the orange output port.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,460
A solution is to create virtual output queues, where instead of having a single

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,780
queue at the input, we have one queue per output port. This prevents packets

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,040
at the front of the queue that are destined for a particular output port

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,620
from blocking packets that could otherwise be

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,990
matched to other output queues in earlier timeslots.
