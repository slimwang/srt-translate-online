1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,230
Now let's take a few minutes to unpack the words, library and framework.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,820
Now, this is another difficult topic to cover because of the inconsistencies.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:14,410
You see, it's not a single person or entity defining these two words.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,620
It's a community.

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,620
And so, the usages of these words in the community can be a lot more loose.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,810
Now, you may have heard the word framework used when describing CSS frameworks.

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,220
But we're going to remove those from the discussion.

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,070
CSS frameworks generally are not JavaScript, although they sometimes include it.

9
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,430
And including CSS frameworks in the discussion just confuses everything.

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,960
From here on forth, I'm just talking about purely JavaScript libraries.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,250
So, what's a library?

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,500
A library is just a bunch of JavaScript that someone else or

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,820
some other people wrote, packaged up, and distributed.

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,870
Or in fact, it could be JavaScript that you wrote and packaged up.

15
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,730
There are a lot of things we do over and

16
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:04,030
over again as developers, like making AJAX requests and manipulating the DOM.

17
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,250
And as we do this again and

18
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,530
again, we don't want to have to keep writing the same code over and over again.

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,640
In this case here, I've decided not to rewrite it three more times for

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,220
three more projects.

21
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,390
And instead, I set aside this AJAX code for reuse in all of my projects.

22
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,780
Libraries take it one step further.

23
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,220
Rather than have every developer write their own AJAX function,

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,350
why not just make an AJAX library and distribute it freely for everyone to use?

25
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,150
And while we're at it,

26
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,010
why not make a library that makes DOM manipulation easier too?

27
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,070
Now, that's exactly what people actually do.

28
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,090
If you search on the web, you'll find all kinds of AJAX libraries and

29
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,800
all kinds of DOM manipulation libraries.

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,320
jQuery is a great example of a library for

31
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,830
DOM manipulation, AJAX, and much more.

32
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,630
Now, don't be confused by all of my colors here.

33
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,494
All I'm bringing out is that jQuery has an AJAX library built into it and

34
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,429
a DOM manipulation library built into it.

35
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:06,009
If you really wanted to, you could probably separate these things out and

36
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:09,020
make them work separate from the rest of jQuery.

37
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,940
We're not going to do that, but it is important to keep in mind that everything

38
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,320
in jQuery is just some JavaScript that some other people wrote already.

39
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,790
And we can use it rather than rewriting all of its functionality from

40
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,770
scratch ourselves.

41
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,410
And what's more, the good libraries will often make allowances for older

42
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,210
browsers, abstracting away some of the browser differences and issues so you can

43
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:36,120
spend time focusing on building your app rather than supporting older browsers.

44
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,690
So, now we know what a library is.

45
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,890
It's just a bunch of code that someone else wrote that we can use in

46
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,340
our application.

47
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,400
Now, when we talk about libraries and frameworks in this class,

48
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,530
we're generally talking about organizational libraries and frameworks.

49
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,550
And jQuery here is not an organizational library.

50
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,000
It does give us a bunch of useful great methods.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,150
But it doesn't give us anything to help us organize our code.
