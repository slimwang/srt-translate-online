1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,120
So those are our discreet gradients, but now we said we wanted an operator.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,460
Right, we want to mask our kernel that can implement these gradients.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,920
So here's an example of an operator H.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,720
And I'm going to use three rows, and I'll tell you why in just a minute.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,860
For now we only have these two columns.

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,270
So the question is, is this a good operator?

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,070
>> No. >> No, it's not a good operator.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,030
Why is it not a good operator?

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,520
Well there's a couple reasons.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,890
One of which is there is no middle pixel.

11
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:32,049
So it's hard for me to say that this pixels value because the question is

12
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,860
what's special about the right.

13
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,060
It's should be, I could also be able to go to the left.

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,580
So, if I wanted to do that what might I do?

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,440
Well, I might do an operation that looks like that.

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm going to go to the right here, and the left there.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,960
Now, you might ask yourself why is it a plus a half and minus a half.

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,500
>> Why is it?

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,320
>> No, ask yourself, don't ask me.

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,020
Well, okay, here's why.

21
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,920
It's the average of the right derivative and the left derivative.

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,770
And what I mean by that is, the right derivative would be a plus one here, and

23
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,710
a minus one there, okay.

24
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,120
The left derivative would be a plus one here, and a minus one there.

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,550
If I wanted to average them, I would add them and divide by two.

26
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:25,460
So, I add them I get minus 1, 0, 1, and then when I divide by 2.

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,990
I get minus one-half and plus one-half, with a 0 in the middle.

28
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,690
So that's why this thing that goes plus a half to the right minus a half to

29
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,190
the left is the average of the left and right derivatives.

30
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:38,940
Get it?

31
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,440
Cool.
