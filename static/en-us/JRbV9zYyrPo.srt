1
00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:07,514
And the answer here is no. The square root
of 208 is 14.422205

2
00:00:07,615 --> 00:00:12,374
and I could go on. I could keep writing, but this decimal

3
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:17,765
actually extends on and on forever,without any sort of pattern that repeats.

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,930
This is different from any of the other kinds of numbers we've talked about so far, and

5
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:28,318
all of those numbers have been rational numbers. Now we need a different category, the rational numbers.
