1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,430
So here's what we're going to do.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,450
It turns out that it's sort of
complicated to keep track of where all

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,930
the max's and
the differences are in absolutes.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,510
So we're going to make
a simplifying assumption, which is,

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,740
that the largest value in
our f function is bigger or

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,460
equal to the largest
value in our g function.

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,670
And I'm going to say we're going to
assume that without loss of generality.

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,740
Why is that okay?

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,040
>> Because if it weren't true,
we'd just swap f and g around.

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:26,800
>> Yeah, that's all.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,330
I mean, we'll just call f.

12
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,680
Of the two functions
that we're comparing.

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,170
Call f the one that has the larger
max or larger or equal.

14
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,200
I guess, if they were equal.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,620
If the maxes on the two were equal,
then it doesn't matter.

16
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,400
But we want f to have
the larger of the two.

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,180
What's that's going to do is going to
simplify some of our thinking with

18
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,610
the absolute value symbols.

19
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,690
Because otherwise,
the case analysis get's really tedious.

20
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,400
>> Hm, we can't have that.

21
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,850
Okay, I can't wait to
see where this goes.

22
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,030
>> All right, so ultimately,

23
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,350
we're going to be trying to compare
this quantity to this quantity.

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,550
So let's start off writing
this quantity on the left.

25
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,430
And then we're going to reduce it

26
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,319
step by step until we get
the quantity on the right.

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,140
So here's where we start.

28
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,120
What can we do with this?

29
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,830
Well given that we know that the max
of f(a) is bigger than the max of g(a),

30
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,260
because that's we were assuming
when we named f and g.

31
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,470
We can get rid of the absolute
value signs, yay.

32
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,270
>> Mm.

33
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,200
>> Now, because we're finally going
to come clean on this issue that

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,110
you were talking about before, which is
that these are kind of different a's.

35
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,280
And it would be good,
if we gave them different names.

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,180
So let's actually do that.

37
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,671
Let's actually say that,

38
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:39,605
a1 is argmax f(a) and a2 is argmax g(a).

39
00:01:39,605 --> 00:01:40,653
>> Mm-hm.

40
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,670
>> So now we can rewrite this different,

41
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,300
max a f(a) minus max a g(a),
much more simply.

42
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,930
And it's just the difference between the
corresponding values in the function.

43
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,350
>> Sure.
>> All right, so

44
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,650
if you let me get away with that,
now you're in trouble,

45
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,830
because the next step is going to
follow pretty easily from this.

46
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,930
But it's going to take us
into a whole new realm.

47
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,570
So now, we said that this quantity
is equal to the difference

48
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,960
at a1 of the f function and
the value at a2 of the g function.

49
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,510
So since this a2 was chosen
to maximize the g function,

50
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,100
then any other a that we
could substitute in here,

51
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,940
let's just say a1, can only make this
smaller, or it can make it no bigger.

52
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,480
>> Right.

53
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,770
>> All right, so the g(a2) versus g(a1),

54
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,160
g(a1) is going to be smaller than or
equal to g(a2).

55
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,150
>> Yeah.

56
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,720
>> But since we're negating that in this
equation, that means it can only make

57
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,920
this quantity smaller than or
equal to the previous quantity.

58
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,070
>> That's That's kind of amazing.

59
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,940
That's a neat trick.

60
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,570
>> Right?
But

61
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,900
intuitively, does this piece
feel okay intuitively now?

62
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,714
Essentially what we're doing is, we're
taking the place where f is maximized at

63
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:53,520
a1, and
the place where g is maximized at a2.

64
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,330
And we're just sliding over to a number
that's- Well here, think of it this way.

65
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,460
So I find this little piece helpful.

66
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,000
So because of our, without loss of
generality statement, if we think of

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,155
this as a number line, we have the f
value at a1 is the largest thing of all.

68
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,685
[LAUGH] It is the king.

69
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:11,440
>> Mm-hm.

70
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,250
>> The g value of a2 is
>> Some other large value, but

71
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,330
not as large as f(a1).

72
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,425
So if we switch from g(a2) to g(a1),

73
00:03:21,425 --> 00:03:24,325
we have to be going down or
at least not up.

74
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:24,970
>> Mm-hm.

75
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,580
>> And so if we look at
the difference between these two

76
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,530
quantities,
>> And the difference between

77
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,350
these two quantities, the difference
can only have gotten larger.

78
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,870
And that's what this
equation is showing,

79
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,310
that the difference can only have gotten
larger when we substituted in the a1.

80
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,960
>> Well that's not true.

81
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,280
It could stay the same.

82
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,189
So f(a1), g(a2), and
g(a1) could all be the same number.

83
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:53,780
But g(a2) cannot be bigger than f(a1),
and g(a1) cannot be bigger than g(a2).

84
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,530
>> Good.

85
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,460
>> No.
That's really clever.

86
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,340
This is cute.

87
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,810
This gets you a way of going from two
completely different variables to

88
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,890
one variable.

89
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,520
>> Right.

90
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,020
>> That's awesome.
