1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This kernel applied in this location over here will give me

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
a minus 1 times zero plus 1 times zero is zero.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Shift to the right you get minus 1 times 2 plus 2 times 1 to zero.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The absolute value of this is zero.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
On the right side we get zero again.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You get 100 over here, which is minus zero plus 100.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We get 98 over here, which is minus 4 plus 102.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And we get 100 over here, which is minus 100 over here plus zero,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which gives minus 100. We take the absolute, so it's 100.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You get 4 over here, which is minus zero plus 4 equals 4.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Zero over here. These two balance each other out.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Then another 4 over here. Minus 4 plus zero is minus 4.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Taking the absolute we get 4 over here.
