1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,080
So the answer is that we need to
consider a newer coordinate frame and

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,910
we would refer to this as
the homogeneous coordinate system.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,500
Basically what we want to do is
actually take the two dimensions

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,930
that we were looking at before,
the x, y, and

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,050
the x prime and the y prime,
and a two dimensional matrix M.

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,870
Let's start seeing if we can actually
represent this as a three vector.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,380
So so far we've looked at x and y.

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,310
So we want to be able to take
this two dimensional x y and

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,630
generate a new three vector.

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,980
We can basically refer to this as x y
and the third vector being 1, and for

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,970
just sake of completeness and

12
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,630
what we will do with it
next let's call this a w.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,770
So what we basically doing is
we adding a third coordinate to

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,740
every two dimensional point.

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,750
So and what we did basically is
now we're coming up with x, y, w.

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,640
And the thing we want to remember is
what basically w implies is again,

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,680
my two dimensional vector, except
that now we are dividing both x and

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,000
y with that third point here, w.

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,087
Now of course there are certain subtle
things we need to pay attention to.

20
00:01:05,087 --> 00:01:08,556
Here for example is my simple
two dimensional x and y.

21
00:01:08,556 --> 00:01:12,023
I can basically look at
this point here 2 and 1,

22
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:16,857
of course just looking at x 1,
y 1, the values would be 2 1.

23
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:20,730
Now just keeping this convention
in mind, if I had omega,

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,630
or w to be 1 this still makes
unreasonable sense 2, 1, 1 applies, but

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,633
then of course,
imagine I could work w to 2,

26
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:33,170
then 4, 2, 2 applies and
if I make w be 3, 6, 3, 3 applies.

27
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,760
So, this point now can be
represented by this three vector

28
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,350
in all three of these values.

29
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,880
One thing to note, w cannot be 0
because if you make this 0 x and

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,660
y also would actually go to infinities,

31
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,026
so of course when w is 0 we can
refer to that as an infinite point.

32
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:57,540
This point, 0, 0, 0 is not allowed
because we cannot have 0 over 0.

33
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,400
That would be an indeterminate point.

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,480
But all of a sudden, now we have
a lot of strength in our hands,

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,660
when we actually now create
this new coordinate system,

36
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,288
the homogeneous coordinate system,
with x, y, and w.

37
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:10,360
Let's see what that buys us.
