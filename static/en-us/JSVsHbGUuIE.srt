1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,900
So here are three scenarios, one where the data lies on a line like this,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,157
one where the data literally comes from a circle like that in a kind of very

3
00:00:08,157 --> 00:00:13,960
equal distribution in the X and Y axis, and one where the data falls vertical.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,400
And they're going to ask a couple of true or false questions here.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,750
First one, does the principal component analysis return a result?

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,500
Yes or no for either of these cases.
