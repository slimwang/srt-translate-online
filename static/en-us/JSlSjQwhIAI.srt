1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:06,022
Well you see that there are 3 samples of size 2 that will have an average of 3,

2
00:00:06,022 --> 00:00:12,036
and 2 samples of size 2 that will have an average of 3.5, and 1 sample of size 2

3
00:00:12,036 --> 00:00:18,944
that will have an average of 4. So 3 plus 2 plus 1 divided by the total number

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:26,944
of possible means, which is 16, will give us the probability and this is .375.
