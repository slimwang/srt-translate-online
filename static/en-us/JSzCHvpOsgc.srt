1
00:00:00,223 --> 00:00:02,214
And this here is our Delta T,

2
00:00:02,368 --> 00:00:07,562
over time, for Apple’s stock on May 6, 2010.

3
00:00:07,731 --> 00:00:10,360
And you’ll find during the day it trades very normally

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,668
and all of a sudden you get this amazing oscillation here

5
00:00:13,683 --> 00:00:16,204
of the stock first going down and then going up again

6
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:19,366
and that is really indicative of something bizarre happening.

7
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,541
And our statistic would have found it

8
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,486
and might have saved you some money.

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,246
So, that’s my example from financial data.

10
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:29,892
In the next few minutes we’re going to pick a different example.
