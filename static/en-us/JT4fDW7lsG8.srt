00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,229
The simplest feature you can get from
images consists of raw color values.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,100
For instance, here is an image of a car.

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,949
Let's say you want to find out whether
some region of a new test image

4
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:14,829
contains a car or not.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,230
What do you do?

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,089
Well, using your known car image as is,
you can simply find the image difference

7
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:27,939
between the car image, and the test
region and see the difference is small.

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,440
This basically means subtracting
the corresponding color values,

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,719
aggregating the differences and
comparing it with the threshold.

10
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,500
Alternatively, you could compute the
correlation between the car image and

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,520
test region and check if that is high.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,359
Either way, this general approach
is known as template matching.

13
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,839
Your known image is the template or

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,900
model and you try to match it
with regions of the test image.

15
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,390
Template matching does work in limited
circumstances but isn't very helpful for

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,450
our case.

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,170
Can you guess why?
