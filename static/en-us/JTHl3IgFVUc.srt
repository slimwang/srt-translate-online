1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,350
Let's consider now the real world,
and in particular hedge funds.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,210
So let's consider two real world funds.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,180
One is RenTec or
Renaissance Technologies,

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,930
it was founded by Jim Simons, a math and
computer since professor, and

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,489
he's had tremendous performance
over the last several decades,

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,040
and Warren Buffet,
who runs Berkshire Hathaway.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,720
Both of these funds over the years
have produced similar returns.

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,560
But on the one hand,
Warren Buffet holds maybe 120 stocks,

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,030
and he doesn't trade much,
he just holds them.

10
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,540
Renaissance technology trades
may be 100,000 times per day.

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,920
Can a single theory relate these two?

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,620
Can it account vastly widely
differing numbers of trades per year,

13
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,840
and can it relate the fact that
they have similar performance and

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,750
maybe different levels of skill?

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,500
How does that all work together?

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,540
Well, yes,
there is a theory that can relate them,

17
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,402
it's the fundamental law of
active portfolio management, and

18
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:09,970
I'm going to show it to
you in just a moment.
