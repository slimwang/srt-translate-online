00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,570
Google Cast is a technology that lets
you connect your application to the TV.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,310
The biggest and
most beautiful screen in the home.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,010
In this lesson,

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,570
we'll learn how to add Cast Support
to your existing Android app.

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,120
We'll cover the basics of
sender receiver topology, and

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,120
show them in action by adding Cast
Support to the Universal Media Player.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,600
Here's how UAMP looks when we start.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,750
And here it is after we've added Cast.

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,308
Now you'll be able to do this.

10
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:31,820
That's how easy it is to Cast
your app to the big screen.

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,400
Now as Timothy mentioned,
the average TV viewer spends about

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,630
three hours a day in front
of their television.

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,940
Google Cast is an opportunity for
you to capture that time and

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,130
engage with your users in new and
exciting ways.
