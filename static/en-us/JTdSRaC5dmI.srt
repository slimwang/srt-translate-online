1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,242
We covered a number of topics so far.

2
00:00:03,242 --> 00:00:05,990
But you'll see that all of
them have focused on problems

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,830
that we address in the context
of a single computer.

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,830
Unfortunately, a single computer
is not very interesting by itself.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,100
It has to be connected to a network.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,670
And when we connect
computer to our networks,

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,740
that brings in a whole bunch
of new security problems.

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,860
That's where we're going to go on
to the second part of the course.

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,370
We have a world-class
network security researcher

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,900
who's actually going to take you there.

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,370
>> For part of this course,

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,190
we're going to cover a number of
major topics in network security.

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,950
We're going to start off with
malware and network defenses.

14
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,042
Then we're going to move on topography,
security protocols, web security and

15
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:41,037
mobile security.
