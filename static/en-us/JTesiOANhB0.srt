00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,150
In an image, perspective is
the phenomenon where an object appears

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,230
smaller the farther away it is from
a viewpoint like a camera, and

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,560
parallel lines appear
to converge to a point.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,839
It's seen in everything
from camera images to art.

5
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,859
Many artist use perspective to give the
right impression of an object's size,

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,230
depth, and position when viewed
from a particular point.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,750
And let's look at perspective
in this image of the road.

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,839
As you can see,
the lane looks smaller and

9
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:33,460
smaller the farther away it gets from
the camera, and the background scenery

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,730
also appears smaller than the trees
closer to the camera in the foreground.

11
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:42,009
Mathematically, we can characterize
perspective by saying that,

12
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,512
in real world coordinates x, y, and z,

13
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:48,052
the greater the magnitude of
an objects z coordinate, or

14
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:52,361
distance from the camera, the smaller
it will appear in a 2D image.

15
00:00:52,362 --> 00:00:56,990
A perspective transform uses this
information to transform an image.

16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,120
It essentially transforms the apparent
z coordinate of the object points,

17
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,378
which in turn changes that
object's 2D image representation.

18
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,090
A perspective transform warps the image
and effectively drags points towards or

19
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,180
pushes them away from the camera to
change the apparent perspective.

20
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,940
For example, to change this into
a bird's eye view scene, we can

21
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,769
apply a perspective transform that
zooms in on the farther away objects.

22
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:26,479
This is really useful, because some
tasks, like finding the curvature of

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,500
a lane, are easier to perform on
a bird's eye view of an image.

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,760
Take this image of a road.

25
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,680
If we just looked at these lane edges,
the left line looks like it's

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,580
leaning and curving a little to
the right, but the right lane line

27
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:43,829
looks like it's leaning to
the left without much of a curve.

28
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,834
By doing a perspective transform and

29
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:50,549
viewing this same image from above, we
can see that the lanes are parallel and

30
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,340
both curve about the same
amount to the right.

31
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,670
So, a perspective transform
lets us change our perspective

32
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,980
to view the same scene from
different viewpoints and angles.

33
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,880
This could be viewing a scene
from the side of a camera,

34
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,786
from below the camera, or
looking down on the road from above.

35
00:02:05,786 --> 00:02:09,479
Doing a bird's-eye view transform
is especially helpful for

36
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,240
road images because it will also allow
us to match a car's location directly

37
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,540
with a map, since map's display roads
and scenery from a top down view.

38
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,229
The process of applying
a perspective transform

39
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:24,219
will be kind of similar to
how we applied undistortion.

40
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:25,000
But this time,

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,259
instead of mapping object points to
image points, we want to map the points

42
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:34,090
in a given image to different desired
image points with a new perspective.

43
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,150
And again, this perspective can be done
for all kinds of different viewpoints,

44
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,539
whether that's from above like with
a map or from different camera angles.

45
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:45,449
Next, I'll go through how to
apply a perspective transform to

46
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:48,209
view traffic signs from
different angles using open CV.
