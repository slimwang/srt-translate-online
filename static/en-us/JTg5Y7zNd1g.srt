1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,450
All right.
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,900
Today what we're going to do is having
just started talking about Video.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,100
We're going to start talking about,
Action Recognition or

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,340
Activity Recognition in Video.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,910
That's the processing of video.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,330
For generating,
generating some sort of label or, or

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,150
descriptor that tells
you what's going on.

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,680
So, there's a bit of a challenge in

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,020
activity recognition in
terms of terminology.

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,088
And there's no sort of universally
accepted terminology, and

11
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:32,093
I'll say some of this goes
back to the 70s, Hans Nagel,

12
00:00:32,093 --> 00:00:36,420
first started talking about events and
actions in history and things like that.

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,070
So, loosely, we're going to use
the definitions that I have here.

14
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,350
So, we talk about Events.

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,290
And the one thing about an event
is it's a single moment in time.

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:45,960
Right?
So

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,250
the moment a door closes or something
changes right, right in the imagery.

18
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,980
A typically we refer
to that as an event.

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,560
A little bit higher up perhaps thinking
is this basic idea of movements or

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,650
sometimes referred to as actions.

21
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,720
And these are I'm going to describe a,
sort of atomic movement patterns.

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,440
So you know, sitting down.

23
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,310
Or you know, waving or
something like that.

24
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,626
We've got a gesture-like, it's a,

25
00:01:13,626 --> 00:01:17,500
you could describe it as
a trajectory in some feature space.

26
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,820
Whether it's the feature space of the
joints of the body or some appearance.

27
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,200
It is it's a, it's a single thing.

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,340
And then at the higher level there's
this notion called Activity.

29
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,680
By the way the only reason it
says adopted from Venu and, and

30
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,280
myself not together I did the original
paper on movement activity and

31
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,890
action and it was wrong.

32
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,590
I mean wrong in the sense of in,
in hindsight had activity followed

33
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,590
by actions because I was thinking
of actions being a big scale thing.

34
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,710
And the field which like the paper for
a little while has sort of moved on and

35
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,550
we have this notion of, of movements.

36
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,910
And then actions and
then relay activity.

37
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:59,170
And activity is being sort of
composed of a series of actions or

38
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,310
a bunch of actions
happening at the same time.

39
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,702
Typically if you're looking
at some interactions

40
00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:07,050
among the group of people that
we thought of as an activity.

41
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,419
So one example.

42
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,960
Here's a thing taken from
some surveillance, work.

43
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,420
Some of this was shown at
the PETS conference lets see.

44
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,660
Performance Evaluation of Tracking and
Surveillance,

45
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,345
I think is what PETS stands for.

46
00:02:19,345 --> 00:02:22,570
There's been a lot of work lately on
just you know finding the person in

47
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,090
the image here and
have extracted them there.

48
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:30,170
And maybe looking at some interactions
between people in a train station.

49
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,140
The idea of basically being able to
watch an environment sometimes to be

50
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,850
able to inform authorities if
there's possible problem going on,

51
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,640
sometimes to do things forensically.

52
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,290
Right?
So something happened and

53
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,680
I'd like to look back over
the last eight hours of video and

54
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,210
find different kinds of things.
