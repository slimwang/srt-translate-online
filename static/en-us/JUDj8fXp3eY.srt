00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here we are down in our post function.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In our success case we want to behave a little differently.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What we want to do is make an art.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
A--that's going to be our art--

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
equals a new instance of art.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We're going to pass in title equals title

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and art equals art.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We don't need the pass in created.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Because of the auto<u>now</u>add, we'll automatically get that property.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So we're going to create a new instance,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and then to store this instance, we say a.put.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This will store our new art object in the database.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
When we're done, we're going to redirect to the front page

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
so we don't have that annoying reload message--

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the resubmit your form--if we hit reload.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay, so let's go ahead and give this a test.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Here I am in our browser.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Now what should happen is when we submit a valid title

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and piece of art text,

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
we should store it in our database.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, so I'm going to type in a title.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This title will be camel,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and then I'm going to put some art in our text box here,

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
which is a camel that I copied off of that ASCII art site,

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and I'm going to click submit.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I click submit.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We're back on the front page, so we think it worked,

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
but we really have no way of knowing for sure right now.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So let's add the rest of this feature,

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
which is going to draw our artwork at the bottom of our form.
