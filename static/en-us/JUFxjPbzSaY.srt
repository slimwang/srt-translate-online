1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,214
At this point, hopefully you feel like you can attack a new big

2
00:00:04,214 --> 00:00:08,606
investigation bring it within the scope of a statistical inference problem and

3
00:00:08,606 --> 00:00:12,563
then apply iterations of the QMV process to gradually hone a solution.

4
00:00:12,563 --> 00:00:14,994
You've seen a taste of what model building and

5
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:18,480
data analysis problems looks like in the real world.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,740
And how it is a continual process of investigation.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,070
Finding results and

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,140
then proposing new lines of investigation based upon those results.

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,630
Sometimes, retrying or adjusting previous decisions.

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,740
Specifically, we get the process going by iterating on

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,890
an initial question until we arrive at answers to the following.

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,150
What metrics will be used to capture the phenomenon?

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,211
What statistical inference problem will be examined?

14
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:49,258
What features will inform the inference problem?

15
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:53,204
Once we've determined how to measure the problem as well as what form of

16
00:00:53,204 --> 00:00:57,085
question we'll be answering, we enter the modeling phase in which we

17
00:00:57,085 --> 00:00:59,680
choose a method for answering this question.

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,944
This method should take advantage of structure within data to

19
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:06,330
achieve maximum effectiveness.

20
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,310
Lastly, once we've built the model, we evaluate how good the model is at

21
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,690
generalizing to the wider phenomenon in the validation phase.
