Hello, and welcome to this new lessons. In this lesson you will learn how your

2
00:00:03,458 --> 00:00:07,458
programs can make decisions. Let's look at an example. Here you have a typical

3
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:12,078
elevator panel, and yes elevators are controlled by computers these days. And

4
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:16,236
if you look at the buttons, you will notice that there are buttons for 10, 11,

5
00:00:16,236 --> 00:00:23,080
12 and then goes on with 14. so, there's no button for 13. and that's of course

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,176
because, many people are superstitious and don't want to be in the 13th floor

7
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:32,910
of a building. Now, contrary to popular belief, the 13th floor is not filled

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,046
with secret government offices. There actually is a 13th floor, they just call

9
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:43,942
it the 14th. So, the software that controls the elevator car needs to adjust

10
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:50,155
for this human foible. Here's how you can do that in Java. Let's say floor is

11
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:55,132
the number as provided by the user, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 or whatever, and now

12
00:00:55,132 --> 00:01:01,740
we want to compute that actual floor. Then we need to make a decision. In Java

13
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,519
you use the if statement to make decisions, and you enclose the condition in

14
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,508
parenthesis. Then you use a pair of braces, and inside you put the statement or

15
00:01:10,508 --> 00:01:16,435
statements that you want to have executed when this condition is true. So, if

16
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:21,290
the floor is greater than 13, then we want it to adjust by subtracting 1. On

17
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,322
the other hand, if the condition is false, then we'll carry out the actions in

18
00:01:25,322 --> 00:01:30,631
the else part of this statement. In which case, the actual floor number equals

19
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:35,195
the floor number without any adjustment. And that's all there is to it. Let's

20
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:39,970
go over the important parts again. The keyword if starts out the conditional

21
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,305
statement. The condition goes in here, and is surrounded by parentheses. If the

22
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:50,608
condition is true, then the part following the if is executed. And if the

23
00:01:50,608 --> 00:01:56,060
condition is false, then the part after the else clause is executed. Alright,

24
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,669
now it's your turn. In some Asian countries, it's not the number 13 that brings

25
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:04,498
bad luck, but the number 14. And those elevators wouldn't have a number 14. And

26
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:10,544
in fact, just to play it safe, some property owners eliminate both the 13 and

27
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:15,833
14. So, go ahead and modify the program in the next exercise so that it

28
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:21,793
translates the user selected number to the actual floor number. And know, there

29
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:26,050
are no hidden floors with secret government offices.
