00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Of course the percentage support for candidate A is 55%.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
To compute the margin of error, we will use the following formula.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
1.96 the quartile from the normal at 97.5% times the square root of

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
P times 1 minus P equals n and substituting n and evaluating this expression

5
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the square root of 0.55<i>0.45/100</i>1.96 is equal to 9.75%.
