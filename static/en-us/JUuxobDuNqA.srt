Well, there's two choices for you. Either the client could do it or

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:06,120
the server could do it. In the client situation, the client sends the votes

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,890
at the point which the user makes them. If it were the server doing it,

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,260
the server would have to periodically poll the clients,

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,040
to know if there were any votes that it needed to get. Seems to

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,500
me that in this situation, because the user interactions are intermittent,

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,710
that having the client initiate the interaction probably makes more sense.
