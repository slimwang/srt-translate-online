1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,200
Now, the magnitude of that Gaussian
noise we just added we said was

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,471
controlled by sigma.

3
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:07,510
Ran then generated random noise
with the unit variance and

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,240
we scaled it by this value of sigma.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,420
Now, we looked at it by adding
the noise to an image and

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,650
just looking at the resulting image.

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,910
We could have looked at the noise
just as because it's a function,

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,719
we can display it as anything else.

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,060
But before I do, a few of you should
be screaming out there because

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,010
if you know anything about the Gaussian
distribution or the normal distribution,

11
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,960
it's got a piece like this and
a piece like this.

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,340
It's got parts that are positive and
parts that are negative.

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,840
It's zero mean.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,750
So the noise is going to have values
that are positive and that're negative.

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,700
So how are we going to
display that as an image?

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,723
Well, remember what I said before,
it was only from computer science bad

17
00:00:47,723 --> 00:00:52,600
training that you think that images go
from 0 to 255, 0 black, 255 is white.

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,480
We can make whatever we
want be black and be white.

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,134
So for example, we can make anything
less than negative 20 black,

20
00:00:59,134 --> 00:01:03,229
anything more than positive 20 white and
nice grey scale in the middle, and

21
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,577
in fact,
what value do you think 0 will be?

22
00:01:05,577 --> 00:01:06,910
It would be grey.

23
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,300
So that's how I'm going to display
the noise images directly.

24
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,600
So here you can see the effects of
sigma on the Gaussian noise, and

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,713
I'm going to be clear,
this is the sigma of the noise.

26
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:22,440
Because in a lecture or two, we're
going to have sigma of a filter and

27
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,220
it's going to be a Gaussian filter and
big sigmas will make noise go away, here

28
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,510
big sigmas make noise show up and you'll
just have to learn to deal with that.

29
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,350
So here,
I'm showing you some simple examples of

30
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,530
noise images where we have
a different value of sigma.

31
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,775
Okay, and you can see in the top left,
it's a very small sigma and

32
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:46,736
it looks like almost a perfectly
uniform grey background.

33
00:01:46,736 --> 00:01:51,880
And as sigma goes up, goes 8, 32, 64,
okay, you can see if it looks more and

34
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,600
more textured, the noise gets bigger
which is just like you would expect.

35
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,730
What do you think
the underlying ranges here are?

36
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,307
See, I haven't really told you so
imagine if I had an image that

37
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:09,160
just went from 0 to 1, right,
so black was 0, white was 1.

38
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:15,090
If I had a sigma of 20 or a sigma of 8,
right, that noise would totally swamp

39
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,600
out the image, right, there a signal
of 0.2 or 0.02 might make more sense.

40
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,650
All right, so here I'm displaying it
as if I was thinking about let's say 0

41
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,560
being black, or let's say minus 128
being black and plus 127 being white.

42
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,420
So you have to worry about
the relative scale of the noise

43
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,280
to the overall range of the image.
