1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This differential equation would mean that T1 decays exponentially to zero.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're losing a certain fraction every hour. This does not make sense.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
With this differential equation, T2 would gain from T1.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The red process would be in place, but we would never lose anything--this is not true.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In the second differential equation, initially T2 is smaller than T1,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
meaning that this difference is negative.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The rate of change of T2 would initially at least be negative which doesn't make sense T2 has to grow.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The first one is correct. The percentage of 10%--0.1 per hour of T2 flowing into T1

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and there is minus 10% per hour of T1 flowing out of T1

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and in a similar fashion the lower one is true as 10% per hour of T1 flowing into T2 a plus sign

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
here and there is minus 10% per hour of T2 flowing out of T2 minus.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So actually what's of interest to us is only the difference of the temperatures. Footnote.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So we could have been using degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit all the way

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
because we're forming this difference and are not interested in the total amount

15
00:01:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of energy contained in each compartment.
