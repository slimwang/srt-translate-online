In Java, a variable can't just hold objects of any type, but one has to specify

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,540
the type that it can hold. In this parking space analogy, look at this variable

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:18,135
here. This particular one holds bicycles and we say that's the type of this

4
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:23,310
variable. Now, look at this variable here. There's the name. And in Java, we

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,100
write the type before the name. First the type, then the name. String is the

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,729
type, greeting is the name. String greeting.
