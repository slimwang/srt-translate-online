1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,390
Now we just looked at how to use the insert command

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,260
from the PyMongo client in order to get documents into our

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,990
MongoDB database. A better way to do this in my opinion,

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,570
is to output all of our documents as a Json file.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,960
And that's what I did here. So, instead of

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,630
our Python cleaning program, actually putting data into MongoDB directly.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,260
We simply separate the two concerns, the task of

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,830
cleaning the data from the task of getting it into

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,530
mongoDB. And the intermediary we use is a file

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,420
that has one Json document per line. Now we can

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,150
bulk import this data into mongoDB using the mongo import

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,140
system command. I'll show you a very common use for

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,270
mongo import here. See the instructor notes for

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,600
the link to the mongo import documentation. Okay, mongoimport

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,400
has a number of command-line parameters associated with

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,415
it, and we can see those by typing --help.

17
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:57,995
Okay, other way to get documentation on mongoimport.

18
00:00:57,995 --> 00:01:00,700
Okay, so let's use mongoimport to get our auto's

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,010
data into a collection. First, I'm going to

20
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,210
specify the database, and we'll continue using the examples

21
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,960
database that we've been using all along. And then I'm going

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,070
to specify the collection into which this data should be stored. In

23
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,530
this case I'm going to store it in another collection, myautos2. And then

24
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,880
finally, I need to specify the file that I actually want to

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,725
import. That file is in the same directory, and it's called

26
00:01:23,725 --> 00:01:27,600
autos.json. Now if I run this, we get an, a nice output

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,500
message telling us that we imported those same documents we saw before

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,390
when we were using the Insert command in order to get data

29
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,210
into MongoDB. So now we've looked at two different

30
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,900
ways to get data into MongoDB. And there are others.
