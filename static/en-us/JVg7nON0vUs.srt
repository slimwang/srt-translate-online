00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,990
In the previous exercise, the vertex shader was modified to change the surface

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,380
locations so that a part of a sphere was formed. However, the illumination

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,480
looks pretty bad. It doesn't look very curved. As we rotate around, there are

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,660
lighting computations going on. The shading changes but somethings not right.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,960
Why is the illumination incorrect? Is it that the vertex shader revserved the

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,230
triangles loops? The fragment shader is now wrong and must be modified. The

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,590
vertex shader did not modify the shading normals or the geometric normals have

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,373
been warped by the vertex shader.
