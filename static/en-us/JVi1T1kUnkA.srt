You can change Udacity logo on the page simply by selecting the element and

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,540
changing the source of the image tag.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,080
Here I've used a nested selection.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,630
So first, I select the a tag that's the link with class navbar-brand and .logo

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:23,780
so the a tag needs to have both navbar-brand and logo and within that selection.

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:29,440
So within the a tag, we then select whichever image tag is in there.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,759
Change the attribute of the source to what

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,670
here is a URL to the Zipfian Academy logo.

9
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,320
As you can see here but

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,800
it's a little bit hard given the background of the nav-bar.

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,660
The logo is now pointing to Zipfian logo.
