00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,830
As it is right now, we're actually giving you a pretty cool tool in the resume.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,330
If you want to make a map appear at the bottom, it's actually real easy.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,200
Let's scroll down and take a look at it.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,230
We can see this great Where I've Lived and Worked map.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,860
Here we can see place markers for all the places where James has worked.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,940
To add this to your resume, it's actually pretty simple.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,980
I'm going to open up dev tools again in the sources pane, and

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,333
I've added this line to my resume builder.js.

9
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:30,440
I've added mapdiv.appendgoogleMap.

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,710
Inside helperjs, we've got some functions set up that make it really easy for

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,120
you to add a map that automatically puts place markers where you've

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,730
lived and work.

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:40,999
Add this to your code and see what happens.

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,704
The functions in helperjs are using the JSONS created in resumebuilder.js.

15
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:50,100
It iterates through the locations, it rooms google searches on

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,060
all those locations, and then uses the results to put pins on the map.

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,800
It's pretty awesome and

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,060
there's actually going to be a quiz in the practice problem section after this

19
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,080
lecture, where you'll be able to break it apart to see how it works.

20
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,690
>> But beyond a Google Map, you have tons of options for

21
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,040
making your resume interesting and interactive.

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,590
For starters, try editing the resume's CSS to style it the way that you want.

23
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,610
If you're unfamiliar with CSS, check out our course on HTML and CSS.

24
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,030
It's in the instructor's notes.

25
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,240
>> Or you could even use a library like D3 to add a chart that

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,669
helps people visualize your skills.

27
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,050
I like that one.

28
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,320
It's worth poking around D3 to check out the really cool charts, graphs, and

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,740
visualizations you can easily add to your resume.

30
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,370
>> And while you're at it, check out the links in the Instructor's notes,

31
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,480
to other cool resumes we found online.

32
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,680
Get some inspiration and try customizing yours.
