1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Thrun] And the answer is both of them,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and the reason is X1 might be closer to C2 than C1,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
but the correspondence in EM is soft,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which means each data point always corresponds to all cluster centers.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It is just that this correspondence over here

6
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is much stronger than the correspondence over here.
