1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,410
Since we've been coding for

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,040
a while now, I wanted to pause to
check back in with Roman Nurik at our

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,064
Design Center in New York City
to talk a bit more about design.

4
00:00:08,064 --> 00:00:13,109
[SOUND] Roman, once again,
thanks for your time.

5
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:16,099
Do you think that every mobile app
developer should strive to become

6
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:16,679
a designer?

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,400
>> Well, I don't think it's
necessarily important for

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,330
every developer to become a designer,
and stop doing their engineering work.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,030
I do think, though,
that every developer,

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,070
every front end developer,
should have some sense of design.

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,210
And I also think that, really,
as a mobile developer,

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,110
you're already doing design work, right?

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,780
Whether you like it or
not, you are creating,

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,430
you're crafting the experience for
the end-user.

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,900
And so what I think is important is
just knowing that this is something that

16
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,260
you're participating in.

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,330
This is not something that
is being handed to you, and

18
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,330
you're just executing on.

19
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,170
Knowing that this is something you're
participating in, I think it's super

20
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,030
important for developers to
really kind of study up on it.

21
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,950
To get as good as possible at
observing the differences,

22
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,660
observing the little details and really
kind of caring about every little,

23
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,430
I hate saying every little pixel, but
every little decision here and there.

24
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,610
And so I think rather than saying every
developer should become a designer,

25
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,150
I think every developer should
really understand design.

26
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,650
Always understanding also that you're
going to be working in a team, and

27
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,955
kind of understanding what your
designers are good at and so forth.

28
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:31,200
So, yes.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,170
[LAUGH]
In short.

30
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,150
>> For me, that's super interesting.

31
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,940
And you can definitely see how we're
using material in our cross platform

32
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,350
experiences here at Google.

33
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,110
While being true, in many ways,
to the unique element of each platform.

34
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,320
Design has become so much more important
in building applications of all sorts.

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,080
And I think it's really important for
every engineer to at least be familiar

36
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,370
with the palliative options available
to them and to their designers.

37
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,300
To that end, Roman Nurik,
Nick Butcher, and James Williams,

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,860
are developing a terrific
course in material design,

39
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,650
that any front end engineer
should experience.
