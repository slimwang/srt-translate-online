00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,110
Okay, so here is our program design. I'm going

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,720
to start by opening a browser and playing a

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,430
song. So previously, I Googled to find out how

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,890
one would open a web browser in python. And I

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:17,680
discovered that there is this function called webbrowser.open. This

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,340
function takes in the link I want to open.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,810
I just placed a Youtube address in there. In

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,950
fact, this could have been any link you want. Alright.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,380
Let's save the program and run it. I'm going

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,470
to call it Breaktime dot Py. Py stands for

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,200
Python. To run it, I will click on run,

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,700
and then click on run module. Now my hypothesis is

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,840
that when we run this program it will open

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,330
the Youtube link. Let's see. Oh. It seems like

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,170
we have an error. Okay, it says there's an

16
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,450
error in your program, EOL, whatever that means, while scanning

17
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,210
the string literal. Okay? Oh, look Python is

18
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,840
pointing out the error. It seems like I missed

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,330
the closing quote, so I'm going to add that.

20
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,260
Let me save the program one more time and

21
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,978
run it. Now I believe it will work.

22
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:11,140
Hm, another error. You know, when I first learned

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,210
how to program, I felt so intimidated by these

24
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,940
errors. Look at them. They are red and in

25
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,080
your face, but to make the program work, we have

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,390
to somehow get past them. So, would you mind reading

27
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,550
the error and telling us what you think is the

28
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,770
problem with this code? Enter your responses in this box.
