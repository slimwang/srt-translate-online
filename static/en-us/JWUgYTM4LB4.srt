1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,650
Health care industry is huge, and

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,415
there are a lot of data
coming out of health care.

3
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:08,290
U.S. health care is
incredibly expensive.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:13,700
Overall spending is $3.8
trillion in U.S. per year.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,780
That's more than the value of
ten biggest companies plus ten

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:23,730
Beijing Olympics plus a Warren Buffet,
and a Bill Gates.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,690
But does it have to be that way?

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,230
There is massive waste in
health care unfortunately.

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:36,390
The estimated waste in U.S.
healthcare alone is $765 billion.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,550
That's equivalent to the NASA's
total budget for the past 50 years.

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,590
Not only the cost is an issue, but
also the quality of healthcare is poor.

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,662
There are 200 to 400 thousand
preventable deaths per year in the U.S.

13
00:00:52,662 --> 00:00:55,093
That's 1,000 people per day.

14
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:59,050
Four preventable deaths
occurred during this video.

15
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,350
If we classify the preventable deaths
against other causes of deaths,

16
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,270
it will be the number three causes
of deaths in the United States.

17
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,310
After only heart disease and cancer.

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,190
So, there are massive problems
presented in modern health care.

19
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,350
Including high costs,
high waste, and low quality.

20
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,200
How can big data help?

21
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,870
The hope is big data can lead
to better care and lower cost.
