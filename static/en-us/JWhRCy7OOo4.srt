Although what we just looked at is, looks like a programming language,

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,905
syntax, text and so on, if you use ACME, you'll likely to use it through

3
00:00:09,905 --> 00:00:15,040
its graphical editor, in which case, you can draw all of what's going on.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,510
Here is a screenshot from, the ACME studio tool.

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,260
It, it contains two rectangles which correspond to the components and

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,640
one circle which corresponds to the connector, and you can see that the two

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,450
components are both plugged into the connector and hence, can communicate with

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,250
each other. If you build your description using the graphical editor,

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,920
you can then generate the code we've just seen in the textual form.
