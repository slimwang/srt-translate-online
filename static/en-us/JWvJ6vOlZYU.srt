1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,120
Welcome back. We have good news and bad news.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,560
The bad news first is that this is the last

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,730
lesson in the course. The good news though this is

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,050
going to be the most awesome lesson in the course.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,940
>> So to recap what we've learned so far.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,400
>> In lesson one we talked about what

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,410
is UX and the difference between UI and UX.

8
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,510
>> In lesson two we talked the user centered

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,600
design process and got into personas and use cases.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,820
>> In lesson three, we talked about the mobile

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,800
user and talked about different mobile user constraints. Yeah and lesson four

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,430
we are going to talk about not about constraints but about the capabilities

13
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,020
that are unlocked by mobile and the amazing things that you can do

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,090
on Android to blow your users minds and create amazing five star applications.

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,990
>> So Nazmul, everybody wants to know.

16
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,600
>> How do we get closer to making five star apps. That's a good

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,760
question. First, we're going to understand the

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,890
amazing capabilities that Android platform has to offer.

19
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,540
Then, we're going to imagine how to use these capabilities

20
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,600
to create some really kick ass features for your apps

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,240
and through all this we're going to learn that context

22
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,030
is what helps us deliver five star applications to our users.

23
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,220
>> So, Nazmul what do you mean by context? So context

24
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,590
is all about a user and what they're doing in a

25
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,410
physical environment when they're interacting

26
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,400
with your application. Now, before we

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,540
get to the details of what context is made up of.

28
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,920
You're probably a web and desktop developer, so

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,100
let's talk about the difference between the Android

30
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,540
platform and web and desktop. There's some fundamental

31
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,520
similarities between web/desktop and mobile machines. I mean after

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,420
all, they actually collect data from input sources

33
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,280
they process that information and they produce output.

34
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,040
So what are some of the inputs do

35
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,250
you think that are similar between web/desk and Android?

36
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,660
>> Well they both have keyboards and you can enter information that way.

37
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,610
>> And they also

38
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,860
both have pointing devices.

39
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,780
>> And they both have a network connection. Yeah they're a

40
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,960
lot of similarity of input sources but the power of Android

41
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,450
truly lies in the input sources or sensors that are available

42
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,500
in Android that are simply not available on web and desktop.

43
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,493
>> Exactly. One simple example is GPS. So can you name all the other

44
00:02:01,493 --> 00:02:03,428
input sources that are available on Android

45
00:02:03,428 --> 00:02:05,322
that are not available on web and desktop?

46
00:02:05,322 --> 00:02:07,269
