Did you get the closed interval from negative 1 to 1? If so, you should be very

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:08,175
proud of yourself. I know I am. Let's see how we got that solution. Remember

3
00:00:08,186 --> 00:00:12,353
when you're working with a compound inequality that's written in this form, we

4
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:16,495
can perform operations as long as we do the same operation, to all three

5
00:00:16,507 --> 00:00:21,075
portions of the quation. The first thing I want to do is to get rid of this

6
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:26,090
fraction by multiplying through by the least common denominator, and the least

7
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:31,115
common denominator is 2. When I multiply 2 by negative 3, I get negative 6. When

8
00:00:31,127 --> 00:00:35,890
I multiply 2 by 5 x minus 1 over 2, I'm simply left with 5 x minus 1, and when I

9
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:40,386
multiply 2 times 2, I get 4. Next I'm going to add 1 to each part of the

10
00:00:40,398 --> 00:00:45,776
equation so I can isolate the variable in the middle. When I do that, negative 6

11
00:00:45,788 --> 00:00:50,937
plus 1 is negative 5, and 4 plus 1 is positive 5. Now I can divide through by 5.

12
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,073
Negative 5 divided by 5 is negative 1, less than or equal to x, less than or

13
00:00:56,085 --> 00:01:00,922
equal to 5 over 5 is positive 1. Let's draw that on the number line. This

14
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:06,027
portion of the inequality says that negative 1 is less than or equal to x, which

15
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:10,894
is the same as x is greater than or equal to negative 1. So, that means we're

16
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:13,521
going to be going in that direction.

17
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:18,436
This portion of the equation says x is less than or equal to positive 1, so we

18
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:23,444
use a square bracket and the answer's going here. So we have the interval from

19
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,092
negative 1 to 1 using the square brackets.
