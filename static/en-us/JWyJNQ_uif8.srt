A common misperception of
Google Analytics is that it's

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,340
a web-only solution.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,380
This is not the case.

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,320
We've made huge strides in the last
year to make it very mobile friendly.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,699
In fact, you'll start to see stats that
are very specific to mobile data within

6
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:14,135
the in the user interface.

7
00:00:14,135 --> 00:00:17,025
So I think right now the big thing
is that because Google analytics

8
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:18,765
has always been known as a web tool.

9
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:21,075
People don't really think to use it for
mobile apps.

10
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:24,025
But there's a whole section of
learning on our website today.

11
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:25,365
To learn more about
how we can help them.
