00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:03,969
I'd like to take a second to talk about a pretty important concept in Math in

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:08,328
general, especially when we're talking about graphing. And that is symmetry. We

3
00:00:08,328 --> 00:00:12,232
talked about this to a certain extent when we were dealing with quadratic

4
00:00:12,232 --> 00:00:16,482
functions, like y equals x squared. We said that if you have a parabola like

5
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:21,097
this one, we know that we can draw a line that goes straight through its vertex,

6
00:00:21,097 --> 00:00:25,570
such that, if you folded the problem in half along this line then it would map

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,530
directly onto itself. In other words, at any point along this middle line, this

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,192
axis of symmetry, the points on the parabola directly to the left or right of

9
00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:39,844
it, are equally distant from the axis. So if I'm at this position for example,

10
00:00:39,844 --> 00:00:44,329
this y value, then the distance in the extraction from here to here, is the same

11
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:48,600
in terms of absolute value, as the distance from here to here. Now it seems

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,352
looking at these other even functions, like a similar kind of symmetry applies

13
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:58,280
to them. One question is, do odd functions have symmetry as well? And, in both

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,324
cases, how do we mathematically express that symmetry. Now, I'm about to give

15
00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:06,540
you a kind of complex quiz that's going to require a fair amount of critical

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,718
thinking and some new materials. So, this is going to definitely be a major

17
00:01:10,718 --> 00:01:15,193
challenge problem. So, if we know that a point, that we are going to call x

18
00:01:15,193 --> 00:01:20,013
comma y, is on a given graph. What if we find that the point negative x comma y

19
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:24,282
is also on that graph? What does that say about this graph? Does that mean that

20
00:01:24,282 --> 00:01:28,430
is represent an even function, or an odd function, or neither of these? Think

21
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:33,514
about which of the graphs either on this plane or this plane, this property

22
00:01:33,514 --> 00:01:37,380
applies to. And you can even test it out with real points.
