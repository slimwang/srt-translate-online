[Norvig] Here's one way to do it.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What I've done is I only changed this line, and instead of just returning r

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
for r, s in hand, I've taken r and used it as a lookup into this value.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So I'm saying when r is the letter 2, I look up into this string and say

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
what index is 2 in there and where is it?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You start counting at 0, so it's 0, 1, 2.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So the character 2 would map to the number 2,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the character T would map to the number 10, J to 11,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Q to 12, K to 13, and A to 14.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So that gives me a correct mapping from characters to index numbers,

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and they'll all come out right. I could have done it other ways.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I could have had a dictionary lookup, I could have had a long set of if-then-else statements,

13
00:00:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but this seemed the simplest way to do it.
