1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,390
Ladies and gentleman, I am Agent B.of MIB with an important announcement.

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,910
Thousands of alien bugs have been invading our code.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,766
The invasion threatens our flight navigation systems.

4
00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:17,347
Our financial infrastructure and our ability to play Candy Crush.

5
00:00:17,347 --> 00:00:27,347
[MUSIC]

6
00:00:30,267 --> 00:00:34,180
To fight back, MIB has invented a secret weapon.

7
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,483
The code review and

8
00:00:35,483 --> 00:00:41,034
assembled a crack team of reviewers gather in our headquarters in New York City.

9
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:46,368
[NOISE] Gentlemen, would you now introduce

10
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:52,302
yourself to the public, first our moderator.

11
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:56,390
>> Hello, I am Moderator, sometimes also called the controller.

12
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,898
My name is 3.8.

13
00:00:57,898 --> 00:00:59,744
I'm a professor in computer science, and

14
00:00:59,744 --> 00:01:02,786
they call me 3.8 because it took me 3.8 billion years to evolve.

15
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:06,712
>> Next, our Reader.

16
00:01:06,712 --> 00:01:09,490
>> Hi, I'm the Reader, Dr. Bug.

17
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,700
They call me Dr. Bug because I smash bugs.

18
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,920
>> Here's our recorder.

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,610
>> Hi, I'm Crazy Bob.

20
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,130
They call me Crazy Bob because I'm crazy about Ada.

21
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,700
I'm the tech lead on our avionics project.

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,970
We delivered 1.4 million lines of safety-critical Ada code.

23
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,310
>> Next we have Inspector Fra Elbertus.

24
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,280
>> Hi, I'm Fra Elbertus.

25
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,490
I'm the friar of doom.

26
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,880
I was the originator of the sticky net virus when I consulted for

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,920
one of those three letter government agencies.

28
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,380
You haven't heard of sticky net because it was so

29
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,880
evil, they had to redo it and call it Stuxnet.

30
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,390
>> And our other inspector, Byte.Me.

31
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,960
>> Hi everyone my name's Byte.Me.

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,640
I used to have a back story, but I pseudo RN'd it years ago.

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,200
I like coffee, code and Reddit.

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,540
That's about it.

35
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,980
>> Finally, I will also be an inspector.

36
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,319
Now ladies and gentlemen, let me show you the first invasion site.

37
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,169
A key piece of software infrastructure called BlankCount.java.

38
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:18,170
