00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,810
Let's look at how to
transpose data in Alteryx.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,469
When we look at the data,

3
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:09,740
we can see that sales are shown
in six different fields by month.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,780
We're going to take these six fields,
and put them all into one sales field.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,660
To do this, we drag in the transpose
tool from the transform category.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,580
Notice how the tool image itself
is showing you the before and

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,400
after of the data.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,013
We're going to go from wide to long.

9
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:33,790
The key field which is the field
that is not going to be transposed,

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,422
is the product field.

11
00:00:35,422 --> 00:00:39,340
While all the rest of the fields
remain checked in the data fields.

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,820
When we run the workflow, we can see
that 3 records turn into 18 records.

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,260
There were three records initially.

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,260
With six fields of data.

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:56,550
So when we transpose the data
this becomes 18 records of data.

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,320
Each initial record is now
represented by six records.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,060
One for each month.

18
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,720
So when we transpose the data,
it creates two fields.

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,820
One is name or the name of
the field the data came from.

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,370
And value, which is the sales value.

21
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:18,630
We can use the select tool to change
the field called value to sales.

22
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,420
And then the field called name to date.
