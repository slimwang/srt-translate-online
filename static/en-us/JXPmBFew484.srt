1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,710
For the theoretical component of this course there's no required textbook.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,680
It is recommended, however, that you have access to some solid operating system

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,900
textbook as an additional reference.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,852
There are a number of options out there from a variety of authors.

5
00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:16,274
And there are also many books that are available online,

6
00:00:16,274 --> 00:00:18,840
including with completely free content.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,020
My personal favorites are the Silberschatz operating systems books,

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,430
often called the dinosaur books because of the dinosaur on the cover.

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,410
There is one that includes more detail, Operating System Concepts, and

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,270
then an abbreviated one, Operating System Concepts Essentials.

11
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,990
I also like the Tanenbaum textbook called Modern Operating Systems.

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,480
And to this one, I have personally contributed to the Linux case study chapter.

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,450
If you look online,

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,660
each of these books has a number of available online resources.

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,450
There's some slides for the chapters.

16
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,740
There's some free available text online.

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,620
And there are also affordable Kindle editions that are for rent even.

18
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,740
And there is also a lot of material that's freely available online.

19
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:03,291
There's one recent title prepared by Andrea and Remzi Arpaci-Disseai.

20
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:06,472
It's called Operating Systems Three Easy Pieces.

21
00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:10,174
This is a good book and its content matched fairly well with the content that

22
00:01:10,174 --> 00:01:12,140
we'll cover in this course.

23
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,480
For certain lectures, I will also provide you with specific references from

24
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,840
which the lecture content is drawn.

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,540
Mostly these will be research papers, and some of them can be quite old.

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,010
But they're still quite seminal works in computer science.

27
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,940
Less often there will be some tutorials, manuals on specific OS technologies, or

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,810
even technology surveys.

29
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,050
In any case, all of these resources will be linked to in the Instructor Notes or

30
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,150
in the Course Wiki online.

31
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,980
Finally, regarding the programming aspect of this course,

32
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,530
I said that you will be required to program in C in a Linux environment and

33
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,110
that your programming assignments will require multi threaded programming.

34
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,610
To help with these topics there are a number of resources online for

35
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,070
C programming, for threading libraries such as PThreads.

36
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,670
And we'll make sure to provide links to some such content with your

37
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,555
programming assignment
