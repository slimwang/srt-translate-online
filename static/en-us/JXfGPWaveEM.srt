1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,040
Oh my god Mark,
I have the best idea for an app!

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,570
It's going to totally change the world.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,860
>> Oh, yeah?

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,320
>> Yeah, it will totally revolutionize
how left handed people meet each other.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,530
>> Really?

6
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,020
>> It's so simple Mark.

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,170
You'll be shown pictures
of other lefties near you,

8
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,160
and you'll swipe them to the right if
you don't think they're interesting, and

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,560
you'll swipe them to the left If
they're a lefty you would like to meet.

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,576
>> Brilliant, I'm sure.

11
00:00:22,576 --> 00:00:25,970
>> Ugh, you wouldn't understand.

12
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,185
Look at you,
standing there in your righty privilege.

13
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:32,509
>> Mm-hm.

14
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:33,606
>> Well I just wanted to thank you for

15
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:35,420
teaching me everything there
is to know about Gradle.

16
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,530
I'm going to be using the Gradle Java
plugin to build my Android app.

17
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,810
I just thought you'd be proud.

18
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,990
>> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,780
We barely scratched
the surface of Gradle.

20
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,490
There's a lot more to building
an Android app than just compiling some

21
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,620
Java code.

22
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,180
>> No,
I'm pretty sure I know everything.

23
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,730
I'm changing the world, remember?

24
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:50,890
>> I know, I know.

25
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,290
But, let's take a look at how
the Android build process works, first.

26
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,970
>> I promise we'll change
the world tomorrow.

27
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,470
>> Fine.
