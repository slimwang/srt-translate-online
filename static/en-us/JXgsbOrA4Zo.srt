00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,692
In lots of applications, you need to read many inputs. Here, when you look at

2
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:08,477
these adorable kittens, of course, you want to pet them all. But if you're a

3
00:00:08,477 --> 00:00:11,662
vet, you might also need to know their weight, their average weight, which

4
00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:16,175
one's the largest, which one's the smallest, and so on. So, a program that

5
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:20,982
processes data like that needs to read in all of that information. It needs to

6
00:00:20,982 --> 00:00:25,440
specifically, in this case, read in the weight of every kitten. So, we might

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,779
want to prompt to enter the first weight, the user enters first kitten weighs

8
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:33,596
100 grams. We get the prompt for the second weight, the user enters, prompt for

9
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:38,352
the third weight and so on. Well, when do we stop? Maybe we could have asked

10
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:42,347
the user how many values are you going to enter? Now, that's a little clumsy,

11
00:00:42,347 --> 00:00:45,976
particularly when there's lots of values. There's a common solution to this

12
00:00:45,976 --> 00:00:51,837
problem. And that is to ask the user to enter some input, that definitely can't

13
00:00:51,837 --> 00:00:58,180
be the right value. In this case here, we might ask the user to enter 0,

14
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:06,995
because no kitten can weigh 0 grams. Such a value is called a sentinel value.
