1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,969
Now that we formally recognize that this is a quadratic equation, it would be

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:08,810
really great if we could get it in the form x minus a times x minus b, so

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:13,470
we could easily see what values of x satisfy this equation. This is going to

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,085
be way easier to solve if we have two linear factors multiplied together.

5
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:21,880
Than if we have to deal with this messy squared term right here. So,

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,300
let's take a second and just look at this product for a moment. Now, actually to

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,510
make your life a little bit easier, I changed those minus signs to plus signs.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,710
So we now have the expression x plus a, times x plus b. Now,

9
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:41,260
as a starting point for working with this expression x plus a times x plus b.

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,920
I'd like you to try distributing the multiplication here out, and

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,180
writing the answer that you get as a polynomial in standard form.
