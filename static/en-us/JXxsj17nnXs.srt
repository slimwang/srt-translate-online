00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
When reasoning about HTML, it's critical

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
that we understand quoted strings.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
They come up in almost every anchor tag,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and anchor tags are the essence of hypertext.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
They're the interlinks between documents, so we really need those.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
They rely on quoted strings.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That means we're going to need to understand quoted strings.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It is convenient then that we are amazing at quoted strings.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You have plenty of practice with them from the previous unit.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Once again, it's time for a quiz.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Suppose that the strings we care about start with a double quote,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
end with a double quote, and in the middle

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
they can contain any number of characters except double quotes.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'd like you to write a definition for the Python function t_string

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and submit it via the interpreter.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And just to make this a bit clearer, we should definitely accept quoted strings like

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
cuneiform or sumerian writing.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But we should not accept 30th century BCE

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
because it doesn't start and end with quotes,

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and we should not accept this string which has an escaped double quote.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We may want to get to that later, but for now, don't worry about escaped double quotes.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Go to it. Submit via the interpreter.
