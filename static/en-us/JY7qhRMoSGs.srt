00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,750
Here's the correct answer. Excellent work if you got it. When we start to

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,154
factor, we want to look for a greatest common factor first. The three terms

3
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:12,575
don't share an x, so I can't factor an x out. The three terms also don't share

4
00:00:12,575 --> 00:00:16,615
y, since this first term doesn't have one. And when we look at the coefficients,

5
00:00:16,615 --> 00:00:20,975
the greatest common factor is just one. This trinomial is a perfect square

6
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:27,155
trinomial pattern. The a is to x and the b is 5y. So we can factor our trinomial

7
00:00:27,155 --> 00:00:31,716
using a minus b squared. 2x minus 5y squared.
