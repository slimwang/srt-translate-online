1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,570
So you may have heard the term memory
when we're referring to computers.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,780
Well, what does this term really mean?

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,660
Now your phone can be thought of as
basically a miniature mobile computer.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,620
And computers have two kinds of storage,
temporary storage and permanent storage.

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,250
So the difference between temporary and
permanent storage can be thought of

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,410
similarly to short-term memory and
long-term memories that humans have.

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,180
Now in the temporary memory example,
say you're going to a restaurant and

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,790
you look up the restaurant's address
as you're driving along the street.

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,310
So you'll probably
remember this address for

10
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,760
as long as it took you to
get to the restaurant.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,840
Then after a few hours when
you have left the restaurant,

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,370
you have completely
forgotten the address.

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,400
Now on the other hand
with permanent memory,

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,470
say you remember something
like your home address.

15
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,720
And you will probably remember that for
years and years and years.

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,340
So temporary storage is
similar to short-term memory.

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,460
And that means information that's
important for the task at hand but

18
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,880
then quickly forgotten when
it's no longer needed.

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,060
Whereas permanent storage is
similar to long-term memory.

20
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,090
So that means information that sticks
around in your brain for years and

21
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,950
years, such as the name
of your father or

22
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,010
mother or
even the lyrics to your favorite song.

23
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,170
So if we look at each of these
in more detail, on a computer,

24
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,160
temporary storage is short-term storage.

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,610
Used for things such as calculations and
displaying things onto the screen.

26
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,496
So it's quick and easy to access,
but the downside of this,

27
00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:31,940
is that the information doesn't stick
around forever, it's short-term use.

28
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,880
So when we refer to a computer memory,

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,160
we're referring to this
type of temporary storage.

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,350
So if you've ever heard the acronym RAM,
such as someone saying, well,

31
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,730
my computer has 4 gigs of RAM, well,

32
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,340
they're referring to
the temporary computer memory.

33
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,930
RAM stands for random access memory.

34
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,980
Permanent storage comes in
the form of your hard disks, or

35
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,890
any of those flash drives you
have lying around the house.

36
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,100
So these permanent storage locations
are the places you want to save off

37
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,760
all the files that you want around for
a long time.

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,870
Now note that this type of storage can
be more time consuming to save off and

39
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,970
access.

40
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:11,650
So is this important as to why temporary
storage can be useful in some cases.

41
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,170
For the purpose of this lesson,
we'll be exploring permanent storage.

42
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,029
And if you'd like to learn more about
either kinds of these storage options, I
