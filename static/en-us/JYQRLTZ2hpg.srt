Statecharts add quite a few features. We're going to be looking at

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,180
the first two because they're the ones that give the greatest benefit. But

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,530
I'll mention also some of the others, okay?

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:18,310
In particular number one thing is statecharts offer nesting or depth, okay?

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:23,120
That is, a particular state in a statechart can be its own state machine.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,860
And you can zoom in that way. Secondly, they offer concurrency. Imagine

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:34,355
that you have two things going on, each of which can have a number of states.

8
00:00:34,355 --> 00:00:38,010
Recall from state transition diagrams that in order to model that we have to

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,140
multiply the number of states. Statecharts allow you to treat those separately,

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,250
okay? Therefore, only getting an additive number of states rather than

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,420
a multiplicative number of states. Of course once you've done that,

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,790
that is separated the concurrent machines into two parts, you still have to

13
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,185
synchronize them. That is, they still have to cooperate somehow, and

14
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:03,200
statecharts offers a way of doing that called broadcast events.

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,170
We'll look at that. And of course you could also use data conditions which

16
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:14,220
are globally available to both machines. We'll look at entry exit actions,

17
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,010
we'll look at event parameters, we'll look at history, and

18
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,790
of course the default states that we've already seen the icons for.
