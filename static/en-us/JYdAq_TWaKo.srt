Alice is medium happy right now and our goal is, of course, to make her more happy here.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:12,450
Let's find out if we can find some good rules for pre-processing a graph

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,590
for which we want to solve vertex cover, and the way we're going to do this is--

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:22,150
I am going to give you a couple of options of potential ideas for pre-processing.

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,290
So if there is a vertex with just one neighbor--what I mean by this is there's a vertex like this

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,710
it's connected to another vertex and that vertex is possibly connected to more vertices,

7
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,180
but this one here is only connected to this one.

8
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,690
Should we then, as a pre-processing rule, automatically take this vertex here

9
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:44,900
into the vertex cover or should we automatically take this vertex here into the vertex cover,

10
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:50,060
and as a third case, if we have a vertex that has just two neighbors--so something like this--

11
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,030
should we then have the pre-processing put these two vertices here into the vertex cover,

12
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,270
which of course would also mean that you do not need to have this one in here.

13
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:03,290
Please check all of the rules here that are correct--meaning that as required,

14
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,520
they do not affect the solution that we're going to find in the end.

15
00:01:06,520 --> 99:59:59,999
Having applied this rule, we can still find the smallest possible vertex cover for the whole graph.
