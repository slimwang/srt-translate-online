1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,510
The answer actually is true,
because remember we have write up root.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,050
You can write at your or higher level.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,264
So unclassified user is down here,
classified secret,

4
00:00:12,264 --> 00:00:15,268
top secret, you can write at any level.

5
00:00:15,268 --> 00:00:19,050
Write up rule is the star
property that we have.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,600
The answer here is true.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,090
Again, if you think something is not
right here, think about the BLP models,

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,070
focus is on confidentiality or
disclosure of information.

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,860
An unclassified user has no
sensitive information and

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,250
gets written at whatever level.

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,030
They may want to choose to call
it top secret perhaps, but

12
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,980
that is not going to disclose
any sensitive information

13
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,486
to somebody who should
not have access to it.

14
00:00:45,486 --> 00:00:49,450
So, the write up rule is
the reason why the answer to

15
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,120
this quiz question is true.
