00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,370
Here's nearly the same exact problem except this time we have a less than

2
00:00:04,382 --> 00:00:08,857
symbol. I'm going to solve this inequality just like before. First, 2x plus 1

3
00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:13,486
can be less than 7 here or 2x plus 1 could be greater than negative 7 here. But

4
00:00:13,498 --> 00:00:17,981
I don't have to solve these separately. I know 2x plus 1 is less than 7, but

5
00:00:17,993 --> 00:00:23,065
greater than negative 7. So it's in between these 2 numbers. Let's just write 1

6
00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:28,059
inequality and solve it. First I can subtract 1 from all 3 parts. This gives me

7
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:32,747
negative 8 is less than 2 x is less than 6. Now I just divide every part by 2.

8
00:00:32,856 --> 00:00:37,767
So x is greater than negative 4 but less than 3. It's between these values. We

9
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:42,428
can see we get the numbers between negative 4 and 3. Using parentheses we can

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,258
include these point because we don't have an equal to by here. This would be the

11
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,345
answer in interval notation. In the last problem we had a greater than symbol

12
00:00:50,357 --> 00:00:54,225
and we got the outside portions of the number line. For the less than symbol, we

13
00:00:54,237 --> 00:00:58,337
get an intersection, the part in between. I hope this helps with your problem

14
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:58,768
solving.
