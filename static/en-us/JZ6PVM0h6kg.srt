1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,880
Finally, a word of warning or clarification at least.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,500
We just talked about sigma as being the width of a Gaussian,

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,170
where that was the variance of the, of the smoo, smoothing of the blurring.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:17,150
Last time we talked about sigma or sigma squared as the variance of

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,420
a noise function, how much noise was being added.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,005
So in one case, where we share might the filter, the sigma is in space, okay?

7
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:30,580
Where as in the noise case it's in an intensity or itâ€™s in the value.

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,600
The bigger the noise signal is, the more noise you added,

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,060
the bigger the blurring filter sigma, the more you're going to blur.

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,039
So, you have to be an in a reasonable called sigma as they're both

11
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,460
using a normal distribution.

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,600
But one is over a space, and one is over intensity.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
We can show those two sigmas here, and by the way,

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,778
here I'm using I'm using images that go from zero to one.

15
00:00:50,778 --> 00:00:54,740
Partially because that I know how sigma varies with respect to the range of

16
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,520
the image, and

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,122
partially because the slides that I stole off the Internet did this.

18
00:00:58,122 --> 00:00:59,150
All right?

19
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,910
So in the top row, there's no smoothing going on,

20
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,330
so we have a sigma of 0.2 in the noise.

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,545
That's a lot of noise if the range is only going from 0 to 1 or,

22
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:12,728
or let's say minus 0.5 to 0.5.

23
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:15,840
A sigma 0.1 is less noise.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,020
A sigma 0.05 is less noise yet.

25
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,885
But then we can smooth it, all right, with a Gaussian.

26
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:25,660
Right, this is the smoothing, with the Gaussian kernel.

27
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,440
And the more we smooth, the blurrier these things get.

28
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,410
And so, for the same amount of smoothing, the thing with the smaller amount of

29
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,480
noise, with the same amount of smoothing becomes even smoother, right?

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,200
So this image here is even smoother than that image there.

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,850
Okay?

32
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,030
But this is showing you those two sigmas, the two Gaussians.

33
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,800
Almost always it'll be clear from context, but

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,550
since I've had situations where students say,

35
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:54,010
wait a minute, I thought the bigger signal was, the more noise we got.

36
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,640
Now you're telling me the more sigma is, the more blurring is,

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,160
the less noise we have, and I say yep, two sigmas.
