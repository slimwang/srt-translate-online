1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,320
You've now gotten everything you need to
get started with building Android apps

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,630
that use Google Services.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:12,070
The API's that you've installed, give
you access to all of this functionality.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,950
And they give it to you
in a consistent way.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,240
Remember that Google API client that
you saw for accessing your location?

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,650
It's the same object, and very similar
code to what you'd use to access Google+

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,810
or Maps or Wallet or Drive.

8
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,020
You can learn these in
any order you like.

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,000
But the most important thing is
to get started and to get coding.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,470
So, you'll see just how easily you
can harness all this goodness.

11
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,400
You should go and
take the location module first,

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,250
because many of the concepts you'll
need for the others are covered there.

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:45,750
Let's go.
