00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,480
Now let's discuss the internet
key exchange protocol.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,210
When A and B require IPsec for
traffic between them for the first time.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,470
We do not yet have an SA.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,390
In other words, they have not yet
agreed upon the security parameters.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,970
Such as inclusion and
authentication algorithms and keys.

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,180
They need to negotiate these
parameters and store them in an SA.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,430
The Internet Key Exchange Protocol
is for this purpose.

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,690
The protocol works in two phases.

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,870
The first is to establish an IKE SA.

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,270
Because the negotiation of an SA
should itself be protected.

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:42,460
Then this SA is used to protect
the negotiations of multiple IPSec SAs.

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,830
The ISA is bi-directional.

13
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:50,130
That is, it protects the SA
negotiation traffic from both sides.
