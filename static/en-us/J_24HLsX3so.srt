1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,630
Let's talk for a moment about this metric of time between selections.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,100
Suppose that an Airhead is selected.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,440
Followed by a Starburst.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,790
Followed by two Hershey's.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,770
Followed by an Airhead again.

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:17,330
Let's define the number of candies that come between two Airhead selections as

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,300
the interselection time between Airheads.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,133
So if someone were to choose an Airhead here,

9
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:26,797
there would be zero turns in between Airhead selections.

10
00:00:26,797 --> 00:00:31,273
If someone were to choose an Airhead here, there would be one turn,

11
00:00:31,273 --> 00:00:32,774
two turns, and so on.

12
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:36,143
Until here, where someone actually chose an Airhead again.

13
00:00:36,143 --> 00:00:40,360
We have an interselection time of 4 turns between Airhead selections.

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,210
And just to reiterate, the interselection time for

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:48,070
a candy c is the number of turns between selections of that candy c.
