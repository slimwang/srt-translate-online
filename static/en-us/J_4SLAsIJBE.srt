00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,730
First, each app runs in a sandbox and
has its own home directory for

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:05,930
its files.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:06,810
This is true.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,940
Second, all iOS apps must be
reviewed and approved by Apple.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,920
This is true.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,290
Third, iOS apps can be
self-signed by app developers.

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,590
This is false.

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,306
Self signing means that the app
developers can issue its own

9
00:00:22,306 --> 00:00:27,420
certificate, and use the public key in
a certificate to sign its own apps, and

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,600
this is clearly false.
