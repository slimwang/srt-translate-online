1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,719
Okay, we have broken submissions. We can no longer submit

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,110
to ASCII Chan. I submit something, but we're only seeing

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,110
the cached page. So, so here's what happened. What we

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,330
did is, we made a request to ASCII Chan, who

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,390
made a query to the database, which came back with

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,650
a response. And then ASCII Chan Store that result of

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,930
that query in a cache. So now I've got all

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,320
of our artwork in our cache, and we use the

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,580
data in that cache to send the result back to

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,930
the user. Now when we submitted a new piece of art

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,320
to ASCII Chan, we wrote that art to the database, and

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,920
then we redirected the user back to the front page. The

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,630
user then requests to the front page again. At which

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:43,680
point ASCIIchan said, well, the data's already in the cache. I

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,620
don't need to check the database. And, return the value from

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,550
the cache again, straight to the user, without the new value.

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,910
This is a problem. It means now, submissions are still

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,790
working. They're going to the database. But because of the new

19
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,510
cache that we added. All of our requests are bouncing

20
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,920
off the cache and the cache isn't getting updated which is

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,820
resulting in it appearing as though submissions are broken which

22
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,030
brings us to our next quiz. How can we fix our

23
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,520
stale cache problem and stale cache of course refers to

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,670
the fact that our cache is stale. We submitted new content

25
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,680
to our database and our cache is now out

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,900
of date. That's referred to as having A stale cache.

27
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,710
Should we improve our cache to automatically expire things after

28
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,520
some time? After we submit, should we just clear the

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,390
cache? Or after we submit, should we update the

30
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,730
cache? Or don't cache at all? That's not going to work.

31
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,130
And we should find a different solution. There are multiple

32
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,200
good answers in here. Check all of them that apply.
