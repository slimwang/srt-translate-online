00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,360
Now that you've jogged your memory a bit about these three types of models,

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,230
let's talk about some specific examples that fit each of them. We're going to

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:13,450
look at a pretty wide variety of topics. Population growth, carbon dating, and

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,250
sound. Now earlier on in the course, we did talk about population growth, but

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,744
we did this with pandas. Now we're going to do it with humans. Now there's

6
00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:26,080
pretty great data out there about how many people there are in the world. And

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,170
we're going to check this out all the way from 1800 up through 2011. Let's take

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,410
a look at some numbers. So here's a chart showing how the world population has

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:42,078
changed in those 200 plus years. In 1800 there were only 1 billion people. And

10
00:00:42,078 --> 00:00:46,680
by 2011 there were 7 billion. Let's take a look at what this looks like on a

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,440
graph. Looking at how this data is plotted, what kind of model do you think

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,320
that this fits best? Does this look like exponential growth? Does it look like

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,630
exponential decay? Or does it look like logarithmic growth?
