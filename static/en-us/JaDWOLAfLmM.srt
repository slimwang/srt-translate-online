00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,870
And to wrap up our discussion
about memory management,

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,150
let's take a quiz about checkpointing.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,180
Which one of these endings correctly
completes the following statement?

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,600
The more frequently you checkpoint,
the more state you will checkpoint,

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,680
the higher the overheads of
the checkpointing process,

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,090
the faster you will be able to recover
from a fault, or all of the above.
