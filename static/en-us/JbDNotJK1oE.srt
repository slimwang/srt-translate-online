00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,180
The connection between production systems and

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,510
human cognition is both powerful and straightforward. In fact,

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,590
production systems, right from the beginning were proposed as models of

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,880
human cognition. We can look at it from several perspectives. First,

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,540
the working memory in production system has a counterpart in human cognition in

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,560
the form of short-term memory. Short-term memory and human cognition,

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,900
at least for the verbal part, has a capacity for approximately seven plus or

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,540
minus two elements. Working memory and production systems plays a similar role.

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,245
Second, people have connected studies which they have given the same problems,

10
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:47,060
both to humans and to cognitive architectures [INAUDIBLE]. These problems

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,700
typically are from closed worlds like arithmetic or algebra. At a consult,

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,600
there are strong similarities between the behavior of programs like SOAR and

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,800
the behavior of humans when they address problems in arithmetic and algebra.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,980
This, however, does not mean that we already have a very good complete model of

15
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:12,030
human cognition. This is just the beginning. Humans engage in a very large

16
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,160
number of problems, not just arithmetic or algebra problems in closed worlds.

17
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,290
So there still remain a large number of questions open about how do you build

18
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:26,370
a cognitive architecture that can capture human cognition at large in the open?
