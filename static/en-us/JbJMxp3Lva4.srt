00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,756
Here are the answers.

2
00:00:01,756 --> 00:00:07,437
Breadth-first search,
as the name implies,

3
00:00:07,437 --> 00:00:14,970
expands nodes in this order,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,216
So it's going across a stripe at a time,
breadth first.

5
00:00:19,216 --> 00:00:20,998
Is it optimal?

6
00:00:20,998 --> 00:00:25,359
Well, it's always expanding
the shortest paths first.

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,379
And so wherever the goal is hiding,

8
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:32,817
it's going to find it by
examining no longer paths.

9
00:00:32,817 --> 00:00:33,934
So in fact, it is optimal.

10
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:35,347
Cheapest-first.

11
00:00:35,347 --> 00:00:40,027
First we expand the path of length 0,

12
00:00:40,027 --> 00:00:45,000
then the path of length 2, now there's

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,823
a path of length 4, path of length 5,

14
00:00:49,823 --> 00:00:54,647
path of length 6, a path of length 7,

15
00:00:54,648 --> 00:00:58,940
and finally, a path of length 8.

16
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:04,078
And as we've seen, it's guaranteed
to find the cheapest path of all

17
00:01:04,078 --> 00:01:09,019
assuming that all the individual
step costs are non-negative.

18
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:11,891
Depth-first search tries to
go as deep as it can first.

19
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:18,313
So it goes 1, 2, 3, then backs up,

20
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:23,980
4, then backs up, 5, 6, 7.

21
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,044
And you can see that it doesn't
necessarily find the shortest path of

22
00:01:28,043 --> 00:01:28,402
all.

23
00:01:28,402 --> 00:01:32,897
Let's say that there were goals
in position 5 and in position 3,

24
00:01:32,897 --> 00:01:37,715
it would find the longer path to
position 3 and find the goal there, and

25
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:41,990
would not find the goal in position
five, so it is not optimal.

26
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,019
