If I look at my Twitterizer Tester, I now have a test for reversing, how did I

2
00:00:03,807 --> 00:00:09,414
ever program without loops? Inside the twitterizer class, I have to implement

3
00:00:09,414 --> 00:00:13,906
the reverse method. I want to look at every letter in the string post, but I

4
00:00:13,906 --> 00:00:18,822
want to start from the end, and work my way backwards. As I did last time, I'll

5
00:00:18,822 --> 00:00:21,702
start with an empty string backwards, that I'm going to add letters to, as I

6
00:00:21,702 --> 00:00:28,350
see new letters. But this time I'll start I at the last letter in post. And go

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:34,980
as long as i is not less than 0. I mean, as long as i, is not less than 0.

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,638
Decrimenting i by 1 each time. Inside the loop, I want to record every single

9
00:00:40,638 --> 00:00:45,610
letter I see into backwards, and then I want to return backwards. When I run

10
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,749
the program, it didn't break the first one, and now reverse works, as well.
