1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
A more tricky question--what do you think for this coin flip is the variance of the outcome?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's the question you never really asked, and it's okay to get it wrong or punt on it,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
but perhaps you can give it a try.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The math is very similar to the math that I provided here.
