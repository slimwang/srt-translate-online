00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,689
For this problem, you can pick any value of x that lies between 1 and 2.

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:08,710
So I'm just going to show you an example of how you could have done this.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,610
I'll pick the value 1.5, since that's right in the middle.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,730
Now if I find the value of the function at x equals 1.5.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:22,190
I'm actually finding f of 1.5, so I'll write that in here.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:27,730
And if we plug 1.5 into our function for x, we end up with negative 1.3125.

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,080
Now we know that between x equals 1 and x equals 2,

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,410
our function goes from being negative to being positive. Since f of 1.5 is

9
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,390
negative, we know that this is now the new narrower lower bound of our interval.

10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,140
So instead of the interval going from one to two the new narrow interval,

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,191
in which we know that the 0 lies is 1.5 to 2.
