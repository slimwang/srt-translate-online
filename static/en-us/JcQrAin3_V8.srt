00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Man] Now let's get some practice in first order logic.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm going to give you some sentences, and for each one,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I want you to tell me if it is valid--that is, O is true--

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
satisfiable, but not valid; that is, there's some models for which it is true;

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
or unsatisfiable, meaning there are no models for which it is true.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And the first sentence is there exists an x and a y

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
such that x = y.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Second sentence: there exists an x such that x = x,

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:56,000
implies for all y there exists a z such that y = z.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Third sentence: for all x, p of x or not p of x.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And fourth: there exists an x, P of x.
