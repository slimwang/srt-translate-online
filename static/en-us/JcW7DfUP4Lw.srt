1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,220
So this lesson, showed the power, of the object technology, for

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,330
structuring complex application servers. EJB, allowed

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:15,260
developers to write business logic, without having to worry about

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,190
crosscutting, cancer such as security, logging,

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,750
persistence and so on. As a homework, what I would want you to do, is understand

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,870
the design choices that we discussed in

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,490
the lesson and analyze [UNKNOWN] the performance

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,490
implications, of those design choices, with respect

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,620
to concurrency, pooling of resources, number of object

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:45,630
classes, lines of code and so on. And read, the paper that I've assigned to you,

11
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:51,760
as part of the reading material for this course, in this topic, and relate

12
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:58,600
the arguments they present in the paper, against your own qualitative analysis.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,300
A word of caution though, EJB has evolved, considerably, from the time

14
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,690
of this paper. But, the principals that are discussed in this paper,

15
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:12,379
apply, to the way complex entier applications are structured to this day.
