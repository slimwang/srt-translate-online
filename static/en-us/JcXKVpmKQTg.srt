Hi. Welcome to the coding portion of lesson 4.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,380
Now we're going to create some conferences. A conference management

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,940
application really needs to be able to create and

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,970
save conferences. After we've created some conferences, we're going to

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,500
learn how to run queries and use filters to

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,330
query those conferences. For example, suppose you've got a trip

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,790
planned to San Francisco in June and you want

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,950
to find out if there's any conferences going on then.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,440
I'll show you how to write the code to

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,370
find out. Then we're going to delve deeper into indexes.

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,610
We're going to look at the index configuration file and

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,960
then we're going to use the index viewer in the

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,160
admin console to explore our indexes, to make sure

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,040
that they're serving so that our users don't get index

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,750
non existent errors. Another thing our application really needs to

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,260
be able to do is to allow users to register

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,120
for conference, and the registration process

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,010
needs to take place inside a transaction.

19
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,300
Suppose you give us your credit card number, you want to make sure you've

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,040
really got a seat before the payment goes through. So, we're going to

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,440
use the registration process to practice

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,120
writing transactions. Let's go create some conferences.
