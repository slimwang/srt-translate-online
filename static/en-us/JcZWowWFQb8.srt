1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,532
So there's only two cases that can happen here, right? If inverse halt is run on inverse halt,

2
00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:09,166
either this program will terminate, or it will go into an infinite loop.

3
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:15,566
So what I would like you to think about now, what if inverse halt, when given inverse halt as an input,

4
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:22,566
actually stops? Does this mean that halt, when run on inverse halt as the program and inverse halt as the input,

5
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:31,032
returns yes? Or does this mean that halt, when run on inverse halt as a program and as an input, returns no?

6
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:35,932
Now, if you're thinking a bit ahead, you'll notice that there's a third answer here, but we'll discuss that in a minute.

7
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:43,967
For now, I just want you to tell me the direct implication of inverse halt halting when given inverse halt as an input.
