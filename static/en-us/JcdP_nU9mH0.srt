>> For a vertical line, the slope is not defined. Remember that if we want to

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,021
find slope, it would take the difference between two y coordinates along this

3
00:00:08,021 --> 00:00:12,117
line, But then, because all of the x coordinates are the same, we would have to

4
00:00:12,117 --> 00:00:16,045
divide by 0, which we know is a major no, no. Or, at least, not allowed, if we

5
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:17,479
want to define this slope.
