Awesome job in the next part of this
lesson you'll be given a problem set

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,550
that challenges you to explore
different CSS properties and

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,370
add some style to your sites.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,320
If you get stuck,

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,940
remember that you can pop open
developer tools at any time to help.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,630
>> All right, James.

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,700
Thanks for
stopping by to talk about CSS.

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,770
>> Yeah no problem.

9
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,760
>> After you finish the problem set,
you'll be setting up some tools that

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,440
will help you write code faster and
more efficiently.

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,540
Have fun with this problem set.
