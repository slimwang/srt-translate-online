1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,130
So let's discuss the memory ordering quiz solution for

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,214
this. In this situation there is a store and

3
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,582
then a load to the same address, so the

4
00:00:08,582 --> 00:00:11,542
load obviously doesn't go to cache or memory to

5
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:13,750
get its value. It's going to get it from the

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,720
store. But where does the store keep its value?

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,050
The store doesn't broadcast the result. The result is

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,330
broadcast for instructions that produce register result. So the store

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,360
really never broadcasts its results. So this

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,619
is definitely not true. A reservation station, reservation

11
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,620
stations never provide any results to subsequent instructions.

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,760
They only keep values captured for the current

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,540
instruction. The store doesn't even have a reservation

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,761
station. So this is definitely not correct. A

15
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:46,749
ROB entry would keep a result for a

16
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:50,370
register producing instruction between the time it's been

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,890
broadcast and the time it commits. But because

18
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,368
a store is not a register value producing instruction,

19
00:00:57,368 --> 00:00:59,440
it doesn't put its result in a ROB

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,066
entry, in fact, technically, the store doesn't have a

21
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:07,530
result. So this is not correct. The store

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,530
does keep the values going to store in the

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,240
low store Q, and if you remember, that

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,640
is where the load searches for a value when

25
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,910
it's trying to match its address to addresses of

26
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,830
previous stores. So this is the only correct answer.
