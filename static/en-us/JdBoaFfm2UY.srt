In the beginning of this class,

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:05,000
one of the applications of computational
photography that I had introduced

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,040
was how to build a panorama
from a series of images.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,880
In this lesson,
let's actually figure out how to do it

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,465
based on the kinds of things
that we have learned so far.

6
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:17,665
So, I'm going to basically introduce the
whole pipeline of how we can actually

7
00:00:17,665 --> 00:00:21,695
take a series of images,
find the overlaps in these images, and

8
00:00:21,695 --> 00:00:25,445
use that to generate the panorama
that we have talked about in detail.

9
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:27,795
But now, we're going to learn
the technical details of how to do it.
