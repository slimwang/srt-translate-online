1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This first one, part of testing a program feature is running the program

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
in a way that exercises that feature, that was the last quiz.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes, that is part of testing.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We have to exercise the feature and then compare the observed output

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
to what we expected.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And if they're different, that indicates a bug.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Testing can give us absolute certainty. No.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Testing can give us confidence that our JavaScript interpreter is correct.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Because our JavaScript interpreter could potentially accept an infinite number of inputs--

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
there are an infinite number of possible JavaScript programs out there--

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
we don't have time to test them all.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We can't be absolutely certain based on testing,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
but it can give us confidence.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Finally, one test input is just as good as another. No.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This was the previous quiz.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We need a test input that exercises the feature.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And if we have a bunch of features in our program, we would want a suite of test inputs

18
00:00:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that cover all those features.
