Before we move on and
create more complex tasks,

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,000
let's talk a bit about
the concept of streams in Gulp.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,900
Other built systems, like Grunt,
have tabbed their copier

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,710
files to a temporary place where
they make some change on them.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:21,050
As a result, every task incurs a penalty
for I/O in file system operations.

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,588
Gulp on the other hand, converts your
input files into an in memory stream.

7
00:00:25,588 --> 00:00:32,070
So the I/O is only done initially,
and at the very end of all tasks.

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,890
This is what gives Gulp such a great
speed increase in many situations.
