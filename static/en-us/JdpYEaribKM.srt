00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Aanswer to our quiz--we can find this out by running delta debugging.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here we are again in our editor, and now we simply invoke ddmin on the HTML input

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to find out which part of the input actually causes the program to fail.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You press on run and here we go.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It takes 10 tests until delta debugging has simplified the input just to two characters

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and this is a quote and a less than sign.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
These two characters already sufficed to trigger the failure.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This simplified input dramatically reduces the number of steps it takes us

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to go through the remove HTML model fashion.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We have a quote--if a quote becomes set, this is the error.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Since quote is set, tag does not become true and the quote gets added to the result,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
which causes the assertion to fail.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Just two characters, fewer steps, smallest state--all of these are advantages of a simplified input.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And just for the record, the correct answer is double quote and less than sign.
