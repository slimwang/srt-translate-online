00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,560
In this lesson we have learned
the difference between DRAM and

00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,880
SRAM, how they work, and
where we want to use each of them.

00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,330
Next we will look at disk drives which
have even lower cost per bit but

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,340
are also much slower.
