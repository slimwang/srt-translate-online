1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,900
Now it's your turn again.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,900
Take a look at width in the Knockout documentation to see if

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,970
there's a way to make a reset HTML changes a little bit simpler.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:14,480
We want to avoid seeing current cat again and again and again and

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,100
again in our HTML.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,560
Now this one might require a little bit of extra research.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,420
You'll have changes here in your HTML and

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,570
also likely in your app dot js in the increment counter function.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,950
You'll find the documentation page for with in the instructor notes.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,580
Take a look at that documentation and

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,520
their examples to wrap your mind around what with is for.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,590
And if you're having trouble with your bindings,

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,420
I'd also recommend giving Knockout's page on binding contexts a read.

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,230
That link is also in the instructor notes.
