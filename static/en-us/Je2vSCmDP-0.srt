1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,513
So this is a little bit trickier.

2
00:00:01,513 --> 00:00:04,292
To answer this one we have to look at the code after the procedure,

3
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:06,951
and remember we said the procedure is replacing these four lines.

4
00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:10,778
After the procedure what we do is print the value of "url."

5
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:15,243
So that means we definitely need at least "url" as our output

6
00:00:15,243 --> 00:00:17,429
and all of the choices here included "url."

7
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:20,666
But that's not all we do, so we have to look at the second line as well.

8
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:25,485
This uses both "page" and "end_quote."

9
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:30,980
The value of "page" here is the same value of "page" before the procedure

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,592
So we don't actually need to return the value of "page."

11
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:36,714
It doesn't need to be an output from the procedure.

12
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:38,132
We already know that.

13
00:00:38,132 --> 00:00:39,644
We knew that before we called the procedure.

14
00:00:39,644 --> 00:00:41,596
The procedure doesn't change the value of "page."

15
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:44,367
No sense making it an output.

16
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:48,878
So this answer doesn't make sense. We don't need "page."

17
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,216
It does make sense to make "end_quote" one of the outputs.

18
00:00:52,216 --> 00:00:54,393
The reason we want "end_quote" as an output is

19
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:56,566
we need to know where the end of the quote was

20
00:00:56,566 --> 00:01:01,215
to advance the page, so the next time we look for the next target,

21
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:03,682
we don't find the same one that we just found.

22
00:01:03,682 --> 00:01:06,760
So we actually need this, so this is the best answer to the question,

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,665
is that we need two outputs, we need both the url, and the value of "end_quote."

24
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:13,898
The fourth possibility could work.

25
00:01:13,898 --> 00:01:18,246
If we return both the url and the value of "start_link,"

26
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:24,392
We could figure out a way to advance the page to not find the same quote,

27
00:01:24,392 --> 00:01:27,009
but we'd basically have to redo all this code.

28
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:29,501
We need to look for the next quote, starting from "start_link."

29
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:32,347
We need to look for the closing quote for that.

30
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:34,709
Basically we'd need to compute the value of "end_quote" again.

31
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:37,694
So it's a lot more useful to return the value of "end_quote,"

32
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:40,801
than to return the value of "start_link."

33
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:44,000
That's why the third choice is the best choice.
