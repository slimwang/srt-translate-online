1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,390
I ask, I always ask what
you've learned recently.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:10,790
Mostly to find out if the candidate
is passionate about and he goes on,

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,840
on his own free time to learn new
things and is constantly learning.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,460
You don't want to hire someone whose
knowledge is kind of static and

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,830
he will not learn on his own.

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:28,000
As developers, we need to reinvent
ourselves, every week almost.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,800
So it's vital to see if he has this
internal urge to learn new things.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,860
And it's quite obvious that he does,

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,110
so he seems quite a strong
hire in this case.
