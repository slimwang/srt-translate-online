1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,070
So we have observed that when

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,570
the cache that we use as the L2 cache is
used alone, it has a higher hit rate.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,910
Let's look back at our example.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,680
Here, where we see that 128kB cache,

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,749
when used alone,
will have a relatively high hit rate.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:24,190
But when we use it after the level
1 cache has already been accessed,

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,160
it only gets a 75% hit rate.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,960
So it looks like the L2
cache has a lower

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,830
hit rate than the L1 cache,
which can be misleading.

10
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:43,860
So this particular type of hit rate we
call local hit rate for this cache.

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,810
A local hit rate is a hit rate
that the cache actually observes.

12
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:55,550
Of all the accesses to that cache,
this many are hits.

13
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,826
But note that all the accesses
to a level 2, level 3,

14
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,270
etc., cache, are not all the accesses
that the processor makes.

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,140
Those accesses that have a lot of
locality get to be all one hit,

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,910
and never reach these caches.

17
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,780
So, somehow,
their local hit rate is lower

18
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,170
because they never see
the easy accesses.

19
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:27,650
If such a cache was alone, it would see
this, which we call a global hit rate.

20
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,880
Essentially if we care only about how
many accesses that the processor make

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,610
go beyond a level 2 cache,
then we would really be seeing this.

22
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,650
But note that this hit rate really
includes the hit rate of the level

23
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,980
1 cache and what are the actual
hits in the level 2 cache.

24
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,100
So when we talk about the cache size and
how bigger caches behave better and

25
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,180
so on as far as hit rate is concerned,
usually,

26
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,480
we think about the global hit rate,
because the local hit rate

27
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,060
heavily depends on what do you
have as the level 1 cache.

28
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,725
If it's a level 3 cache then its
local hit rate would depend on what

29
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:09,804
is the level 1 hit rate,
what is the level 2 hit rate, and

30
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:14,245
only then we even get to
access the level 3 cache.

31
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:17,900
Its global hit rate is
going to be similar

32
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,800
to our hit rate of that type of
a cache if it was used alone.
