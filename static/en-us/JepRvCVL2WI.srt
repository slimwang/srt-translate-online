00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,480
Another feature of Flexbox that
I found to be really useful,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,150
is the ability to change the order of
elements, using the CSS order attribute.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,970
For example, when the screen
width is 400 pixels or below,

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:18,840
the elements are shown in
the order of their markup.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,680
Keep an eye on this dark blue div,
and this red div, here.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,250
As the viewport changes size, the order
of the elements starts to change.

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,689
To set the order, I just need to add
an order attribute to each element.

8
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,730
This means your content,
can be totally responsive.

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,940
In some layouts,
content appears in one order, but

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,420
in other layouts it appears
in a whole different order.
