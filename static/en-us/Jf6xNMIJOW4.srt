1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,110
So let's start with
Net Margins this time.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,520
Its the percentage of revenue
retained minus all expenses.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,580
So the correct answer is B here.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,770
You calculate Net Margin as follows.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,760
Take the total Net Profit, divide it by
your total revenue and multiply by 100.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,070
Gross margin is calculated as follows.

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,870
Take your gross profit, divide it by
your total revenue, and multiply by 100.

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:32,229
Now both metrics give us an indication
on our quality of performance.

9
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:38,570
Many companies tell you that we have
a 40% gross margin on our products.

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,560
So it can change from sector to sector,
but

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,770
you can always measure yourself
against other similar companies.

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,620
And see how well or not well
you're doing in relation to them.
