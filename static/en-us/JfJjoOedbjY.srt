00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,650
This formula we just created has a special name. It is called the quadratic

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,367
formula. And this name makes sense. Remember, this gives us solutions for

3
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:14,155
quadratic equations, which are written in the form ax squared plus bx plus c

4
00:00:14,155 --> 00:00:19,043
equal 0. As long as we can find these coefficients, we can solve for x. So let's

5
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:23,429
try this out. Let's see if it really works. Let's look at an example we did

6
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:27,821
before, and see if we can get the same answers for the x coordinates of its x

7
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:32,652
intercepts, as we did using other methods. Let's look back at x squared plus 5x

8
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:37,192
plus 6 equals 0. For this quadratic equation what are a, b, and c? Were these in

9
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:41,949
reference to the general form of the quadratic equation that we've been talking

10
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:42,393
about?
