1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So now our optimizer will correctly change this to

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
ethos times zero plus zero, that's going to be zero,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
pathos times 1 times 1,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that'll be pathos,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and logus times 2 plus 5

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
will be logus times 2 plus 5,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and you might have already spotted places where we

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
could add other optimizations.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For example, wouldn't it be nice to just replace this with 7 right now.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So there's plenty of room for creativity in optimization.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So we could do better with optimization,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but it takes creativity because we need to know

13
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
what we want to change and also when it's legal.
