1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,230
Let's apply this idea of the degrees of freedom to samples and populations.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,607
Let's say these are values in a population. We can pick any n values from this

3
00:00:09,607 --> 00:00:15,153
population to have the sample of size n. If n is five, let's say we pick these

4
00:00:15,153 --> 00:00:20,580
five. There are five degrees of freedom. If we pick a sample of size n, we have

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,353
n degrees of freedom. But then we have to calculate the sample standard

6
00:00:25,353 --> 00:00:30,732
deviation. And to do this, we need the sample mean. To find the mean, we add up

7
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:36,240
each value in our sample, divide by the number in our sample, and then we get x

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,430
bar. That means that the sum of all the values in the sample has to be x bar

9
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,966
times n, this is just like that example you did before where you have n values

10
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:54,151
that must add to 10. In that case, you had n minus 1 degrees of freedom and the

11
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:59,771
same applies here. In our population, when we need to pick a sample of size n,

12
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:04,102
we now have a restriction that nth value has to ensure that they add to x bar

13
00:01:04,102 --> 00:01:10,550
times n. In other words, n minus 1 of the values may vary as long as the nth

14
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:16,712
value results in that same sum to get the same average. N minus one is called

15
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:22,361
the effective sample size. Since the sample standard deviation depends on x

16
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:27,530
bar, there are n minus 1 degrees of freedom. You might ask, well why do we

17
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,530
divide by n with the population standard deviation if that also uses x bar?

18
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,365
Well, with the population we can't replace certain values with other values,

19
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:40,820
like we can with samples, because we already have all possible values of the

20
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,894
population. Degrees of freedom are the number of pieces of information that can

21
00:01:45,894 --> 00:01:51,354
be freely varied without violating any given restrictions. Think of degrees of

22
00:01:51,354 --> 00:01:54,953
freedom as the number of independent pieces of information available to

23
00:01:54,953 --> 00:02:00,601
estimate another piece of information. Only n minus 1 values are independent

24
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:05,936
after we know the mean. As the degrees of freedom increases, the t-distribution

25
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:09,193
better approximates the normal distribution.
