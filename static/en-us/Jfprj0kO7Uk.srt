1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,920
As we know, HTML defines the content of a page.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,930
Now that we know how to replace text,

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,600
we can replace placeholders in HTML with real data.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,630
After that, we just need to append HTML strings to start building our resume.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,410
>> Let's look inside helper.js, which through the magic of computers we

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,080
have over here on this side of the screen.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,230
It contains some helper data that your project will take advantage of.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,680
Because helper.js shows up before resumebuilder.js, which you can't see,

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,759
but it's way down here at the bottom of the screen.

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,170
It will load first, and we'll have access to all the data from helper.js,

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,160
when we start writing resumebuilder.js.

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,404
We can see a few string variables here,

13
00:00:43,404 --> 00:00:49,270
Ike HTML mobile, HTML email and HTML twitter.

14
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,928
Each of them has a percent, data percent place holder.

15
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,077
Here and here.

16
00:00:54,077 --> 00:01:00,480
And each of those will be replacing %data% with our actual data.

17
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,870
>> So how are they going to replace %data%?

18
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,670
>> The same way we replaced awesome with fun, using the replace method.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,080
>> Let's see it.

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,140
>> Let's say I wanted my properly formatted name to appear on the page.

21
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,050
In that case,

22
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,310
I first need to create a new variable that stores HTML with my data.

23
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,698
I'll save a variable called formattedName and set it equal to

24
00:01:26,698 --> 00:01:33,558
HTMLheaderName.replace, %data%,

25
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:36,180
and pass in a variable storing my name.

26
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,860
Then I will pin the formattedName to the header.

27
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,180
Voila.

28
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,290
There's my formatted name.

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:45,980
>> Very cool.
