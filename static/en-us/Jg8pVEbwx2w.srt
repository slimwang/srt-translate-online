1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,900
So to further improve the user
experience of the app,

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,820
we need to think about
touch feedback for

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,090
anything that is clickable in our app,
and that refers to the feedback

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,900
that we get from the user interface when
they touch something that's clickable.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,430
Now before we discuss the topic further,

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,180
I'm going to let you experiment on
your own with the main activity.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,720
So first, I like you to temporarily set
the background of the numbers category

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,120
TextView to be this selectable item
background value, which was defined in

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,460
the Android framework and while you're
at it change the text color to be black.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,720
So the text is easier to read and

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,910
here's what those changes will look
like in your main activity xml file.

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,040
After you've made these changes,
run the app on your device and

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,040
describe what you observed when
you click on the numbers category.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,580
So how is this different
from clicking on

15
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,930
other categories in the main activity?
