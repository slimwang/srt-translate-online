00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,375
And the answer is that these three, the ones that I've checked off, are parallel

2
00:00:05,387 --> 00:00:10,600
to y equals 4x minus 5. We can see this by doing a little bit of rearranging so

3
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:15,525
we get each of these equations in the form y equals mx plus b. If we add y to

4
00:00:15,537 --> 00:00:20,985
both sides of this equation, we can rearrange this equation so that instead it

5
00:00:20,997 --> 00:00:25,895
reads y equals 4x. This one is already written in slope-intercept form, and we

6
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:30,767
can see that it's slope is, in fact, 4. Just like that of our original line. If

7
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:35,357
we divide both sides of this equation by 2, we end up with y equals 4x minus

8
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:40,007
one-half. Here, m is the same as in this equation. For each of these lines,

9
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:44,716
however, which are not parallel to this equation, in order to get y by itself,

10
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:49,493
we would have to divide both sides by 2. This would change the coefficient in

11
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:54,159
front of the x that it's no longer 4, which means that the slope of this line is

12
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:58,477
actually 2. The same thing would happen for this equation. So, this is the

13
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:02,582
perfect example of how sometimes, even if the coefficient in front of x, makes

14
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:06,680
it look like a line could be parallel to another line. We have to make sure that

15
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,817
the equation is actually in slope intercept form before we can make assumptions

16
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:09,817
about that.
