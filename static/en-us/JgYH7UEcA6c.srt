1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And the correct answer is 0.043.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So, even though I received a positive test,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
my probability of having cancer is just 4.3%,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which is not very much given that the test itself is quite sensitive.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It really gives me a 0.8 chance of getting a negative result if I don't have cancer.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It gives me a 0.9 chance of detecting cancer given that I have cancer.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now, what comes (inaudible) small?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, let's just put all the cases together.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You already know that we received a positive test.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Therefore, this entry over here, and this entry over here are relevant.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now, the chance of having a positive test and having cancer is 0.009.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Well, I might--when I receive a positive test--have cancer or not cancer,

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
so we will just normalize by these 2 possible causes for the positive test,

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
which is 0.009 + 0.198.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We know both these 2 things together gets 0.009 over 0.207,

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
which is approximately 0.043.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Now, the interesting thing in this equation is that the chances

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
of having seen a positive test result in the absence of cancers

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
are still much, much higher than the chance of seeing a positive result

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
in the presence of cancer, and that's because our prior for cancer

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
is so small in the population that it's just very unlikely to have cancer.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So, the additional information of a positive test

23
00:01:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
only erased my posterior probability to 0.043.
