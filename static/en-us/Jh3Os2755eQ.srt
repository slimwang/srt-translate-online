1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,340
Now we said earlier,

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:05,050
the diagnosis is mapping from
data space to hypothesis space.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,080
We also noted that although we may
start with the initial set of data,

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,780
proposals of specific hypotheses will
lead us to collect additional data.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,000
Once we have some hypotheses for
explaining the available data,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,980
then this hypotheses become
indices into treatment plans.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,410
So the next step is to map the
hypothesis space to the treatment space.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,890
In case of medical diagnosis,
this might be a set of therapies, or

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,350
a set of drugs.

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,730
In case of auto mechanics
the treatment space might consist of

11
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,290
replacement of various parts or
repair of various parts.

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,984
Note here in the power
of classification,

13
00:00:38,984 --> 00:00:44,250
this was the space of percepts,
this was the space of actions,

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,490
this mapping is very complicated.

15
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,339
So we map the space of percepts into the
equal classes in these catergories So

16
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:55,583
we index the actions over the equal
classes in these catergories so

17
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:58,490
the data index the actions
of the data space.

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,910
As we exited the treatment,
we monitor it.

19
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,180
And depending upon the result
of this treatment,

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,610
we may need to collect additional data.

21
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,080
The treatment fails.

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,230
And the fact that the treatment
has failed is important data

23
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,460
that might also lead to
the collection of additional data.

24
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,410
Thus in case of auto mechanics,
if I replace a particular component and

25
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,580
the car still does not
function properly,

26
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,120
then that is useful data to know.

27
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,310
Because it suggests that the fault that
I thought would explain the malfunction

28
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,810
is probably not the right diagnosis.

29
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,350
>> We could also think of this last
phase as a type of configuration,

30
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,880
which we talked about last time.

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,880
Given a set of hypotheses
about illnesses or

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,150
faults with a car, we can then
configure a set of treatments or

33
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,200
repairs that best address
the faults we discovered before.
