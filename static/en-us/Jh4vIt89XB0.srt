1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,750
Can you create a folder structure for the project?

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,700
Yes.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,260
You don't need to know anything about the framework in order to create the HTML

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,700
and CSS files that you'll later be writing.

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,960
Can you create a DOM tree for the page?

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,690
Yes.

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,150
Using the structure of the mock-up,

8
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,040
you could pretty much figure out what the DOM tree should look like.

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,990
Can you write HTML that defines the DOM?

10
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,920
Yes, you can.

11
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,440
If you can figure out the DOM tree for

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,560
the page, you can start writing the HTML that will create it.

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,750
Can you assign class names to HTML Elements?

14
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,950
No you can't.

15
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,800
Not until you have your frame work picked out.

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,300
Each frame work will have its own custom classes.

17
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,090
Can you write CSS?

18
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:36,870
Not quite.

19
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,470
Not until you pick a framework.

20
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,000
And can you test the page?

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,300
Well if you don't have the CSS you're not going to be able to test it yet.
