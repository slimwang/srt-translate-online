00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,550
We can also transform our logarithmic functions in the same way that we have

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,240
moved other functions around. How about we start with this function f of x

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,280
equals log base 2 of x. First try graphing the transformed function f of x

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,080
equals log base 2 of x plus 2. Take a second to do this right now. After you've

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,340
taken a second to do that, please fill in the words in the sentence. To

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,280
properly describe the transformation that happened was the shift of vertical or

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,658
horizontal one, in which direction did it happen and by how many units.
