00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,330
Let's keep exploring this formula to shed insights on how the distribution of

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,470
chi squared values would look like. Chi squared values are always, sometimes,

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,298
or never negative. And therefore what would that make a chi squared test?

4
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:16,864
Non-directional or one-directional?
