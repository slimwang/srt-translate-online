1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,718
The polynomial we're looking for is simply the product of all three of these

2
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:08,931
factors, each put inside parentheses, of course. So we have f of x equals x

3
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:13,716
minus 2, times x minus 3, times x minus 4. Awesome.
