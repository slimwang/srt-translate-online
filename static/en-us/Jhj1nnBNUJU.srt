1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,960
So, I've gone ahead and

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,280
added the .error method to the end of the getJSON method.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,680
Chaining in this case refers to just simply attaching another method to

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,310
the end of one method.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,280
So, we'll run .error if something goes wrong with anything that happens here.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,400
In which case, .error runs an anonymous function that takes in e,

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,140
the error itself.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,200
But in this case we don't do anything with e.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,680
We simply change the text of the New York Times header element to

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,040
New York Times Articles Could Not Be Loaded.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,610
And let's go ahead and see if this worked.

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,090
To test this, I went ahead and

13
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,340
messed up the URL, so let's go ahead and hit Submit.

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,950
And, we can see that despite the fact that we got Rockefeller Center in

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,630
the background, the New York Times articles could not be loaded.

16
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,270
This is a good way to make sure that even if the page doesn't work the way you

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,000
think it should, it doesn't completely ruin your user's experiences.
