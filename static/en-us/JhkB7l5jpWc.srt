1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,490
In this session, we talked about
some important design patterns

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,370
like delegation, targets and
actions, and model view controller.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,860
These design patterns are woven into
the fabric of app development and

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,470
will come into play in every
application you'll build.

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,900
So remember them well.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,990
That's all for now.

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,190
We'll see you in the next session.
