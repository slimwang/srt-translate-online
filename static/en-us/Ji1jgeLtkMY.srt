00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,570
So how do you handle
setbacks at the company now?

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,844
>> One of the best pieces of
management advice that I've ever read,

3
00:00:07,844 --> 00:00:11,897
actually my cofounder Dan spoke
with Dick Coslow at Twitter.

4
00:00:11,897 --> 00:00:15,650
And Dick said something that has
stuck with me ever since, and

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,911
it's that the hardest thing about
management is making everyone else

6
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:22,020
understand what you understand.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,564
And when you think about this from
a problem solving context, first of all,

8
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:28,810
there are always problems.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,850
There's always something blowing up or
something going wrong, and

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,870
it's really hard as a growing manager,
I'd never had any experience doing this.

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,086
My cofounder hadn't either.

12
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:42,242
It's a really, really difficult
thing to train yourself to,

13
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:46,243
when something goes really wrong, don't
try and solve the problem yourself.

14
00:00:46,243 --> 00:00:50,891
Instead think of your job as getting
everybody else to understand as much as

15
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:52,675
they can about the problem.

16
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:57,539
And so, you might think that your job as
a leader is to sort of present a happy

17
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,659
face and make it seem like everything's
rosy all the time to motivate people.

18
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:04,369
But it's actually not the job,

19
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:07,914
the job is to make everybody as aware
of the problems as possible and

20
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:10,844
to help get them rallied
around solving them instead.

21
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:14,391
And so that means confronting things
openly, being aware of reality and

22
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:17,370
trying to communicate as much as
you can with the team about it
