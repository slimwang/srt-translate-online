00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:03,007
Here you go.

2
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:04,643
>> Thanks.

3
00:00:04,643 --> 00:00:06,830
All right.

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:07,600
Let's give this a shot.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,010
First thing is let's just draw
a box to represent our browser.

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:19,120
It looks like at the top of the page
we've got some sort of list, maybe.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,590
It's hard to tell because
it's a lot of divs but

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,619
I'm just going to do something
like this to represent this.

9
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:32,710
Next, there's just a lot of
text here and it's nested so.

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,700
Maybe we have like some text at
the top and maybe some sections.

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,080
Like three sections.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:47,541
Looks like there's three sections
the pre and pre-store and pre-soon.

13
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,578
So let's do it like this.

14
00:00:49,578 --> 00:00:55,220
And then finally looks
like we've got some

15
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:01,500
contact information here at the bottom
and maybe another paragragh.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,070
I think this looks good.
