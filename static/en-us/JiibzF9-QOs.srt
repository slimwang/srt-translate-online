00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,120
So lets take a look at how to
add a polyline to your map.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,700
Now a polyline is defined with the
polylineoptions() .geodesic(true) and

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,250
then you simple add a LatLng to that.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,106
You can stack these adds into
a single column as you can see here.

5
00:00:16,106 --> 00:00:20,910
Where my PolylineOptions.geodesic(true),
I just add LatLng, add another one,

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,710
add another one and add another one.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,730
This makes your code a little
bit easier to read and

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,300
a little bit easier to manage.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,590
See if you can edit
the hockey application so

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,200
instead of pins for each rinks you
have end points and a line segment.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,640
And as a result you would have a shape
outlining where all the rinks are and

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,730
the area contained within.
