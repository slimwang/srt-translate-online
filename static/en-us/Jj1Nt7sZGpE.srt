1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here are the series of x, y, and z value that hold in the program as russian(20, 1) executes.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
As you can see, there are two times when the value of y is added into z.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Once when x is 5--28 and 0 get added in.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Another time when x is 1--28 and 112 get added in,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and we get our correct answer of 140.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
An interesting thing to note here is let's take a look at the sequence of x values.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We have one that's even, another one that's even, one that's odd,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
another one that's even, one that's odd, and another one that's even.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's think for a second about the binary representation of the number 20.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It looks like this--1, 2, 4 plus 8, 16--4 plus 16 is 20. This is the binary representation of 20.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can see that these zeros line up.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The 1, the 0, the 1, the 0.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Each times it's odd, we do an addition.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Essentially--actually exactly--each time there's a 1 in the binary representation

15
00:00:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of this first value there's going to be an addition that takes place.
