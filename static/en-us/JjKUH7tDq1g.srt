1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,469
The subject for
this lesson is linear programming.

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,050
We've seen some very general tools and
abstractions in this course.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,860
It would be hard to argue that any other
combines the virtues of simplicity,

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,090
generality and practicality as
well as linear programming.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,050
It's simple enough to be captured with a
few matrix expression and inequalities.

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,080
General enough so that it can be
used to solve any problem in p and

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,060
polynomial time, and practical
enough that it helped revolutionize

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,270
business and industry in
the middle of the 20th century.

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,530
In many ways,
this is algorithms at its best.
