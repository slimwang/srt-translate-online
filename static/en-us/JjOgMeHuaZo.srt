00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,280
Generating HTML from within
Python isn't all that fun.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,290
I am sure you're getting pretty tired
of having to create these strings we've

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,630
called output over and over and over.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,250
This can get pretty cumbersome as our
application gets more and more complex.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,030
Because of that,
Flask configures a template engine for

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,950
you to store your HTML code.

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,900
To render a template you can
use this cleverly named method

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,380
called render_template.

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,900
All you have to do is provide
the name of the template and

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,483
the variables you want to pass to the
template engine as keyword arguments.

11
00:00:27,483 --> 00:00:29,722
Here I will render a template for
my menu items page.

12
00:00:29,722 --> 00:00:33,300
Flask will look for my templates
in a folder named templates.

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,960
So I'll make a directory called
templates in the same folder as my

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,930
Flask application, and from within
it I'll create an HTML document and

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,170
call it menu.html.

16
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,200
But what about when we need to get
information from our database or

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,420
Python code into our HTML?

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,660
This retrieval of data
is called HTML escaping.

19
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,100
Templates in Flask are already
pre-configured to handle escape code.

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,940
That is, the code that we
are retrieving from our application and

21
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,460
database, and putting it into our html.

22
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,300
With HTML escaping we have
access to python variables and

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,140
functions, and can even get the results
added directly into our HTML code.
