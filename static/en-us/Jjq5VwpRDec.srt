00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,100
Before we wrap up, let's go over some assumptions and restrictions for chi

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,050
square tests. Just like with all tests, we have to make sure that we're

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,460
adhering to certain guidelines in order to do this test. First of all, we have

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,660
to avoid dependent observations. In the case of the Loftus and Palmer study,

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,960
the car crash one. Independence would be violated if the participants

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,400
contributed to data in more than just one of these cells. For example, if they

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,290
were asked both how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,415
And how fast were the cars going when they hit each other? In other words these

9
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:45,010
16 participants are totally different from all of these other participants.

10
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,540
Whose data is in the other cells. Another thing we should do is avoid small

11
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,840
expected frequencies. And in general have a large number of participants.

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,690
Remember that our chi-squared statistic is just based off the sample. We have a

13
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:05,370
sample of observations and corresponding expected values. If we were to use

14
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,760
this chi squared statistic to make inferences about the population that this

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,060
sample is from then the total number of participants should be at least 20. And

16
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,620
a conservative rule of thumb specifies that each expected cell frequency should

17
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:25,350
be at least 5. Recall that in our examples, the observed and expected values

18
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,060
were the observed and expected frequencies.
