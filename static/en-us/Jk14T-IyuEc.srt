In the last lesson we dealt with Grant's monthly expenses. We found out that he

2
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:09,376
pays $1,200 each month in rent and that every wipers that he bills costs him

3
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:13,771
$6.5o cents to make. Let's suppose that this time we don't know how much money

4
00:00:13,783 --> 00:00:18,568
Grant spends total, and instead, we're going to represent that with a variable

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,805
y. Let's also let x equal the total number of wiper sets he makes.

6
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:27,950
So using this information, can you write an equation that relates y to x?
