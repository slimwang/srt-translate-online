1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And, of course, I am going to quiz you on that.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So what I would like you to do now is to think about

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
what would be a minimum spanning tree for this graph here,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and I would like you to make a check mark in each of the boxes

5
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that correspond to edges you would put into that minimum spanning tree.
