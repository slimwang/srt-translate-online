00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,950
.map is an array method
that accepts a function,

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:08,420
here represented by this box and
a rocket ship, and it returns an array.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,130
The array that it returns is going
to be the result of executing

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,860
this function against every
element in this array.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,800
Here, let me show you what I mean.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,970
It starts with the first element.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,730
It creates the array and

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,330
passes this element into the function
and executes it immediately.

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,180
So at this point,
this function is running.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,820
Then .map moves to the next element.

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,680
Now it is in the array and
executing as well.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,500
It goes to the next, and so
on until it's created this new array.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,860
And for each element in the array,
the function has already executed.

14
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,610
In this case, the array you want to
iterate against is the URLs, and

15
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,990
you'll want to call getJSON and
createPlanetThumb against each one.

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,410
Okay, and
I lied about sequences earlier.

17
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,200
You don't actually need to create
a sequence in order to use .map,

18
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,140
however there is a bonus challenge
at the very end of this course.

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,370
Your solution to this quiz is going to
be the starting point for it.

20
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,310
You'll probably find that you'll
need a sequence to solve it.

21
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:17,400
Anyway, map the URLs against the methods
you need to load the thumbnails.

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,910
When you're done you should see
the thumbnails appear on the screen, and

23
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,380
you should see the request
go out in parallel.
