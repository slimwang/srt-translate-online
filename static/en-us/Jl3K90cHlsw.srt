1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,883
All right, you're done!

2
00:00:02,123 --> 00:00:04,306
Let's go take a look at my solution.

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:08,000
Now note, you won't be able 
to actually run this code

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,014
to test any of these solutions yet.

5
00:00:10,014 --> 00:00:14,660
But don't worry, we'll be testing soon. 
Here's our solution.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,890
We begin with our unique table name.

7
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:20,111
The rest of the inner class,
lists the columns we're going to use

8
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:22,098
to use to store our data.
