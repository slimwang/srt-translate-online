00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,090
So we've talked about push and pull queues now. But

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,750
what if you just want to do something at regular intervals?

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,670
For example, perform a backup, remove temporary files or send a

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,560
daily report at midnight every day. That's exactly what a Cron

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,980
job does. It's a scheduler. An app engine cron job

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,480
is very similar to a cron job in Unix, if you

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,556
have worked with that. So, cron is a scheduler within app

8
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:26,860
engine that allows you to specify tasks that are executed regularly.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,870
Cron is perfect to use to perform background tasks, which

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,690
are not directly initiated from user activity. For example, to

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,980
run batch or synchronization jobs of different kinds and back

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,780
ups, etc. The cron job is very easy to configure

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,770
and there are two things you need to specify. First

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,390
of all, the URL that should be called. This is

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,220
where you place the code you want to execute and

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,490
then you also need to specify the schedule which controls

17
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,150
when the task URL is called and as with the Queues there is a ten minute

18
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,710
limit for dynamic instances. If you want more

19
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,020
time than that, you can use resident instances.
