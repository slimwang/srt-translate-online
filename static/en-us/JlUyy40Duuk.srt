00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,820
So far in this lesson, we've been working with equations involving exponents.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:10,270
So now let's look at the other side of the coin, equations involving Logs. Have

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,420
you ever had a hearing test? Or maybe you felt an earthquake or seen a

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:20,790
hurricane. All of these things are measured using logs. At the end of the

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,980
section, we use the properties that you've learned about logs and the

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,570
techniques that we're going to discuss. To compare the intensity of two

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,460
different earthquakes. In the equations we're going to look at, the variable,

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,575
which is oftentimes going to be x, will be part of the input to the log

9
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:43,020
function. That means that to access is, we're going to need to use the inverse

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,520
of whatever log function we have, since that will undo what the log has done to

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,800
the x. So, what does that actually mean? Well, before, we were using each side

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,640
of our equation, as the input to a log function, because we had exponents. But

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,050
now, we're going to use each side as the input to the exponential function. So

14
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:13,040
let's actually do some work with this equation. Ln of x equals 10. What base do

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,260
you think will be best to use for our exponent, since of course, we want the

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,286
inverse of the natural log?
