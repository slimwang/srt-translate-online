1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,100
So now let's take a look
at how to define and

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,320
create entities in
the App Engine Datastore.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,970
To continue the food theme that Magnus
started at the Big Table restaurant,

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,740
let's imagine that you want to
store recipes in the datastore.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,140
Maybe you like chocolate cake or
maybe you prefer rhubarb pie, but

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,850
whichever kind of dessert you like, your
recipe's going to need some properties.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,310
What are some things that we'd want to
store about a recipe in any database.

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,310
Well obviously it needs
to have a name and

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,810
a list of ingredients,and
some instructions.

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,550
And it could also have properties about
whether or not it's vegetarian, and

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,159
how many servings it makes.

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,380
All of these are parts of a recipe, so

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,790
that would make them
fields in a recipe record.

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,230
Now our data store also needs to know
which type each of these values has.

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,390
And earlier Magnus told you that fields
like these are called properties and

16
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,030
app engines.

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,380
Let's add that.

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,320
You might have noticed that these
are an awful lot like the field classes

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,170
that we saw in pretoRPC
messages in lesson two.

20
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,690
Like those, these are a way of saying
what types the various fields have.

21
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,570
But data store entities aren't
the same as pretoRPC messages,

22
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,300
so these property types
have their own names.

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,709
So if name, and ingredients,
and instructions, and so

24
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,060
forth are properties,
what is the recipe then?

25
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,580
Let's go back and revisit what you
learned from Magnus with a short quiz.

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,450
What sort of a thing is recipe?

27
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,290
Is a data store entity, or maybe a kind,
or is it an object oriented class,

28
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,680
or a property?

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,220
Select any of these that might apply.
