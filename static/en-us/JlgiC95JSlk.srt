00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,830
And the answer is yes, both of these are functions. They both pass the vertical

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:11,527
line test, which we know means neither one of them as more than one output, or y

3
00:00:11,527 --> 00:00:16,946
value, for a given x value. That means that we could also represent these with

4
00:00:16,946 --> 00:00:21,186
function notation like f of x instead of y. Y is still perfectly acceptable

5
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:21,593
thought.
