1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,090
Labels aren't too tricky.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,470
And you may have noticed that in
previous quizzes like this one and

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,950
this one, I was actually using labels.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,850
So, now it's your turn.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,860
In this quiz, you're going to
be working with this page.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,820
There are two inputs
that need some labels.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,395
The first label will be for this check
box which is asking users if they

8
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,120
want to use their shipping address,
for their billing address.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,210
And then the second one is for
this telephone number.

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,280
For the billing address
check box just use the for

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,760
attribute, but
don't nest the input inside the label.

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,310
And then for the telephone number input,
nest the input inside the label but

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,730
still use the for attribute.

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,060
Using it make sure that the screen
readers connect the label

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,150
with its associated input.

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,730
If you get stuck, you'll find the link
in the instructor notes to the Mozilla

17
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,385
developer network
documentation on labels.

18
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,875
And one last thing.

19
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:54,655
Eto and I,

20
00:00:54,655 --> 00:01:00,095
highly recommend that you test this
input on an actual mobile device too.

21
00:01:00,095 --> 00:01:03,075
Check the links in the instructor notes,
for more information.

22
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:03,575
Good luck.
