1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is a Â½ or 0.5

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
To see, let us multiply these two gaussians over here--

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,950
which the exponent becomes an addition--

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,950
we can now rewrite this as follows--

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,950
when we bring the factor 2, for these two terms in to the numerator

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,000
as our 2 sigma square,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and from that we see that the new variance is 0.5

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,750
as large as the old one when applied to the squares.

9
00:00:28,750 --> 99:59:59,999
So, as a result, you would have this equation over here.
