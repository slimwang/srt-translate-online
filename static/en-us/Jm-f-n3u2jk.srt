00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here are 3 lines of things that the computer has done for me.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The very first one you should just ignore. It'll always be there. Just ignore it.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It tells the computer that we wish to plot things.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The second and the third one were the important ones.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I define a data set--a data set is a list of 10 elements--3, 4, 2, 4, 3, 5, 3, 6, 4, 3 that I made up

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and with this line, I tell the computer that this over here is my data.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Then I tell the computer, "Please histogram plot my data"--and then this is the result I just shown you.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Here are the 3 things that we have to tell the computer.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If you ignore the cryptic "from plotting import *," then what we do is we define the data.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We list it, we give it a name called data, and we generate a histogram plot of the data.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Then we then hit run in the small box down here--you'll get exactly the plot that I've shown you

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
where the frequency of the data is plotted accordingly.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Obviously, that range was 2.8 with 3.6 as the most frequent and if we go back up to the data.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We find yet 3 occurrences of 3 with 4 into this range. This is the most frequent range.
