1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,510
Imagine that you have the code for
the messenger app.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,880
Where would we look to find a swift
statement that presents the image picker

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,970
view on top of the composer view.

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,830
We would find such a statement in
the View Controller that's currently

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,780
on screen.

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,690
The compose message view controller.

7
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,610
The invocation looks like this.

8
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,250
Now let's have a closer look
at these three arguments.

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,370
The third one is often set to nil.

10
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,470
It's a closure,

11
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,000
which is a block of code that can be
invoked once the view is presented.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,380
This second argument indicates
how the view appears.

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,479
When animated is set to false, the view
flashes onto the screen immediately,

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,200
without the upward slide.

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,640
For this first argument,

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,870
we'll need a reference to the view
controller that's being presented.

17
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,380
Let's figure out how
to get that reference.
