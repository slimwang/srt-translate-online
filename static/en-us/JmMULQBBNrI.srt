00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,020
Earlier we had code like this, where
we say renton equals new MarkerOptions.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,670
We passed it a latitude and a longitude
and we set the title as a string.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,670
Now this code set the position and
title for the pin.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,500
But we can customize this further
with another property which is

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,400
the .icon property.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,620
Here's an example.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,650
Now you can see I have the same
position I have the same title, but

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,130
I'm now using the .icon property, and

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,260
I'm setting that to
a BitmapDescriptorFactory.fromResource.

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,299
And as you may recall from
Android fundamentals,

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,890
when you use
a BitmapDescriptorFactory.fromResource,

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,420
you can then define
a resource as an R.drawable.

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,990
And I'm just using the basic
R.drawable.ic_launcher.

14
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,190
Which is the default icon that comes
with Android Studio projects, and

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,650
it's an icon of a little
android himself.

16
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,980
So just to keep things simple, I'm not
adding a new icon to this application.

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,240
I'm not adding a new
icon to this sample,

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,310
I'm just using one of
the ones that is built in.

19
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,690
You can, of course, add your own
graphics as drawable resources and

20
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,860
use them here, and
in fact I would recommend it.

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,099
Because using the little
Android icon is a pain,

22
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,340
as you'll see in a moment, isn't
the most user friendly way of doing it.
