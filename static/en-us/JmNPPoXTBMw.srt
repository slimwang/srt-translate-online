1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,100
Okay.
I'm going to just jump right in and

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,630
hand simulate what's going on here.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,090
These first three lines we just
declare three variables and

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,610
set them to initial values,
so I'm going to do that.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,660
Okay, so
that's what that would look like.

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,070
And then here in display,
I'm saying display this arithmetic here.

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,491
Let's look and
see what the values of day 1, day 2, and

8
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:23,110
day 3 are at this point in the program.

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,044
Day 1 is 15.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,270
Day 2 is 22 and day 3 is 18.

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,300
Now, this might seem a little bit silly
that I went off here to the side and

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,540
started keeping track
of these variables, but

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,960
as the programs get more complicated and
variables kind of change and

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,770
get modified in this space, it's really
important to be keeping track of things.

15
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,110
Anyways, the key insight for

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,400
this problem is that you're doing
both addition and a division here.

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,700
Now, if you remember from when Katherine
was talking about order of operation,

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,980
division always comes before addition.

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,220
Meaning the first thing that's going to
happen is this division right here.

20
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,820
So, 18 gets divided by 3, which is 6.

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,500
And then we have 15 plus 22 plus 6,
which equals 43.

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,610
So, it's going to print out 43.

23
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,840
So, is that correct?

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,740
Well, what we're trying to
do is find the average.

25
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,920
Finding the average involves
adding up all the numbers and

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,208
then dividing by the number
of numbers you have.

27
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,790
But we did the addition too early,

28
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,630
we do it before we've added
up these three numbers.

29
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,210
Really, it should be 15 plus 22
plus 18 then divided by three.

30
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,780
So 43 is not the correct answer.

31
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,790
And to make this code
do the correct thing,

32
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,780
you should be surrounding these
three variables with parentheses.

33
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,210
Then, you'll add 15 plus 22 plus 18.

34
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:44,449
And then divide it by 3, which will give
you the correct answer of about 18.3.
