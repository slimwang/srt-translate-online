00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,629
So that concludes this lesson on problem solving, but developing better problem

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,068
solving skills is reallhy a lifetime of effort. I hope some of the guidelines

3
00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:10,500
I've given you today will be useful for solving many problems you'll encounter

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,272
in the futrue. Our first step is alwasy to not panic. Then to think about the

5
00:00:14,272 --> 00:00:17,200
inputs and the outputs and make sure we understand the problem by working

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,048
through some examples by hand. Then to try and come up with simple mechanical

7
00:00:21,048 --> 00:00:24,966
solution that will be able to turn into code. And then the final step I'll

8
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:28,624
mention, which is what we've been doing the last part, is to develop our

9
00:00:28,624 --> 00:00:32,603
solution incrementally in small steps that we can test as we go. Thank you for

10
00:00:32,603 --> 00:00:35,836
sticking with the lesson, and I hope you'll solve lots of hard problems in

11
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:36,273
future.
