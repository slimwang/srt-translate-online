1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,540
There are a few different tools you
can use when thinking about tracking

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,689
metrics.

3
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:08,070
However a great place to start
is with Google Analytics,

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,600
which is a free tool Google offers
to help you easily collect and

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,300
track valuable metrics about
your marketing campaigns.

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,450
It can help you determine the efficacy
and choose the best marketing channels.

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,020
You can see how people are interacting
with your interface or

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,730
even how long it takes your app to load.

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,570
You can learn about user behavior,

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,020
you can track acquisitions,
you could track specific goals, and

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,345
you can even see what your users
are going to do real time.

12
00:00:32,345 --> 00:00:35,790
You'll want to know
what your specific and

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,100
measurable goals are so
you can easily track them.

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,100
If your goal is to get more users,
what is it that you want to look at?

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,860
Is it traffic to your site, is it how
long new users are staying on your site,

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,910
is it how many sign ups you get?

17
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,130
You get the picture.

18
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,310
Also you're going to want to know
what exactly it is that you want your

19
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,270
customers to do or
complete when they're on your site,

20
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,679
that way you can set up your account
to actually track those things.

21
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,360
Many entrepreneurs and

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,310
marketers become addicted to
Google Analytics and they spend

23
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,040
hours staring at the screen learning
their user's behavior on their site.

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,630
There are so many things you
can learn based on the data and

25
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,190
we definitely want to encourage you
to check this out periodically.

26
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,150
Every once in a while you'll have
research you actually want to conduct or

27
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,430
an experiment to measure, so make sure
you wisely track your performance.

28
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,040
Add this to your routine.

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,570
So maybe once a week,
check out some of the basic metrics.

30
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,010
For example,
what's going on with your audience?

31
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,950
Do you want to know how
many users you had, so

32
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,690
how many unique visitors to your site?

33
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,370
How many sessions have occurred?

34
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,850
So, if the user visited twice,
it would count as two sessions.

35
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,530
You also have the chance to
see your mobile overview.

36
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,580
So, check out how much your site is
optimized for the mobile web, and

37
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,350
if your users are likely to have a
positive experience on your mobile site.

38
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,560
Also how are your customer
acquisition efforts going?

39
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,510
You can check out referrals
in the acquisition section.

40
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,390
You can learn how much traffic you
get from each of the different social

41
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,270
platforms.

42
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,390
Also, learn the behavior of the users
on your site and act on it.

43
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,710
Now under the user behavior
section you can find site content.

44
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,620
Check out the behavior flow,
it's really fascinating.

45
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,870
You're going to want to make sure you're
optimizing the pages that people visit

46
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,100
the most.

47
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,395
For example, if people are visiting
a certain landing page more than others,

48
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:20,525
make sure you have a call
to action on that page.

49
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:23,155
And finally, measure your goals and
track your performance.

50
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:25,665
You can look at the different
sections for this.

51
00:02:25,665 --> 00:02:28,855
So in the conversion section,
you can track your goals and

52
00:02:28,855 --> 00:02:32,495
measure how people are responding
to your calls to action.

53
00:02:32,495 --> 00:02:35,415
Or you can see if people
are signing up for your newsletter.

54
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:38,075
But make sure you are looking at
your specific goals that you're

55
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,590
interested in.

56
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,250
>> There's two main different ways of
tracking the metrics that are most

57
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,460
important to you.

58
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,850
One way is to define your own
analytics within the app.

59
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,010
That requires a little bit more work
because you have to set up the databases

60
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,790
and everything that goes
along with it on your own.

61
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,904
The other option that's quicker and
easier, although not quite as flexible,

62
00:02:55,904 --> 00:02:58,330
is use third party providers
like Google Analytics.

63
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,237
And they can provide most of the key
metrics you need and it's really,

64
00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:03,130
really easy to get going.

65
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,325
If you do go about trying to build your
own analytics, then make sure you build

66
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:09,910
some business logic on top of your raw
data so that it's actually usable.

67
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,455
If you just keep the roll logs then
you'll end up with hundreds of thousands

68
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:16,670
or even millions of rows of data so
that you can actually use.

69
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,815
Make sure you aggregate and summarize
things in an effective manner so that

70
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:23,500
you can actually see trends at the time
>> Okay, so

71
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,230
my name is Aykut Karaalioglu, I'm
the founder and CEO of Mobile Action.

72
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:32,330
Mobile Action is a company to help the
apps be more visible in the apps store.

73
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,893
Apps optimization inside
an intelligent company and

74
00:03:35,893 --> 00:03:38,671
used by forty thousand companies so far.

75
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:44,460
I started this twelve and a half years
ago and we're based in San Francisco.

76
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,460
And we're helping the app developers to,
the product managers or marketers in

77
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,638
the horn app business to know what's
happening in the app store and

78
00:03:53,638 --> 00:03:59,040
play store and then make their app more
visible without spending any money.

79
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,160
And then I help a lot of
companies as a Grow Techer

80
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,780
to help their companies
from zero to hero.

81
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,580
And everyone wants to hire me or

82
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,070
work with them, then I, instead of work
in one company I can work everybody.

83
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,940
So that's how I started.

84
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,091
I'm in the app business, I think so

85
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:20,899
the building an app is just
20% of the total business.

86
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,520
So tracking or measuring stuff,

87
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,310
it's very important before
even launching the app.

88
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,670
So, if you know your ideal customer
profile or who the right user,

89
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,270
they can download and then start using.

90
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,120
You should definitely start
using some analytics tools, and

91
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,310
a lot of tools in the market.

92
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,220
And then the most important thing,
that is your retention and

93
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,184
engagement numbers.

94
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:48,132
So because, so four things that you
should be the successful app company,

95
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:52,955
user acquisition, retention, engagement,
and finally you can make monetize.

96
00:04:52,955 --> 00:04:54,955
So but the user acquisition perspective,

97
00:04:54,955 --> 00:04:59,955
you can get user or you just do,
pay their unpaid channels.

98
00:04:59,955 --> 00:05:03,541
But after that, retention and
engagement numbers

99
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:07,790
are the best thing because even if you
have a small number of the users but

100
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:13,180
they're all engaged and retained, so you
can definitely figure out your growth.

101
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,730
That's the reason we do believe
that 1st day, 7 day, and 30 day,

102
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,900
your retention numbers are important.

103
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,715
And then you've got to be able to know
what is your ideal customer profile

104
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:27,460
benchmark data which means what is
the average of the user that type

105
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,030
of profile they're retaining
the app after seven or 30 days.

106
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,730
And if your numbers is lower
than that benchmark data,

107
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,640
you should fix your prolog,
you should fix your audience.

108
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,590
These are the stuff in the beginning
you should be able to know.

109
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,990
Who's that app for?

110
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,410
Or, why I'm launching
today instead of tomorrow?

111
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,040
Or, what is the best time for
the seasonality for this app,

112
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,550
then I should maybe wait or
I might be late for this app.

113
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,560
These are stuff we can go for
details if you wanted,

114
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,560
but the most important things
we figure out is, for example,

115
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,320
if you're doing an app only for
holy season, so you should not, and

116
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,878
if you're doing the US, right,
is the market is also important.

117
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:18,780
Don't launch it early, like March or
April because holy season is in late,

118
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,860
Q4 which is like going to start early
October until the late December.

119
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,282
So, or
if your audience are just only teenage,

120
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:34,260
don't launch the app in the summer
season because they're probably going

121
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,770
to go for vacation or you're not
going to build that right audience.

122
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:43,660
And also, after that, if you know
the right time or right place and

123
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,510
then the seasonality is also right, so
how are you going to gamify your app or

124
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,725
just build out the audience
network in the app?

125
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:56,904
One user can be turned into
your loyal customer or user and

126
00:06:56,904 --> 00:06:58,720
then bring the other user.

127
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,190
So these are the metrics so
you should check it out every day.

128
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,150
As a company owner or,
let's say, product owner,

129
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,030
you should be able to know every
single details about every events or

130
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,120
everything's happening in your app.

131
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:19,010
So starting from the signing to
the log out or the user activity.

132
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,240
You can able to know okay, what is
frequency of the usage of my app?

133
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,710
So why people,
maybe using your app too much.

134
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,540
It might be not good sign.

135
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,220
So this is something like you should
be evaluated and daily check it out.

136
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,040
So a lot of fun stuff,

137
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,370
you can build it your own because your
final should be like the healthy.

138
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,690
It should not be like too noisy.

139
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,813
That's another thing,
you should be able to understand,

140
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:50,130
each signals can make
your product better.
