1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,710
We will be using three different
text books in this course.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,640
For the first mini course, we will be
using Python for Finance by Hilpish.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,845
>> In the second mini course, we will be
using a book I wrote with Philip Romero

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,360
titled What Hedge Funds Really Do.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,730
It's a thin book, but

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,310
it covers a lot of important material
that I think you will enjoy.

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,230
Finally, in the last mini course,

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,440
we will be using
Mitchell's Machine Learning.

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,795
>> The good news is if you're
taking the Machine Learning course,

10
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:28,310
you'll already have that book.

11
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,990
So you don't have to buy it again.

12
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,420
I also wanted to mention that we're not
going to cover all the material in these

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,080
books, so you don't need to
worry about being overwhelmed.
