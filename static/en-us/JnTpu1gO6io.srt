00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,870
Congratulations.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:02,780
If you followed along with me,

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,540
you should have a cluster of eight
nodes including the Ambari server.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,840
You know to expand your cluster
as well as configure it for

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,320
high availability of the name node.

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,970
For many situations, you won't need
a cluster running all the time, and

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,500
Idol cluster is a waste of money and
computation time.

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,740
A solution is to use an on
demand cluster such as

9
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,004
Amazon Elastic MapReduce.

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,680
In the next lesson, you'll learn how to
use Elastic MapReduce to easily create

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,430
a Hadoop cluster.
