A string is a sequence of characters,
like we've seen in the famous Hello,

3
00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:08,044
World.

4
00:00:08,044 --> 00:00:11,673
As you can imagine, a string is
an incredibly versatile data type, for

5
00:00:11,673 --> 00:00:15,500
storing everything from a street
address, to the contents of a blog post.

00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,859
In this lesson, we'll go over
the properties of Swift strings,

7
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:21,375
practice inserting
variables into the string.

8
00:00:21,376 --> 00:00:25,130
And finish up by looking up methods that
Swift provides for manipulating them.
