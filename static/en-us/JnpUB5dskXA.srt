1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,480
Let's start with a number of nodes.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,800
There are eight nodes.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,430
What about links?

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,550
There are ten links.

5
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,430
What about bisection?

6
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,805
You need to divide the eight nodes
into two subsets of size four each.

7
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:15,505
There are many possible cuts,
let me show you one.

8
00:00:16,705 --> 00:00:20,895
This partitioning cuts one,
two, three edges.

9
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:25,865
As it happens, all other partitionings
will cut at least three edges as well,

10
00:00:25,865 --> 00:00:27,435
therefore the bisection width is three.

11
00:00:27,435 --> 00:00:30,090
What about diameter?

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,560
For any pair of nodes you can check
that the shortest path between them is

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,440
never more than three.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,820
For example, consider the corners.

15
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,190
I'll let you check all other pairs.

16
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,140
What you should find is
that the diameter is three.
