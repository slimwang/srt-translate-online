00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,070
The biggest difference
between TV games and

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,780
mobile games is how players
interact with them.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,420
Instead of using a touch screen,

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,490
players control Android TVs using
remote controls or game controllers.

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,020
There are two basic types.

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,380
The first is a D-pad or directional pad.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,740
This is the basic style of remote
control that most Android TVs ship with.

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,750
For that reason,
it's very important to design for.

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,760
Just like the controllers
you may have used as a kid,

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,870
it's important to realize that none of
these buttons are pressure sensitive.

11
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,020
So pressing harder won't make
your car accelerate any faster.

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,310
This is a game controller.

13
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,740
Of course, the biggest difference
with remote control is the joysticks.

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,690
Whereas you can think of the buttons
on the D-pad as basically being on and

15
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,600
off, the joysticks, of course,
have a range of motion.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,410
In addition,
Android TV games can also be controlled

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,720
using devices connected via
the nearby connections API.

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,520
This lets players use their phone or
tablet as a second screen input device.

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,980
This opens up very cool options for
multi screen gaming.

20
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,800
You can imagine that if you have friends
over to your house to play a game,

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,420
you don't necessarily have to purchase
additional game controllers for

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,720
them, they can simply use the phones
they already have in their pockets.

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,966
Check out the video in
the instructor notes to learn more.

24
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:09,790
Let's talk a bit about
designing your control scheme.

25
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,940
First, always plan for a D-pad,
this control set is the default for

26
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,360
Android TV.

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,700
At a minimum, you should at least be
able to navigate your menus this way.

28
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,010
Even if your game is best
played with a game controller,

29
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,960
make sure players can gracefully exit
it through your menus using a D-pad.

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,210
That said,
it's best to support both D-pads and

31
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,330
game controllers in your game,
whenever possible.

32
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,720
Be explicit about what kinds of
controllers your game works best with.

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,850
Do this both in your
Google Play description and

34
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,450
when your game starts up.

35
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,880
A good strategy is to detect at runtime
what types of controllers are connected

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,320
and then prompt players if
they're not an ideal type.

37
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,060
This sets expectations properly and

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,580
maximizes your chances of getting
a good rating on Google Play.

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,690
It's good practice to show
visual controller instructions.

40
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,510
If you do so, be sure the images
you use are free from branding.

41
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,100
Down the road,

42
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,140
it may be possible to detect what brands
of controllers are detected at runtime,

43
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,990
and show matching graphics for them but
for right now, please use this template.

44
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,200
You can find this image, and

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,390
more like it, by following
the link in the instructor notes.

46
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:11,100
Here are three tips for
designing your control scheme.

47
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,980
Start with default controls that
are in line with what users expect

48
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,770
in different regions.

49
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,160
For example,
if you plan to release both in Japan and

50
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,450
the United States, make sure you set the
defaults appropriately for each region.

51
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,910
When possible, the back button
should always work as expected.

52
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,520
Usually, it should navigate backward,

53
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,750
bread crumb style through the previous
screens the player has been on.

54
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,610
For example,
if the user is playing your game and

55
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,560
presses back,
you might take them to the pause screen.

56
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,670
If they press back again,

57
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,460
you might take them to your game's
home screen and if they press it yet

58
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,780
again, take them all the way back
to the Android TV home screen.

59
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,290
Because TV remote controls though have
a limited number of buttons, it's also

60
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,930
appropriate to use the back button to
bring up a context menu in your game.

61
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,450
If you choose to do so though, make
it clear how to move back from there.

62
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,990
Last, don't rely on special buttons.

63
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,550
Not all controllers have start,
search or menu buttons, for example.

64
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,330
