1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,840
Our next question is
about a botnet operator.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,380
So let's say it compromises a number
of computers in an organization.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,856
These computers are running malware
[INAUDIBLE] by the bots, and

4
00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:17,650
they're sending lots of spam email, but
they don't look at any sensitive data.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,800
They're all just using
the computational resources and

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,000
the network resources to
pump out lots of spam.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,620
So, sensitive data, they don't do that,
or they don't even interfere with any

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,730
legitimate activities that may
be going on on those machines.

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,210
So, if this happens,

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,680
tons of spam email sent by computers
on your network, what should you do?

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,693
I guess this is one of those situations,
again, where compromises happened, and

12
00:00:41,693 --> 00:00:44,410
when something goes wrong,
how do we respond to it?

13
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,770
That's what we're thinking about here.
