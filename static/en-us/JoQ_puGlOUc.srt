Well, if you were to think of these items in a spreadsheet that

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,689
table would look like this. The spreadsheet

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,320
itself is the object, the columns are

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,730
fields, and the actual entries are the records. So the items are the

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,610
objects, the properties are the fields, and

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,510
the Udacity T-shirt would be one record.
