1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,589
Now you're done building a content
provider for Sunshine, and

2
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:05,889
you really covered a lot in this lesson.

3
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:10,149
You improved and centralized how the
weather data is managed in Sunshine, and

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,839
also built a separate to do list app.

5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,070
It was a lot of work but I can guarantee
that if you work as an Android

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,030
developer, you will be working
with content providers.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,550
So, knowing the ins and
outs of how they work, and

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,420
how to build one will
be a valuable skill.

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,380
Next, we'll be building off
of what you've learned here,

10
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:29,509
and you'll see how including
a content provider in your app

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,610
will help you load and
sync data effectively.
