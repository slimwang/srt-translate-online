00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,260
We've solved several examples of
systems of planes now using galaxy and

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,400
elimination.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,870
Before we start tackling
the programming aspect of this problem,

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,690
let's take a few minutes to
review some characterizations

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,600
of systems of equations that will
help us in programming the algorithm.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,080
Here's the first question.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,870
Which of the following statements
will be necessarily true

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,860
about a system of equations
that has no solution?

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,630
And which statements are sufficient to
prove that a system has no solution?

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,780
And let's assume for now that we're only
talking about systems of equations in

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,030
three dimensions.

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,520
The first statement is,

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,850
the planes defined by the equations do
not have a common intersection point.

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,060
The second statement is, there are more
than three equations in the system.

15
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,750
And the third statement is, we encounter
an equation of the form 0 = k for

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,440
some non-zero number k while
doing Gaussian elimination.

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,890
Check the appropriate boxes
next to each statement.
