1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now I want to talk about the H matrix.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is a matrix that takes a state, and when it multiplies

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
by that state, spits out a measurement.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Remember, we can only directly measure position and velocity,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
so that's all we want the H matrix to keep.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Again, I want to talk about the 2D lecture case and the 4D homework case.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hopefully, by comparing them, we'll be able to build some intuition,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and you'll be able to answer the homework.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What was the goal of the H matrix?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The goal of the H matrix was to take some state--

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
in the 2D case, our state was represented as an x and an ẋ--

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
multiply some matrix by that state in such a way that we extract a measurement.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In the 2D case the measurement was just x--just the x coordinate.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We can think of this as a 1 x 1 vector or a 1 x 1 matrix.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The matrix we use to do that was this one.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That was our H matrix--1, 0--because 1 times x gives us the x,

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and 0 times ẋ gives us the nothing--exactly what we want.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But now let's talk about the dimensionality of these matrices

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and how this multiplication yielded just this number x.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So we can think of x here as a 1 x 1 matrix.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We got that matrix by multiplying this one, which is a 1 x 2--

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
one row by two columns--with this, which is two rows by one column.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What we see here is that this 1 actually came from right here,

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and this 1 came from right here.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
These 2s we can think of as canceling out, in a way,

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
giving us this 1 x 1 matrix.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now, let's see if we can generalize that to the 4-dimensional case as presented in the homework.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
In the 4-dimensional case our state is now given by x, y, ẋ, ẏ.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We're going to have some H matrix.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't know anything about it yet, but I'm just going to put this there for now as a placeholder.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We want to get a measurement from that. What should this measurement be?

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's not just going to be x, because now our position includes both x and y.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So it's going to be a column vector--x and y.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Again, let's think. What's going on with the dimensionality here?

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Here we have a 2 x 1 matrix,

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and that came from this matrix, which I said we don't know anything about yet--

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll just say a question mark by question mark--

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and this matrix, which is four rows by one column.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Now, can you use the intuition we built up here

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
for how the dimensionality of matrices works with this to fill in the question marks?

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Once you figure out the number of rows and the number of columns in this H matrix,

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
figuring out where to put your 1s and 0s will be a little bit easier.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I wish you luck.
