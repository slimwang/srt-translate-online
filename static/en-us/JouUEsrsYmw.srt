1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This question is answered the same way we discussed this kind of questions in class.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
A and B are d-separated. Therefore, they are actually independent.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The first question is true.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
However, if we know E, they are not d-separated any more by the evidence that we get at E.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's the explain away effect.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A and B are now dependent. The statement is false.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The same is true for G back here, because G gives information about E,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and therefore breaks the d-separation of A and B. The statement is false.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If we add F, the state is true between A and B,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
because F is not in the line between A and B.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Finally, the final statement is also true.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
A and C meet at H, but G doesn't really give evidence

13
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that would allow us to explain away A versus C. The statement is actually true.
