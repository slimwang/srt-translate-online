00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now, I'm going to make it really difficult. I'm going to give you a coin--let's call it loaded.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So, the probability for heads will now be 0.8 and therefore the probability for tails is 0.2.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
To make it easier, assume only a 3 coin flips

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and ask the probability of heads coming up exactly once.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What is that probability for the loaded coin without giving you a head.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I recommend answering it using a truth table.
