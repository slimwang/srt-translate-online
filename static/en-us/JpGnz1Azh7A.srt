00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,160
Say we're using depth peeling or some other advanced transparency technique.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,932
We're getting great pictures of transparent objects. Front faces and back faces

3
00:00:07,932 --> 00:00:12,404
are both rendered. And in the right order. Life is good. However, we then see

4
00:00:12,404 --> 00:00:17,408
another rendering problem when we put a blue glass cube on a wood table. What is

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,800
this major problem that gives horrible art effects that change from frame to

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,891
frame as the view changes. Is it that the bottom of the cube has z-fighting with

7
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:29,133
the top of the table. Absorption of the light is not properly accounted for by

8
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:32,871
the GPU. The bottom of the cube is black due to total internal reflection. Or

9
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:36,610
the sides of the cube do not refract the light, causing black areas to occur.

10
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,673
I'll give you a hint. It's something we've covered in this course.
