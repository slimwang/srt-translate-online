1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,690
Now on to launching a cluster.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,850
It's better to use
the advanced options so

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,720
you have more control over
the nodes in the cluster.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,458
You can choose which applications
you want to install in the cluster.

5
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:14,208
Let's just stick with the Hadoop and
Hive for now.

6
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:18,250
You won't be doing any additional
configuration so skip this part.

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,120
But do read up on configuration in
the future as the default settings

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,520
such as the block size
might not fit your needs.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,530
But do read up on the configuration in
the future as the default settings such

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,770
as the block size might
not fit your needs.

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,928
Here you can add the steps that
the cluster will run when it's created.

12
00:00:36,928 --> 00:00:38,940
You can have the cluster
terminate itself after all

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,978
the steps are completed.

14
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:42,757
This is a convenient way to run
a bunch of analysis jobs without

15
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:44,098
having a permanent cluster.

16
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:48,139
For now, we'll leave this unchecked
since we want to keep the cluster around

17
00:00:48,139 --> 00:00:48,708
for a bit.

18
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:51,688
Next, you can add nodes to the cluster.

19
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:54,818
The master node doesn't need
much computation power.

20
00:00:54,818 --> 00:00:57,668
So this could be a smaller,
less expensive instance.

21
00:00:57,668 --> 00:01:01,848
Amazon suggests you should
use M1.large instance.

22
00:01:01,848 --> 00:01:05,778
The core nodes are used to store and
process data.

23
00:01:05,778 --> 00:01:08,549
You need to create enough core
nodes to store your input data,

24
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,638
taking into account
the replication factor.

25
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:15,300
By default, replication factors three
for a cluster of ten or more nodes,

26
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,814
two for a cluster of four to nine nodes,
and one for a cluster with three or

27
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:20,705
fewer nodes.

28
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:26,298
For now, I’ll just choose two m3.xlarge
instances just the default setting.

29
00:01:26,298 --> 00:01:29,468
Task nodes are used solely for
processing data.

30
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:32,968
You won’t use any now, so leave this
at 0 and continue with the setup.

31
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:37,815
You should point the login directory
to a folder on your s3 bucket then

32
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:38,808
continue on.

33
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:42,776
Finally, continue without a private key
or choose one you've used previously and

34
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:44,428
is still around on your computer.

35
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:48,568
You can use this key to SSH into
the cluster instances later.

36
00:01:48,568 --> 00:01:50,168
Now create the cluster.

37
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:51,908
After a few minutes, it'll be ready.

38
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:57,328
You can add more core and
task nodes here by clicking Resize.

39
00:01:57,328 --> 00:02:00,448
You run jobs on the cluster
by adding steps through here.

40
00:02:00,448 --> 00:02:01,590
This is what you'll be doing next.
