1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,220
So let's take a look at some spectra of some real images and

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,870
some examples, okay?

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,580
So here's one.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,920
Now, if you remember, this is Lena from way back in 1972,

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,110
and this is no relative of Lena whatsoever, okay?

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,310
You'll notice that, just looking at the image, you know,

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,910
there's a lot of power in the middle and then stuff falls out towards the edges.

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,112
And that's to like I'd said, it's often the case,

9
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:28,730
that natural images have similar power spectra.

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,320
And what really matters for reconstructing the image would be the phase.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,070
We're not doing reconstruction here, we're only looking at the magnitude.

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,990
So suppose I wanted to get rid of the high-frequency content.

13
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,290
Well here's what you could do, and

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,750
we'll talk about using the inverse Fourier transform next time.

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,990
But I could take Lena, I could take her power spectrum.

16
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,270
I could remove all the stuff out here, and then I could reconstruct it.

17
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:00,750
You can see that there's all these ugly lines in here, okay?

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,880
That's what's referred to as ringing.

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,300
This ringing happens because this actually doesn't have any high frequency at

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,380
all, but

21
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,250
you actually needed the high frequency to smooth out those little edges.

22
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,650
Okay, and so when I remove them, I end up with having just these little ripples,

23
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,250
and that's referred to as ringing.

24
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,090
And here's an example of doing the other thing, we take Lena, okay?

25
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,050
We remove the stuff out of the middle so you can see this thing zeros there, and

26
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,610
you'll notice that what's left here is essentially an edge image.

27
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,480
And if you think about that,

28
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,020
the high frequency components are giving you where the edges are, 'kay?

29
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,090
And we'll, we'll also look a little bit

30
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,340
more about that when we talk about aliasing.

31
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,390
Couple more things real quick here.

32
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,380
Remember our sharpening filter?

33
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,610
So our sharpening filter sharpened the image by subtracting,

34
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,260
by giving you twice the original image, minus a little bit of blurring.

35
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,270
So what's happened here is this is our Lena again.

36
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,070
And if you compare this one to this one, you'll notice that there's a little bit

37
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,820
more bright stuff out here than there was there.

38
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,840
And you'll notice that this picture is, in fact, sharper than that picture, and

39
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,060
that's because we've accentuated the high frequencies.

40
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,100
And one more here.

41
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,360
So here's a cool texture.

42
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,980
Here's our brick texture, right, that has mostly these lines here but

43
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,260
a few of these there.

44
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,380
And what you can see is you basically have just the verticals here,

45
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,440
horizontals there.

46
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,360
Okay. And then in this picture, okay, you've got all these angled lines and

47
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,092
that's what's showing up as all these angled sinusoids in here.
