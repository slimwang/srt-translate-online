00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,290
Let's begin by looking at the performance issues when using the pipe and

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,700
filter architecture.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,250
On the one hand, the pipe and filter style can enhance throughput

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,230
because the filters can run in parallel, that is, concurrently.

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,050
So you're overall system throughput can be reduced.

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,694
On the other hand, an individual filter may be slowed down if it,

7
00:00:17,694 --> 00:00:20,210
if it is waiting for its supplier.

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,700
Moreover, if the hardware only allows one process to run at a time.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,710
There maybe significant overhead due to contact switches among the filters.
