1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,500
So what will people ask me and
my happy with all my past investments?

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,450
I say that is the same question
like saying would you as manager

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,480
high school life the same that as
you managed them when you were a kid

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,960
knowing all you know now and
the answer of course no.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,720
I would have been great in high
school today, would had a great time.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,520
And similarly when you start investing
there's many things that you miss out.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,920
At least for me there were many
things I missed out on and

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,160
then I only learned over the years.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,960
I think that if there's one thing that
is the most critical thing is that

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,440
earlier on I think my balance between
team and idea was very different.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,000
I think that if you
gave me a great idea,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,560
or something that looked like
a great idea with a mediocre team,

13
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,510
I might have gone for it and
I actually have in the past.

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,830
Because my view was,
which was a wrong view,

15
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,990
that at the end of day the ideas
is very material in that.

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,899
The reality being at the end of the day
that as I said most companies that come

17
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,396
even with the best of ideas find out
very quickly that they don't have

18
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:07,134
product market fit which
is a very depressing thing.

19
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:11,304
You start out, you start running you
go to the customers you do customer

20
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:15,614
discovery bang suddenly you find out
that nobody wants what you thought is

21
00:01:15,614 --> 00:01:17,233
the best idea in the world.

22
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:21,530
At that point your ability to go back
to the drawing board come up with a new

23
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,135
assumption try again and
again and again and

24
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:27,430
again depends mostly on your character.

25
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,980
And so
if you believe like I do that nobody is

26
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,700
born with the ability to predict exactly
what's going to be the idea that works.

27
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,220
And even if you're born with that you
don't know what Google is going to

28
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,370
do tomorrow, what Facebook's
going to do tomorrow, right?

29
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,180
And then, you know,
you can work on something for years and

30
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,700
then Google comes and says,
I do that for free now.

31
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,550
And so it's the ability of
the founders to look at the market,

32
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,920
understand it, look at the customers,
understand their needs.

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,270
Come up with ideas that serve these
needs and enter it very fast to success

34
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,990
which is the main thing that will
determine their success ratio.

35
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,430
And so the initial idea,

36
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,990
the only thing it does is that it tells
me whether they're really smart or

37
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,630
not because really smart people don't
come with really stupid ideas usually.

38
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,889
But other than that,

39
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:13,670
I don't put a lot of focus on this and
I used to do that in the past.

40
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,470
So when I look at some of the companies
that invested in early on

41
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,090
I probably would not have
invested because I had

42
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,780
thought that some of the teams
were okayish, not perfect.

43
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,440
But the ideas were good and these
company, it's clearly did not succeed.
