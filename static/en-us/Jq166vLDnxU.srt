1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,940
And the answer here, I think, is clearly no because a real computer, of course,

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,530
has finite memory, but think about your machines.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:11,250
So let's say you have an older computer like me--so you have 1 gigabyte of memory.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,590
One gigabyte of memory is approximately 1 billion bytes or 8 billion bits.

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:27,870
Now, how many different snapshots can you have with 8 billion bits--that is 2⁸⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰ snapshots.

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,280
You wouldn't find a fraction of that as atoms in the universe.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,640
The argument is correct in theory, but it does not have any practical relevance--almost like

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,530
the halting problem, which I will soon show you also has actually very little practical relevance,

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,750
but for this counter argument, it's basically the same.

10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,820
For real computer, I think you can consider the memory to be practically infinite.

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,830
So this algorithm here just isn't going to cut it unless by real computer,

12
00:00:53,830 --> 99:59:59,999
you mean a very, very, very simple one.
