00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,050
Before we try to optimize our UI for
tablets and larger screens,

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,050
we need to first understand what
we're optimizing the UI for.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,920
Let's dig into a couple of
things we should be watching for

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,570
when designing for larger screens.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,150
For starters, we know we want to
optimize for a balanced use of space.

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,240
If you look at your UI
as blocks of black and

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,090
white, it shouldn't feel lopsided.

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,180
And you shouldn't see big
seas of white space that

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,380
throw off the horizontal symmetry.

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,880
Content should be relatively even across
the screen, or at least centered.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,090
We also want to optimize the reading
comfort for blocks of text.

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,260
That includes a couple of things.

13
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,960
First, you obviously want to make sure
that your font size isn't too small.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,510
Next, you want to sure that your
line length isn't too long.

15
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,190
Lines under 45 characters long or

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,310
over 75 characters long
are considered harder to read.

17
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:02,380
So staying within the 45 to 75
character limit is recommended.

18
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,200
You'll also want the text
margins to be large enough

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,230
to visually separate
text from its container.

20
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:14,600
Margins make it easier for your eye to
jump to the next line as you're reading.

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,240
And you'll want the right spacing or
leading, too.

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,040
Too little will make text feel cramped.

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,940
But too much, may make lines
of text seem disconnected.

24
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,270
As a general rule,

25
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,940
your text margins should be larger
than the space between each line.

26
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,660
Remember the Gestalt
principles from lesson three?

27
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,890
They apply to lines of text too.

28
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,490
So, reading comfort is important.

29
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,640
Image quality is another focus area.

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,210
If we show photos in the app,
we need to make sure they don't scale up

31
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,290
too much from their original size so
they remain sharp and beautiful.

32
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,360
We may also want to
minimize cropping and

33
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,480
try to maintain
the original aspect ratio.

34
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,180
These will play big factors
in layout decisions.

35
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,378
Additionally, we want to optimize for
maintaining context when we have space.

36
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:07,241
If a detail screen doesn't
need a lot of space,

37
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:11,537
let's try to think how we can show it
in context of its previous screen,

38
00:02:11,537 --> 00:02:17,460
using something like a dialogue, or just
showing surrounding auxiliary content.

39
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,400
And finally, let's optimize for
a clean, clear and beautiful aesthetic.

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,020
There's an art to this, and
practice makes perfect.
