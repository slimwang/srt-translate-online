00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,710
The construction of these truth tables, allows us to illustrate certain

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,150
important properties of logical predicates. To see those properties,

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,040
let us do an exercise together. So here we have the predicate A, and

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,060
the predicate B. And here we have A and B, and B and A. Please fill these boxes,

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,090
the truth values of A and B, the truth values of B and A.
