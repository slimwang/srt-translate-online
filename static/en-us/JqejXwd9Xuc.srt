1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
As we hinted before, this special syntax in HTML is called a tag.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's kind of like a price tag you might attach to a shirt or another item you're buying.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This modifies nearby text and tells you how to interpret it,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
whether you can wash it or not in a machine, how much it costs,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
whether or not it should be bolded or underlined--that sort of thing.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Another super common kind of tag is the anchor tag,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
which is used to add hyperlinks to webpages.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In some sense this is the defining characteristic of what it means to be a webpage.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Here I've written a fragment of HTML that includes such an anchor tag.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It begins here, but unlike the relatively simple bold and underline tags,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
it has an argument.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This means pretty much the same thing it did when we were talking

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
about functions in Python or math.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Here the argument or my sine function is pi.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Here the argument or modifier for my anchor tag is href equals.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This stands for hypertext reference--the target of this link.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Here I've given a string that is a URL, a web address.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hypertext transfer protocol google.com.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This text in the middle is often rendered in blue with an underline, although it doesn't have to be.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Then over here we're ending the anchoring tag. Let's see how this plays out.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Here I've the old "Eric Blair was really George Orwell" text,

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
but I've added a new sentence--"Click here for a link to a webpage."

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Right after the anchor starts, the text is rendered in a slightly different color.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
If we were to click on it, you can potentially see down in the lower left

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
that it goes to google.com.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Just to break this down, if this is a fragment of HTML,

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
then the words "Click here and now" will all be drawn on the screen.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This syntax marks the beginning of the anchor tag.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This syntax, left angle bracket slash a right angle bracket,

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
marks the end of the anchor tag.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This part in here is the argument of the tag.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It contains extra information for things that are more complicated

33
00:02:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
than simple bold or underline.
