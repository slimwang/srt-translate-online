1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,620
Now that we understand what an operating system is, we can ask ourselves,

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,320
what are some examples of actual operating systems?

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,060
The examples of real systems out there differ based on the environment that

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:13,750
they target.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,470
For instance, certain operating systems target more of

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,200
the desktop environment o.r the server environment.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,480
Others target more of the embedded environment.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,790
Yet another set of operating systems target ultra high end

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,830
machines like mainframes.

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,369
But we'll focus on these environments, the desktop and

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,960
embedded in our discussions just because they're most common.

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,460
And also with these examples we'll really focus on more recent, more

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,300
current really operating systems, as opposed to those that have been around or

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,820
that have evolved over the last 60 plus years of computer science.

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,260
For desktop operating systems one of the very popular ones is Microsoft Windows.

16
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,750
It is been a well-known operating system since the early 1980s.

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,900
Next there's a family of operating systems that extended from

18
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,757
the operating system that originated at Bell Labs in the late 1960s, and

19
00:01:07,757 --> 00:01:11,660
these are all referred to as UNIX-based operating systems.

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,872
This involves the Mac OS X operating system for

21
00:01:15,872 --> 00:01:21,164
Apple devices, and this extends the UNIX BSD kernel, and

22
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:26,357
BSD here is really Berkley System Distribution of Unix.

23
00:01:26,357 --> 00:01:30,102
And Linux is another very popular UNIX like system, and

24
00:01:30,102 --> 00:01:35,529
it is open sourced, and it comes bundled with many popular software libraries.

25
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,640
There are in fact many different versions of Linux.

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,682
Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.

27
00:01:41,682 --> 00:01:46,889
On the embedded side, we've recently seen bigger proliferation of different

28
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:51,706
operating systems, just because of the rising number of smartphones and

29
00:01:51,706 --> 00:01:56,542
user devices, like tablets, and now even smaller form factor devices.

30
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:59,310
First you're probably very familiar with Android.

31
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,230
It's an embedded form of Linux that runs on many of these types of devices.

32
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:08,360
And its versions come with funny names like Ice Cream Sandwich and KitKat.

33
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,900
Next we have iOS and that's the, Apple proprietary operating system for

34
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,070
devices like iPhones and iPads.

35
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,870
Then there is Symbian, and then there are other less population options.

36
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,590
In each of these operating systems there are a number of unique choices in their

37
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,490
design and

38
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,020
implementation, and in this class we will particularly focus on Linux.

39
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,920
So the majority of more illustrative,

40
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,220
more in-depth examples will be given based on the Linux operating system.
