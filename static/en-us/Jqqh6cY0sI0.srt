1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right, let's practice this again,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
but this time, we've flipped the problem around.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I've drawn the finite-state machine

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
accepting that phone number language that we were just dealing with

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
in the last problem.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
However, I have left the label for the edge between 4 and 5 blank.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Your mission is to fill it in.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What should this edge label be so that this finite-state machine

9
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
accepts those phone numbers?
