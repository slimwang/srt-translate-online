1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,730
>> Aright. I'm really, I'm really in to this

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,600
dashboard thing. We've got our, our nice pretty visualized data.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,620
>> Awesome.

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:12,400
>> I suspect that there is a way in Sales Force to,

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,170
kind of, get this functionality, you know, filtering data, things like

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,200
that, but in the app itself. And, like. I could imagine

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,530
maybe, there's someone at the festival whose, whose job is to organize

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,970
the electronic music bands, or the Bossanova bands for you, and that,

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,350
that person might want to just look at bands of a specific genre.

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,980
>> Yep.

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,620
>> Is there a way to filter data like that.

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,020
>> Yeah. So, that's actually a pretty easy functionality to create.

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,120
>> Okay.

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,650
>> Lets take a look here. So what we're

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,600
looking at right now is a List View of

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,490
just the recent bands. That's what comes up by

17
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,530
default. And if you click that Go button, it's going to

18
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,030
take us to the All list view. So

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,660
that's showing us all the bands completely. But like

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,230
you saw from that little pick list, the only

21
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,190
option we have is All. So, in order to

22
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,130
create a view to sort by genre, we have

23
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,349
to create a new view. So click that Create

24
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:07,800
New View Link. And so this is going to create

25
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,980
a list view of any filter that we define.

26
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,750
>> Actually going to do it Bossanova bands.

27
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,750
>>

28
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,510
[LAUGH]

29
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,944
That's a small list.

30
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:20,060
>> It is a small list. Select a banner. All bands.

31
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,029
>> You want All Bands and then we want to choose a genre field. And

32
00:01:25,029 --> 00:01:27,730
then equals whatever, and so you could make

33
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,942
these pretty complicated with filters on like dates

34
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:35,860
and this date but also this name and this genre and get really specific. Like

35
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,210
if we have multiple festivals, it could even

36
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,440
be genres but only at a certain festival.

37
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:39,440
>>

38
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,610
Mhm. Okay. And so I'm going to, let's see I'm going to

39
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,800
show the band name and I'm going to show the manager

40
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,850
phone number and maybe I want to know their Twitter handle

41
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,120
so I can Tweet them in all my PR stuff.

42
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,510
>> Yeah.

43
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,060
>> And I'll make it visible to all users.

44
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,390
>> Sounds good.

45
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,780
>> Hit Save. Anyway, with this set, there are only three Bossanova bands, so,

46
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,120
this manager does not have a lot of work to do, but that's okay.

47
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,120
>>

48
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,290
[LAUGH]

49
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,730
So I really like where we're going with

50
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,470
this. You know, we can really visualize our data

51
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,020
and get a feel of what it would be like to use the app on the day of.

52
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,480
>> Yeah. So I want to think more about

53
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,970
that because, I mean, having this visualization is nice.

54
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,450
>> Mm-hm.

55
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,920
>> But it's actually, it's not that clear to me what

56
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,530
I would actually be doing on the actual day of the festival.

57
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,430
>> Right. And you know, we haven't completely added functionality

58
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,900
into it yet, even. Right now it's just static data and

59
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,680
it's showing us information, but it's a little bit of calculation

60
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,990
based off the formulas that we've made, but we haven't added

61
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,180
too much human interaction pieces to it, you know, that actually.

62
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,370
>> Yeah.

63
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,590
>> Streamline processes.

64
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,090
>> Okay, so, can we do that?

65
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:46,890
>> Yeah, let's do that.

66
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,180
>> Cool.
