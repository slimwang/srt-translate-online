00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,840
Your task was to explore the relationship between friends initiated

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,420
and age. For the ggplot syntax, we're just going to pass it,

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,990
x, which will be age, and y, which will be friends

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,930
initiated. We'll put those in the aesthetic wrapper and then pass

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,680
pf, as our data frame. I also need to remember to

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,490
specify the geom, so here I'll use geom point for a

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,740
scatter plot. This should get me going. It looks like that

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,500
I used the wrong variable here, so looking at my data

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,520
I can see that friendships initiated should be my variable,

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,180
rather than friends initiated. Running this code, we can see

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,250
our scatter plot. Now, I still get this discreteness with

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,080
age, so I'm going to jitter our points. Here, I'll use an

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,670
alpha set to one tenth, so I'll need ten points

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,970
to make just one of these. That's looking a little bit

15
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,590
better. Another way to jitter the points is to still

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,390
use geom_point. But then to set the position equal to jitter.

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,710
This code will produce the same plot that we have here. Let's

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,680
run it to be sure. Sure enough, we have the same plot.

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,090
And since I still have really high values for some of my

20
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,590
friendships initiated, I'm going to use a cord transformation and take the

21
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,460
square root of the y axis. When I add the cord trans-layer

22
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,670
and run this code I see that I get an error message.

23
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,400
This should make sense since some of my friendships initiated have a

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,610
count of zero. So, when I take the square root of that number

25
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,100
with some noise, it might be negative which would be

26
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,210
an imaginary result. So, I'm going to fix this code like we

27
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,860
had before, so that way we have the positions set equal

28
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,244
to h equals 0. So, we'll set position equal to position

29
00:01:28,244 --> 00:01:31,810
jitter and we'll pass it h equals 0. This is

30
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,030
the plot that I came up with. Now, you might have

31
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,380
had something slightly different, or you might have even used a

32
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,770
different transformation. Whatever you found,

33
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,650
and whatever your observations may be,

34
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,330
share them in the discussions. We'd love to hear from you.
