1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,530
Let's look at the answer
to our cache quiz.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,570
These three are very similar
to the options we have

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,689
when we want to get
books from a library.

4
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:11,670
This is like going to the library every
time we need to look up something, and

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,790
clearly we don't want to do that.

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,040
Main memory is just like the library,
slow and very large.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,710
So if we go to the main memory every
time, we're spending a lot of time just

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,150
waiting for
the main memory to respond with data.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,600
Having the small memory inside the
processor core and bringing the stuff we

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,589
access there is the approach of
basically caching the memory locations.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,190
And this is very similar to borrowing
the book from the library so that we can

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,450
use it for awhile while we're interested
in a topic and then return it.

13
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,700
And finally having a huge memory next
to our processor and then bringing

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,995
everything in there is solving some of
the problems of going to the main memory

15
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:55,990
because this memory is hopefully
somewhat closer to a processor.

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,920
But this memory is still going
to be large and thus very slow.

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,460
So this is very similar to just
building a library closer to home.

18
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,110
Yes, you are saving some
time on each access but

19
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,100
most of the time you spend
per access is still there

20
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,640
simply because it takes a while to
find data in such a large memory.

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,940
So caches are exploiting spacial and
temporal and locality.

22
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,960
And overcoming the problem of having
a slow and large main memory, just

23
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,430
like borrowing books from the library
is exploiting spacial and temporal

24
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:33,850
locality, and overcoming the problem
of accessing a huge library slowly.
