00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,590
Let us try a couple of simple exercises. So here we have A, B and

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,610
we want to find a truth value of A or not B.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,190
Given these values for A and B, can you please write down the truth values for

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:21,050
A or not B. And similarly, for not A and not B
