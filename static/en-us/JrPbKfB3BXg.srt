1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,899
(Sebastian) So welcome to our last and final office hours in the introduction to artificial intelligence.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:11,166
The fact that you're watching them means you're an amazing student, you've gotten this far,

3
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:13,799
and you're just about to hit the final exam.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,732
(Peter) Congratulations to everybody for making it this far. It's been a great experience interacting with you

5
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:23,432
and getting a chance to teach this class. Let's go to some of the questions you had this week.

6
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:29,432
(Sebastian) So here's a question by (Dudur) from New Jersey. "I thoroughly enjoyed this class." Thank you.

7
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:37,032
"Would it be possible for us to use our email addresses," that you provided, "to notify you of future classes?

8
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:42,066
"I would be very interested in taking additional online classes. Thanks for an awesome class."

9
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:47,732
(Peter) Yeah, so I never had somebody say, "Please spam me," before, but if that's what you want, then yes,

10
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:53,366
We can notify you. (Sebastian) But that isn't spam, come on. (Peter) No, no. (Sebastian) Email you want.

11
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:57,866
(Peter) This would be welcome mail. So, sure, we'll keep you posted. (Sebastian) Yeah, it's been a privilege,

12
00:00:57,867 --> 00:01:03,799
actually, having all of you in class, and it'd be great to have you in future classes, if we do some.

13
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,132
"It's been an amazing experience. I'd just like to know if there's going to be a continuation of the class next semester?

14
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:15,766
"Say, advanced A.I.? Or something along those lines, like introduction to robotics." This is from Vikram360

15
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:23,299
in Bangalore, India. (Peter) Well, Sebastian and I are about to take a little vacation at the end of this week.

16
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:29,466
We're both taking off. So there won't be anything right away. In the spring there'll probably be more,

17
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:37,299
although I think we're looking more at lower level courses rather than advanced classes as the next step.

18
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:42,466
But there'll be more classes coming up. Stanford is offering another set of classes.

19
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:49,899
There's one on natural language processing in A.I. and one on machine learning and one on probabilistic graphical models,

20
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,032
so there is lots of opportunities for other classes.

21
00:01:54,033 --> 00:02:01,666
(Sebastian) ]"How long will the lectures be available after the class? I've missed a few--work plus seven-month-old twins."

22
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:07,666
(Peter) Congratulations. (Sebastian) Congratulations, (unintelligible--children's names)

23
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:14,432
"And would like to refer back to them, without the interactive bits, perhaps, or at least I would like to be able to take notes.

24
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:17,166
"And thanks for the excellent course."

25
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:24,132
(Peter) Well, you're welcome. Yeah, so the videos are up on YouTube, and I guess they'll stay there.

26
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:29,166
We're a little bit torn about trying to figure out what to do with the class after it's gone.

27
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:34,399
We want the materials to be available for everybody to see whenever they want to see them.

28
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,199
But on the other hand, we really appreciated what happened in terms of the interaction in this class,

29
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,632
where you all were participating in discussion forums with each other, and the material is always there,

30
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:51,132
then there's not that possibility of bringing people together at a specific time.

31
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:57,466
So I think that at least the videos themselves will always be available, but in terms of running it as a class,

32
00:02:57,467 --> 00:03:01,199
we'll probably keep doing that at specific time periods.

33
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,232
(Sebastian) So Anwar Asharia from Kathmandu, Nepal, a city I'd love to go to at some point, asks the question,

34
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:14,132
"I'd like to suggest providing a download package for the quizzes and videos on Flash or some app,

35
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:18,566
"for future reference or for the advanced track students."

36
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:23,332
(Peter) Yeah, I think that's a great idea. We've certainly had a lot of people talk about the problems of

37
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:29,432
getting enough bandwidth and slow connections and so on. So I think we should have some way of

38
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:36,566
delivering that locally or mailing out media or some way to get it available to you.

39
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:42,466
(Sebastian) Julia (unintelligible) asks, Italy, "I would like to know your opinion of your goal to make this class

40
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:48,566
"to make this class the same level as Stanford's class is achieved, but I think you have to make adjustments."

41
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:52,499
And she says, "Thanks so much for this opportunity."

42
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,699
So I think we did achieve the goal. It's somewhat different from the in-class experience, which is more lecture-centered,

43
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,832
and we deliberately made it more tutorial-esque, which is we asked lots of questions.

44
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:07,432
But the material covered is the material we cover in the Stanford class, and the quizzes and homework assignments,

45
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:12,866
exams are identical. And we will, of course, release statistics afterwards to see how online students scored

46
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:18,565
in comparison with the Stanford students. But I can assure you, what you've learned is as much and

47
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:20,999
as little as Stanford students learn in this class.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,366
(Peter) I agree with that in terms of material--it's the same material. The only difference was in terms of

49
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:33,266
the programming assignments that the Stanford students did, and we just didn't feel like we could handle

50
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:39,866
the logistics of doing all that. And hopefully next time we'll figure out how to handle programming assignments as well.

51
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:45,966
(Sebastian) Question by Sayitt, no location. "What would you recommend for someone who might be interested

52
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:54,799
"to pursue research in artificial intelligence? For example, as a Ph.D. Whose only exposure (unintelligible) was this class."

53
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,299
(Peter) I would say get some more exposure. Take one of the other classes, read some books, read some articles,

54
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:08,699
work on a project. Either start a project of your own or join an existing project, and get some more experience,

55
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,399
both to see if you like it and it's really for you, and to get a chance to prove yourself.

56
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,932
(Sebastian) Yeah, and to me it's all about pursuing passion. So if you're in the age where you can afford

57
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:24,566
taking time off and get into a university--maybe you are a student already--just do it.

58
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:30,732
When I worked at my initial college in Hinterstein, there wasn't anybody teaching A.I.

59
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:38,966
And when I moved to University of Bonn, there was one professor, but what he taught wasn't relevant to modern A.I.

60
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:44,532
So I mostly just did it by myself because I really cared. And if you work really hard and you're going to be excited,

61
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:50,466
then, and you wait long enough, then all of a sudden doors open themselves, and you find yourself,

62
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:55,699
I don't know, as a professor, if you wait long enough and work hard enough.

63
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:02,466
It's a fascinating thing. The Ph.D. in general I think is an amazing experience, in that it really affords you a couple of years

64
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:06,966
of time to do free thinking, and you learn the skill of how to become a researcher.

65
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:14,299
And I wouldn't want to miss a day of Ph.D. experience at this point. In fact, I often think back how good life was

66
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,099
as a Ph.D. student, when I didn't have to work really hard, because I didn't have to teach classes

67
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,966
and bring in research grants and all this work.

68
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:31,032
Okay, here's one from Siri in Rockford, Illinois. I like your iPhone app.

69
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:38,432
The question is, "What's the criteria for getting into Stanford? Will taking this class help?"

70
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:43,966
(Sebastian) So I just want to point out, this is not the Siri of Apple. It's a marketing--it's a real person named Siri.

71
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:48,466
(Peter) It's a different Siri. (Sebastian) Which is much more interesting, much more valuable than what Apple

72
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:55,032
has put out, even though I like Siri on Apple. Now, it turns out getting into Stanford is a bit of an art.

73
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:59,699
There's a number of formal requirements, such as you have to take, for undergraduate, an SAT,

74
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,799
and for graduate admission, a GRE. And if you look at the test results, you'll already have a good guess

75
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:13,132
whether you have a chance. Specifically for graduate admissions, it's good to have research experience.

76
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:19,266
It's really important to write an enticing, engaging, but really honest statement of purpose.

77
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:28,099
Honesty is a really big thing here. Be excited, but we get a good number of statements that we think aren't quite

78
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:34,666
kind of overdone. And then the last thing that's really important is, if you have done great work

79
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:38,832
and done it in a university setting or some other setting, there's probably who could attest to this.

80
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:43,332
So find really good letter-writers. It's not important that the letter-writers are famous; it's much more important

81
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:47,899
that they know you really well. So don't go for famous people, go for people who know you really well.

82
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,132
And they have to write you a really excited letter to get into Stanford, of any other college.

83
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:58,466
(Peter) I'd say when I finished my undergrad and then I worked for two years and then I decided to go back

84
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:05,332
to grad school and I looked at the Stanford application. And at that time they actually published the scores

85
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:10,099
of everybody who was admitted the previous year. And I looked at those and I saw all the perfect scores,

86
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,632
and I said, "Maybe I should apply someplace else," and I ended up, Berkeley took me and Stanford didn't.

87
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:21,766
(Sebastian) Oh, what a loss for Stanford. What did they know? I guess the first time I applied was as a faculty member

88
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:28,966
at Stanford. That was my first interview. Don't get intimidated. There's many, many amazing people out there.

89
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:35,299
What I find generally sad is that there's many more amazing people than Stanford and MIT and Berkeley can take.

90
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:41,932
And I wish this was a more open situation, that people could also-- I don't know, not everyone's life is perfect.

91
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:45,899
Sometimes you spend a couple years doing something else, and it looks a little bit shabby on a c.v.,

92
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,732
but usually an amazing person. I'm pretty sure that my c.v. would have been completely inadequate to be admitted

93
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:57,632
to Stanford, because I came from what, at the time, was the worst computer science department in Germany.

94
00:08:57,633 --> 00:09:02,966
Ranked number 53 out of 53 computer science departments. And there's a path.

95
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:09,499
And if you don't get admitted to Stanford, just enjoy what you're doing, and do it well, and enjoy the moment.

96
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,933
I think much more important than any school, in my opinion.
