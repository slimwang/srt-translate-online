1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,759
Well if you look at the blue line,
it seems like its close to failing.

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:05,620
It's too close to two of the points.

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,650
If we were to pertobate it minimally,
it would misclassify one or more points.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,670
The yellow line though seems
to be nicely spaced, and

5
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:16,068
as far as it can from all the points.

6
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:19,739
So it seems like the best
line is the yellow line.

7
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:23,190
Therefore, if you said the yellow line,
we agree.

8
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:28,000
And now the question is,
how do we find this yellow line?

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,730
Well before finding the yellow line,

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,308
let's actually find a measure that tells
us that the yellow line is better.

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,864
So the first observation is that these
points far away from the boundary,

12
00:00:38,865 --> 00:00:41,320
didn't matter much to our decision.

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,789
So let's forget about them, and

14
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:44,799
only consider the points
close to the boundary.

15
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:49,699
Actually, what we really have to focus
is the distances from the points

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,760
to the two lines.

17
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:54,899
And what tells us that
the yellow line is better?

18
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,969
Well the yellow line is better because
somehow it's farther from the points

19
00:00:58,969 --> 00:00:59,799
than the blue line.

20
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:03,859
So we can just look at these four
distances and notice that the smallest

21
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:08,209
of those four distances, is our measure
of how close the line is to the points.

22
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:12,039
This means that what we have to
consider then is the minimum

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,870
of the four distances.

24
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,250
That's our measure of how close
the line is to the points.

25
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:21,039
We'll call this measure the distance.

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,790
So we conclude that
the yellow line is better.

27
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,700
Because the minimum for
all these distances is larger for

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,170
the yellow line, than for the blue line.

29
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:34,169
So this is the function we need to work
with, the minimum of the four distances.

30
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,450
And our goal is to make that
minimum as large as possible.

31
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,500
In other words,
we need to maximize the distance.

32
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:43,979
And how do we maximize this distance?

33
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,640
You guessed it, with gradient descent.

34
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,379
There are also other methods we can use
which we will learn during the class.

35
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,040
This method is called
support vector machine.

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,310
The word support comes from the fact
that the points close to the boundary

37
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,060
are called the support.
