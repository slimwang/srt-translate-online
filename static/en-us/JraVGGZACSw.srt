1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:04,725
The function gulp.watch takes
the same kind of first argument as

2
00:00:04,725 --> 00:00:08,510
grunt.source and that's the path and
the type of file.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,580
So we can copy that from the styles
test that we did a little bit earlier

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,600
to say watch all of these SCS files.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,980
The second argument can either be
a callback like in the task function or

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,140
an array with a set of tasks.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,120
In this case, we want to execute the
styles task when a sass file is changed,

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,050
so this is what we'll do.
