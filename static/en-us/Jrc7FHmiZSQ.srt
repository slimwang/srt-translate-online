1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,160
With this proof, we've actually shown
something even stronger than the duality

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,390
theorem which we set out to show.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,120
Because we actually gave a way to
determine the dual optimal solution.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,825
We'll start with a linear program
in standard form as usual.

5
00:00:13,825 --> 00:00:18,401
And we'll let the columns of
the matrix B form an optimal basis,

6
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:22,322
meaning that it generates
an optimal basic solution.

7
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:26,549
Then y transpose, defined to be
CB transpose times B inverse is

8
00:00:26,549 --> 00:00:31,725
an optimal solution to the dual
problem by our previous argument.

9
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:34,595
Moreover, the optimum values
of the problems are equal.
