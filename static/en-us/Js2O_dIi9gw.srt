1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,339
So what can that hacker still do?

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:04,043
So this brute force guessing,

3
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:07,140
they'll have to get hold of
the shadow password files.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,660
They'll learn the hash values.

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,050
So let's say there is
a compromise of the system and

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,110
that file is exfiltrated or
something like that.

7
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,473
In fact in the past year or

8
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:19,730
two, there have been several examples
where LinkedIn and Adobe and

9
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,480
others had these password,
derived values from password files,

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,180
those were stolen by hackers and
actually made widely available.

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,729
So if you have these hash values,
let's say if you get a hold of them,

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,740
you're doing brute force
guessing of passwords.

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,340
How hard is this task?

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,732
One thing we can do is we have
some hardware software and

15
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:44,066
whatever hash function here,
we're talking MD5.

16
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:46,550
That's one of the hash
functions that is used.

17
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,690
Publicly available
software that we have, and

18
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,022
certain kind of hardware that is
common and quite popular for graphics.

19
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:56,617
GPUs are graphics processing unit, and

20
00:00:56,617 --> 00:01:00,740
they're particularly well suited for
doing password kind of calculations or

21
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,030
brute force kind of attacks
we're talking about.

22
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,013
So a GPU with available software
can do 10 to the power 8.

23
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:14,710
So that's 100 million hashes it
can compute and check per second.

24
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,332
Okay, so if the password is only,
let's say six random upper or

25
00:01:19,332 --> 00:01:24,297
lowercase, okay, 26 lowercase,
26 uppercase, all digits,

26
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:27,993
that will give us 62 total
number of characters.

27
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:32,702
If you have 62 possibilities,
and it's 6 characters long,

28
00:01:32,702 --> 00:01:36,680
the first character, there's 62 choices.

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,692
The second character,
there's 62 choices, the 6th character,

30
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:42,120
there's 62 choices.

31
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,220
So total number of possible passwords
we can have is 62 times 62,

32
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,490
6 times, or 62 to the power of 6.

33
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,350
If you actually do your calculation,
you see how much that is.

34
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,807
Divide that number by 10 to the power 8,

35
00:01:57,807 --> 00:02:00,483
because that's how many
we can do per second.

36
00:02:00,483 --> 00:02:04,291
If you try to find that out,
you'll see that this calculation, or

37
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:08,098
this brute force attack,
guessing attack we're talking about,

38
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,600
can be carried out in about 10 minutes.

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,640
One thing we do is we increase
the size of the password.

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,370
We ask people to pick longer passwords.

41
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,910
So from six if we go to eight,
of course, the effort for

42
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,300
that hacker is going to go up.

43
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,416
It's going to go up
from minutes to days.

44
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:29,472
But if you take eight random characters
of the same kind, you would actually

45
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:34,170
get 62 to the power of 8,
because there are 62 choices for each.

46
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,460
If you add special characters, the
calculation would change a little bit,

47
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,670
but if you calculate this number, again
divide this by 10 to the power of 8,

48
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,170
it's going to give you 6 days.

49
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,586
You don't have to limit yourself
if you're the attacker to one GPU.

50
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:50,338
If you add GPU, this kind of
computation can be done in parallel and

51
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,702
you can reduce the time
if it's too long.

52
00:02:52,702 --> 00:02:56,850
But the idea here is that brute force
guessing of passwords, even when

53
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,510
they're reasonable respectable length,
is certainly doable for an attacker.
