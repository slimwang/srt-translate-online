1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,149
How does first order logic work?

2
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:02,830
What does it do?

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,820
Well, like propositional logic,
we start with a model.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,643
In propositional logic, a model was
a value for each propositional symbol.

5
00:00:12,643 --> 00:00:16,713
So, we might say that the symbol, P,

6
00:00:16,713 --> 00:00:21,053
was true and the symbol, Q, was false.

7
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:25,999
And that would be a model that
corresponds to what's going on in

8
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:26,650
a possible world.

9
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:29,839
In first order logic
the models are more complex.

10
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:32,280
We start off with a set of objects.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,439
Here, I've shown four objects,
these four tiles.

12
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:38,539
But we can have more objects than that.

13
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,990
We could say, for example,
that the numbers 1, 2, and

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,980
3 were also objects in our model.

15
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,178
So we have a set of objects,

16
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:53,260
we can also have a set of constants
that refer to those objects.

17
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:58,251
So I could use the constant names, A,

18
00:00:58,252 --> 00:01:01,219
B C, D, 1, 2, 3.

19
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:05,605
But I don't have to have a one-to-one
correspondence between constants and

20
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:06,770
objects.

21
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:11,034
I could have two different constant
names that refer to the same object.

22
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:16,030
So I could also have, say, the name CEE,
that refers to this object.

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,120
Or I could have some of the objects
that don't have any names at all.

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,620
But, I've got a set of constants and
I also have a set of functions.

25
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:30,870
And a function is defined as
a mapping from objects to objects.

26
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:36,050
And so, for example,
I might have the number of function that

27
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:39,329
maps from a tile to
the number on that tile.

28
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:46,079
And that function, then, would be
defined by the mapping from A to 1, and

29
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:53,012
B to 3, and C to 3 and

30
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:57,170
D to 2, and
I could have other functions as well.

31
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,200
And, in addition to function,
I can have relations.

32
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,169
So, for example, I could have
the above relation, and I could say

33
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:13,380
in this model of the world, the above
relation is a set of two pulls.

34
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:18,120
Say, A is above B, and C is above D.

35
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,620
So that was a binary relation
holding between two objects,

36
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,129
say, one block is above another block.

37
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:28,960
We can have other types of relations.

38
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,200
For example,
here's a unary relation, vowel.

39
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,250
And, if we want to say the relation
vowel is true only of the object

40
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:46,414
that we call A, then that's a set of
tuples of length 1 that contains just A.

41
00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:49,739
We can even have relations
over no objects.

42
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,480
So, say we wanted to have the relation
rainy, which doesn't refer to any

43
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:57,259
objects at all,
it just refers to the current situation.

44
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:02,859
Then, since it's not rainy today,
we'd represent that as the empty set,

45
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,800
there's no tuples corresponding
to that relation.

46
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,560
Or, if it was raining, we can say that
it's represented by a singleton set.

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,770
And since there's
the arity of rainy is zero,

48
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,469
there'd be zero elements in
each one of those tuples.

49
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:23,289
So that's what a model in
first order logic looks like.
