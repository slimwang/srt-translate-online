00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,720
Great, so you know how to chop up a webpage design into boxes and

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,410
you've even heard advice from an experienced front end developer.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,370
Let's take a look at another very simple example.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,620
How do you transfer this to an HTML document,

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,170
and how do you change how the boxes look?

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,410
Let me quickly show you how to translate the model to HTML.

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,080
And then you will write it in a file that you can open in your browser.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,610
In this design, you can see that there are four boxes.

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,000
We have one over the title, another over this content, and

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,320
then two more boxes inside of this larger box.

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,810
One around the image, and another around the text.

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:44,790
So let's not worry about how these boxes look or what's inside of them.

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,190
And let's not worry that I haven't actually perfectly aligned the top of

14
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,330
this box with that one.

15
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,200
It's driving me crazy but we don't have to worry about it right now.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,870
Now you can define this type of box with a div tag.

17
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,040
We'll write this code using Sublime Text and

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,190
we suggest that you use either this code editor or something similar.

19
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,360
Now we define boxes with div tags.

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,470
So let's go ahead and create tags for each of our boxes.

21
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,770
First, we'll start with the title box and start typing div.

22
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,350
Now this is the really nice thing of using a code editor like Sublime Text.

23
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,880
It automatically is guessing what we might use.

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,820
So, we do know we want it to be a div, we can click tab, and

25
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:34,150
now we have the completed HTML tags, an opening tag, and a closing tag.

26
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:39,480
Next we have another box for the content which requires another div tag.

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,120
And now within this box, we have two more boxes.

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:50,830
So we'll hit another line, so now we have four div tags for our four boxes.

29
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,220
Now let's add some placeholder content so

30
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,460
that we remember which boxes each of our tags refer to.

31
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,000
So our first one is for our title, which is, My App.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,160
And then we have our image and our text.

33
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,340
Now that's great.

34
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,830
But how do you apply a style to them?

35
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,620
The boxes are of different sizes and they're in different locations.

36
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,750
And you need to somehow mark them so that you can easily apply style later.

37
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,690
Now the best way to do this is to give each element a class attribute.

38
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,370
Now, you can think of these class attributes as labels on boxes,

39
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,830
something that reminds you of what's inside of them.

40
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,860
For example, when you move you might give a box a label to let

41
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,930
the movers know where it might go.

42
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,790
For example, master bedroom or kitchen.

43
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,110
Now boxes can also have several labels and

44
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,550
the same applies to HTML tags, they can belong to multiple classes.

45
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,020
Now back to our moving example,

46
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,530
you might want to say the items that go to the kitchen are also fragile.

47
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,250
So, you might add Handle with Care.

48
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,390
It's a good idea to have class names that make sense so

49
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,900
that you understand what the purpose of the box is just by glancing at the code.

50
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,674
For example, while you could just give the divs class names like box 1,

51
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:08,300
box 2, et cetera.

52
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,970
It's not really informative.

53
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,650
I mean, will you really remember that you called this title box box1?

54
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,360
Probably not.

55
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,650
What would make more sense is to name the top div title, and

56
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,210
then the bottom big div app.

57
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:28,640
Then the div that contains the application image, screenshot.

58
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,680
And the text one, description.

59
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,610
Excellent.

60
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,740
We now have the general structure of the page down.

61
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,380
So, now it's your turn to save this in a file and

62
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,090
see how it looks in the browser.

63
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,870
Instructions for doing so follow.
