1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,230
It's tempting.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,520
Especially when you're starting to
look at screen reader accessibility,

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,420
to add tab index to seemingly
important elements like headers, for

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,320
instance, in order to help out the user.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,350
That's actually counterproductive.

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,940
Normally, you only want to add focus
behavior to interactive controls like

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,640
buttons, tabs, drop downs, or anything
that the user might provide input to.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,590
If you're worried about visually
impaired users missing out on your

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,220
content, don't be.

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,940
We're going to show in the next few
lessons how screen reader users

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,690
explore non interactive content.

12
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,950
So when you're adding a tab index
attribute, stop and ask yourself,

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,050
is this something the user
is going to interact with?

14
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,220
If the answer is no, you almost
certainly want to leave it alone

15
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,200
with the exception of a few caveats
which will cover in just a moment.
