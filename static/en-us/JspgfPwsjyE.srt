00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,440
This lesson will explain what happens
when we execute more than one thread or

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,040
process at the same time.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,780
This used to be what happens
only in super computers and

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,560
high-end servers, but now and
in the future, almost every computer

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,590
will have more than one core and
possibly more than one thread per core.

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,800
So it can be said that all processing
today really is multiprocessing.
