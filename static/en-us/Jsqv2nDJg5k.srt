00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,820
If you've ever used Google Maps, you may
have noticed that not only can you zoom

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,780
down to street level, but you can
also see what the location looks like

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,440
as if you were standing
there looking around.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,290
This is called Street View.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,800
It's an incredible, immersive technology

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,510
that allows you to explore the world
without leaving your desk.

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,390
If you think that's an exaggeration or
over marketing,

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,940
here's an example of street view
that actually happened to me.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,440
As well as working for Google,

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,790
I've authored a number of very popular
young adult science fiction novels.

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,490
Two of the locations that I
have used in these novels

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,290
are the town of Shiprock in the Navajo
reservation in New Mexico, and

13
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,050
the town of Kawatana just
outside Nagasaki in Japan.

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,910
I've never been to either place,
but I've gotten fan

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,880
mail from people who live in them asking
me to say hi the next time I'm in town.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,950
I did all of my location
research using Google Maps, and

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,470
in particular Google Street View.

18
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,130
The great news as an android developer,

19
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,980
is that all of this imagery is
available to you using Google's APIs.

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,360
Let's take a look at a simple
street View application

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,060
that allows you to
hike the Grand Canyon.
