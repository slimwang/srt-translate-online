1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,860
Currently, all the list
items have the same layout.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,880
However, we want the today
item to use a different layout

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,320
which we defined earlier in the list
item forecast today XML file.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,460
This is where adapter item
view types will save the day.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,530
This is a general concept for
all adapters, not just cursor adapter.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,180
Instead of just knowing about one item
view type which yields the same layout

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,570
for all list items, the adapter can
declare multiple item view types, so

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,020
it will have different
list item layouts.

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,330
For a given row in the cursor,
the forecast adapter needs to decide

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,610
if it should be a regular list item or
a today list item.

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,830
Then it will inflate, and
bind data for the appropriate layout.

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,810
We'll jump into the forecast
adapter code now to learn how to

13
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,760
handle a second item view type.

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,400
Normally, in a sub class
getViewTypeCount returns one, but

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,230
we're going to override it so it returns
two for the two different layouts.

16
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,870
But how does it know when to
use one layout, or the other?

17
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,830
Well we override getItemViewType, so
that when the position in the list is

18
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,760
zero then we say that
it's the today view type.

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,800
Otherwise, it's
the FUTURE_DAY view type.

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,280
These two view types
are declared up above.

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,760
These are just integer
representations of the view type.

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,500
The numbering has to start at 0, because
these values cannot be greater than or

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,830
equal to getViewTypeCount.

24
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,320
So the possible values for us are 0 and
1, so that we know that 0 always maps

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,610
to the view_type_today, and that one
always maps to view_type_future_day.

26
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,440
We're going to use this information
in the new view method.

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,330
Remember that previously,
we inflated the list item forecast xml.

28
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,370
Now we're going to use item view type
to determine whether we should use one

29
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,600
layout or the other.

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,710
Fill in the TODO to
address this behavior.

31
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,270
LayoutID refers to resourceID

32
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,890
which is in the form of r
dot layout dot something.
