00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Just some tactics in figuring out pains, how to rank each pain that your products

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and/or services kill, according to the intensity for the customer, and what you are looking for

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
is trying to understand--"Is this a lifesaving pain" or "Yeah, you know I'd live with this for years--

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
we could live with it for another couple of years."

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
How important is it in the list of pains that customers have in the area that you're serving.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And the other thing you want to think about is not only how intense is the pain

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
but how often does it occur.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If it occurs just once a year, people might live with it, but if it's occurring daily or hourly,

9
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
you are maybe solving something pretty important.
