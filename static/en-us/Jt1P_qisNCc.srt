1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,450
So let's look at the sizes of
some actual virtual index,

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,220
physical intact caches.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,689
While doing the previous quiz,

4
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,850
we have figured out that the cache
size needs to be less then or

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,710
equal to the associativity of
the cache times the page size.

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,030
So if we look at, for example,
the Intel Pentium 4 processor,

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:21,750
it has a four-way set associate
cache and a page size

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,020
of four kilobytes and
it's level one cache is 16 kilobytes.

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,970
The more recent Core 2,
Hehalem, Sandy Bridge, and

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,590
Haswell processors from Intel
are eight-way set associative.

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,100
Or course, they still have the four
kilobyte page size and surprise,

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,980
surprise, the level one
cache is 32 kilobytes.

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:47,880
The upcoming Skylake design from Intel
is rumored to be 16-way set associative

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:54,110
and you guessed it, it's rumored to
have a 64 kilobyte level one cache.
