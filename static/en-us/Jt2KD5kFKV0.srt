00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,560
I want to prove a point that
websites are made up of boxes.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,700
This is an example from D3.JS

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,400
Which is a popular, and powerful library
for creating graphics on the web.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,660
This Chord Diagram doesn't even
look remotely box like, yet

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,410
I promise you can find boxes.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,400
I've opened up the elements
panel in dev tools,

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,700
and by hovering over different elements,
I can see them highlighted on the page.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,250
Do you notice anything interesting?

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,800
Yep they're all boxes but take a look
at this a tag this one right here.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,370
It doesn't take up
the whole with of the page.

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,980
While this H2 tag does.

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,779
Well sort of.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,940
It takes up as much space as it can.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,190
The white space you see on
the edges is actually padding

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,930
from the parent element.

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,600
In the web dev world we say
that these elements have

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,450
different display properties
the two major options for

18
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,320
the display properties are display
block and display inline.

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,489
There are others but
they all relate back to these.

20
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,740
Mastered these two, and
you'll pick up the others, no problem.

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,260
Okay, so here I have a block element and

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,770
an inline element and
I've given both of them borders.

23
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,850
At a high level we say that block
elements take up as much width as

24
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,839
possible while inline elements
are only as wide as needed.

25
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,230
We'll cover this in more detail later.

26
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,520
So check this out.

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,539
This is a div.

28
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,388
It stands for division, and
is the most generic block on the web.

29
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:33,340
Divs are all-purpose block elements
that you'll find pretty helpful.

30
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,230
But what is this?

31
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,280
This is it's box model.
