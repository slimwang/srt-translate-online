1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,240
So, in this final sub-mar, sub-lecture about cameras,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,970
I just wanted to showcase to you the importance of different types of sensors.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,560
We discussed the photographic process that was applied to both digital and

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,960
film capture.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,523
Also discussed how sensors work in a camera.

6
00:00:17,523 --> 00:00:19,850
We looked at different types of color filters.

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,094
Talked about their filtering.

8
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:25,520
Discuss in brief CCD and CMOS sensors.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,710
And also discussed a little bit about the camera raw format.

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,510
The goal, of course, of all of this was for us to now learn as much as we could,

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,860
about what a camera is, and how rays of light are converted into pixels.

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,310
We have looked at how to do pixel-based processing before.

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,880
We know how light is captured, in this instance.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,129
So now we will take a little bit more deeper look at

15
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,596
doing computational photography.

16
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:53,589
So in the next class we

17
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:56,583
will actually get into doing some computational photography.

18
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:59,904
We'll start with learning a lot about things like blending and fading.

19
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,729
Eventually we'll come to look at things like oh,

20
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,769
how can we actually build panoramas and high-dynamic range imaging,

21
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:10,420
some of the well known examples of computational photography.

22
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,250
Of course, I'll be exploring and actually also showcasing to

23
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,070
you a wide variety of other sets of examples in the same way.

24
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,850
Again, just wanted to list a few examples of books that you could look at that

25
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:28,200
give you more details about both cameras, the processing pipeline,

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,420
and also, you know, how photography really works.

27
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,930
While this class is not really about photography, these are foundational things

28
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,330
that we will actually be playing around with a lot.

29
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,670
Again, look for additional details on the website for the class.

30
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:45,300
And remember, always have fun computing with photographs.
