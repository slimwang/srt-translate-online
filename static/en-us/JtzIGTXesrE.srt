Hi, and welcome to CS215 Social Network Analysis.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My goal in this class is to give you an introduction

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
to the analysis and design of efficient algorithms.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're going to focus on algorithms that will be useful to you

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
if you're trying to analyze large social networks.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to assume for this class that you have a familiarity with programming in Python

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and that you're comfortable with mathematical notation

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
about at the level of high school Algebra 2.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Unit 1 is going to be a bit of a warmup.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want you to think about how you design computer programs to solve particular problems.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What we're going to focus on is how we can take advantage of mathematical properties

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
of the problem that we're solving to speed things up.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm also going to introduce some social network terminology,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so that we'll be ready to dive into this topic a little bit more deeply in the later units.
