00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,510
Let me introduce to you
a concept of a bundle of rays.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,320
Okay, basically, again, remember,
what we are interested in is

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,580
rays of light that we want
to capture in a camera.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,840
Bundle of rays basically implies is
that, at any point in a scene, basically

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,570
it's a concentric set of rays of light
hitting that scene or this point.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,020
So in essence all rays of light as
converging to this specific point.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,380
In my world of course
what I have is a camera.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,210
At this point I can now
do a variety of things.

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,839
I can actually rotate this
camera just at one point.

10
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:45,870
So we can generalize this motion
by this curved arrow here.

11
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,270
So what I mean by a bundle of rays
basically now is nothing else, but

12
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,980
at this point, we are going to get
a concentric set of arrays of light.

13
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,630
And here I've just put them equidistant.

14
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,750
We just kind of show that all light
is converging at this point here.

15
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,280
And what I did by rotating
the camera at this point was try to

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,930
capture all of them.

17
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,500
Of course, you know, these rays of light
could be coming in all directions.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,070
Let's now look at a specific type of
views to help us understand this.

19
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,150
For example, this is my first view.

20
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,720
I have a subject here and
I basically use the camera here.

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,260
And basically now I get these bundle
of rays coming into my camera.

22
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,580
Of course,
I could also have another view.

23
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,660
Right?
The camera was pointing this way.

24
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,670
This is my view.

25
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,280
This is my normal from both sides here.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,170
And I now have two views.

27
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,440
So now question comes up is,
if I have these two views can I create

28
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,640
a synthetic wheel that basically
is in between both of them,

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,150
which exactly does have the same
points that I have here?

30
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,785
So this point here is also
visible in this image here.

31
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:52,695
And these points are also visible here.

32
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:57,955
So by just combining these two can I now
generate a new view, a synthetic view?

33
00:01:57,955 --> 00:02:03,135
So the belief is that it's possible
to generate any synthetic view

34
00:02:03,135 --> 00:02:07,395
of a camera as long as it has
some center of projection.

35
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:08,455
This one.

36
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:12,870
So as long as I keep my camera
at this center of projection and

37
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,760
if I do get this view and that view,
I can synthesize this one.

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,480
And this is something that's
important to note and

39
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,590
that's one of the reasons when we
talk about panoramas we want to

40
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,930
actually rotate them
around one single point.

41
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,350
Either actually have them
have a path like this or

42
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,020
just at this point rotate
our camera like this.
