1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,230
Like I said, that's the end of
the work we're going to do on

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:10,130
sort of direct motion.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,470
So basically we've looked at two
generally different ways of doing this,

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,010
of doing motion estimation
between two frames.

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,060
One can, that can handle
sort of large range sparse,

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,750
we find particular features and
we come up with descriptors.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,860
Then we find them in the, second image.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,950
We think we know which
matches are right.

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,530
We guess to see which
pairings are correct.

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,670
Look for a motion model,
and maps them across.

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,550
And that works well.

12
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,920
We can have lots of differences
between the points, but

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,020
we have to have a consistent
model across them.

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,070
And then we do that ransack thing, etc.

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,330
The other method are much more direct or
optic flow or

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,550
spatial temporal methods where pixels
may be deforming in a variety of ways.

17
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,200
We've got some patch going one way,
another patch doing another,

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,540
maybe a patch is stretching,
twisting, whatever.

19
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,820
And we're going to use the idea
that we can take spatial and

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,570
temporal derivatives in order
to tell how things are moving.

21
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,300
You know, one way of thinking about
is that the first method is good for

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,360
movement of tens of pixels, so things
move a lot and they may have changed.

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,160
So I take a picture over here and take
a picture over there of the same thing,

24
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,680
and I want to figure
out which one is which.

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,730
Okay?

26
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,050
The motion ones are better when things
are moving a small amount, you know,

27
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,040
less than ten p, a small amount of
motion, but maybe lots of frames.

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,150
So like in a movie when you see nice,
smooth motion between something,

29
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,320
that's when you would think about
the direct optical flow of methods.

30
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,360
So now you have,

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,410
sort of in your tool kit, a variety of
ways of computing motion between frames.
