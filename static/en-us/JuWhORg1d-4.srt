1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Again, pretty straight forward.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We get the word plays, and we sort them in reverse order again

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
so that bgigest are first, this time by word score, and then we just take the first n.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
By doing the subscripting like that, it works when n is too big.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It works when n equals none.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now, just an aside here, as the great American philosopher, Benjamin Parker once said,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
"With great power comes great responsibility."

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We have a great power here to go through all the words in the dictionary

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and come up with all the best plays.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now, I could read in the official Scrabble dictionary and I could apply the board position

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that you saw in my game with Ken and I could come up with a bunch of good plays.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But that wouldn't be fair to my friend Ken,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
unless we had previously agreed that it was legal and fair to do so.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not going to do that. I got to resist that temptation.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And throughout your career as an engineer,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
these types of temptations or these types of possibilities are going to come up.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Having strong ethics is part of learning to be a good software engineer.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So now, in terms of our pacing, we've achieved milestone #2.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We can stop sprinting again. We can relax. You can have a drink. We can lay down.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We can congratulate ourselves or do whatever we want to do.
