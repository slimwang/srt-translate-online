00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,450
Let's also look at examples of what happens when we change the lens that has

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,990
a different focal length.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,800
Let's look at the example we have looked at before, a tree,

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,210
a lens, an images of a lens here.

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,610
Of course, let's assume that this lens has a focal length of three inches.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,390
So this time around, I'm only going to change the lens and

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,460
give it another lens with a different focal length.

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,090
So now, we have another lens, this lens has a focal length of say six inches.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,620
Remember, we want the image to be formed, at the focal plane of this lens,

10
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,450
so now, the best image that will be formed at this focal length,

11
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,210
because of the fact that it's farther away would be larger than this one.

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,100
So just, by changing the lens focal length,

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,640
we notice that the image formed is much bigger.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,340
So this allows us to now basically be able to

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,170
control how we form images on our sensor, by changing the focal length,

16
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,280
we can actually play around and generate different types of images, and

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,788
most times, the focal length f could be longer, or shorter.

18
00:01:05,788 --> 00:01:08,830
And we will see examples of the impact of this on what kinds of

19
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,490
images are formed in a bit.

20
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,730
Now remember, focal lengths are specific to lenses themselves when they're

21
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,450
manufactured, most of times, of course, when you see complex lenses, you'll also

22
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,670
get a variety of lenses composited together and the dynamics of these lenses,

23
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,170
are the ones that give you the effective focal length of that lens.

24
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,260
In this case, of course we're just simplifying all of our lenses to

25
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,790
be just one simple lens here.
