00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] So in Laplacian smoothing we look at the relative counts.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We know there is 1 instance of rain at time 0.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Normally it would be 1.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But we add 1 to the numerator and 2 to the denominator, and we get 2/3.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's look at these numbers again.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The count that we have is 1 out of 1 is rain and 1 out of 1 would give us 1

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
under the maximum likelihood estimator.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But because we're smoothing, we're adding a pseudocount,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
which is 1 rainy day and 1 sunny day,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and we have to compensate for the 2 additional counts with a 2 over here

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and therefore we get 2/3.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So our probability under the Laplacian smoother is 2/3 for the rainy day to be the first day,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
which is really different from 1.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Applying the same logic over here, we transition 3 times out of a sunny state--

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
1, 2, 3--and each time it's a sunny state.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So maximum likelihood would say 3 times out of 3 it's sunny into sunny.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We add a pseudo observation of 1, and then there's 2 possible outcomes;

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
hence, we have to count 2 over here.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So it's 4/5.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And the missing 1/5 shows up over here.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We can do the same math as before.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Zero with 3 transitions from a sunny day resulted in a rainy day.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
In fact, they were all sunny.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But we add 1 pseudo observation over here and 2 of the normalizer, 1/5.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
These 2 things surely add up to 1.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The last one is analogous.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We have 1 transition of a rainy state and it led to a sunny state, so 1/1,

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
but we add 1 over here and 2 on the denominator so you get 2/3.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And if you do the math over here, you get 1/3.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I really want you to remember Laplacian smoothing.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's applicable to many estimation problems,

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and it will be important going forward in this class.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Here we applied it to the estimation of a Markov chain.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please take a moment and study the logic so you'll be able to apply those things again.
