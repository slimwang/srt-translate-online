1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,143
One day I woke up and
they called my co-founder and

2
00:00:05,143 --> 00:00:08,735
I told him this is not going anywhere.

3
00:00:08,735 --> 00:00:12,089
We can't work like that.

4
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:17,362
We have full time jobs,
he was working in an advertising agency.

5
00:00:17,362 --> 00:00:18,672
I was working.

6
00:00:18,672 --> 00:00:20,670
I had actually two jobs.

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,070
I was working as an analyst,
as a QA engineer.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,590
And I told them we can't do it.

9
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,650
We were doing our full time jobs.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,650
And then on the nights we're
starting this start up.

11
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,070
And we had just one guy
doing the programming.

12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,970
And we expect him to do all that work.

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,920
And this is not going anywhere.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,670
We're just entrepreneurs.

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,400
We just want to be there but
we need to commit.

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,460
We need to burn the bridges behind us.

17
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,940
And not really have Plan B.

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,160
We need to have only Plan A.

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,610
We're doing this, and no matter what.

20
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,430
And we both gave notice the same day and

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:10,850
56 days later we got our first investor.

22
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:16,570
So that was really the moment
that switched everything and

23
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:23,870
probably if we didn't just quit
our jobs and just go for it.

24
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:28,980
We probably never
completed the first version

25
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,738
because we would just like
postponing it forever.

26
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:34,550
And that fuel,

27
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:39,590
that like fire that gets you going,
that what really made a change for us.
