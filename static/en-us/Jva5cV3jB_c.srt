1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,990
Okay, this was fairly easy.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,930
When we're moving,
we know how we are moving.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,690
That is we know how our view of the
world should change with the movement.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,580
Therefore, we can take it
into account in our model.

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,570
Same goes with turning the camera.

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,150
Now, perturbations
caused by the terrain or

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,270
wind are things that we
cannot explicitly model for.

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,670
We still know that they
can affect what we see, so

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,130
it's probably a good idea to
include it in our noise model.

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,130
Known perturbations,
or control inputs or

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,840
actions, allow us to build in phenomena
that we can explicitly model for.
