00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,390
So, what happens to the neurotransmitters once they're released from the

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:09,008
synaptic vesicles? A variety of things can happen. One, those neurotransmitters

3
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:15,182
can be taken back up by that neuron. This process is called reuptake. However,

4
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:20,094
there are some groups that prevent reuptake. For example, maybe you have heard

5
00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:25,216
of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors. If someone were to take an SSRI, it

6
00:00:25,216 --> 00:00:31,360
means that once those neurotransmitters are released Into the synaptic cleft.

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,447
The drug prevents those neurotransmitters from being taken back up by that same

8
00:00:35,447 --> 00:00:40,247
neuron. That allows for more serotonin in the synaptic cleft and eventually

9
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:45,498
those serotonin neurotransmitters can attach to the receptor sites. Another

10
00:00:45,498 --> 00:00:50,546
mechanism is enzymes will actually break down those neurotransmitters. In doing

11
00:00:50,546 --> 00:00:53,876
so, they will not be able to attach to receptor sites. Once the

12
00:00:53,876 --> 00:01:00,269
neurotransmitter attaches to the receptor, it can have 1 or 2 effects.

13
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:07,220
Neurotransmitters can have an inhibitory effect or, an excitatory effect.

14
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,185
Inhibitory effect is going to decrease the likelihood of the next neuron

15
00:01:11,185 --> 00:01:16,378
firing. Whereas an excitatory effect is going to increase the likelihood of the

16
00:01:16,378 --> 00:01:18,460
next neuron firing.
