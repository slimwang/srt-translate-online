1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In TOR, to improve performance, instead of routing each packet using a new onion routing path,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
TOR sets up a circuit between two endpoints to allow further communications

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
to only require symmetric encryption operations.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And so the question is--what could go wrong?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And the options are--if the onion routers at the beginning and end of the circuit collude,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
they are able to identify the communicating endpoints by looking at the circuit identifiers.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If the onion routers at the beginning and end of the circuit collude, they may be able to identify

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
the communicating endpoints by manipulating the timing of packets in a flow.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If an onion router in the middle of the circuit is malicious, it would be able to identify

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and disrupt Alice's traffic by identifying the symmetric keys used.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And the last option--an adversary who can cause arbitrary congestion on the network

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and who knows someone is sending a steady flow of packets to endpoint B,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
may be able to identify all the onion routers in the circuit.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that apply.
