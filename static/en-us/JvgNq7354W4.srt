1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is this one.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's the probability that the message is M* divided by the number of keys.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
To see why let's think about our probability space.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We have all the possible messages being ordered.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We have message 0, message 1, all the possible messages.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There is some message that we've selected that's message M8.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We don't want to assume that the messages are uniformly distributed.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The probability that the message is M* is not necessarily

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
1 divided by the number of messages.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If the messages were uniformly distributed, then this answer would also be correct.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But they're not. We don't want to assume that.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Maybe the attacker has some prior knowledge about the distribution of the messages.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's normally the case.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Even if we don't know anything about the particular messages,

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
maybe we know it's a message in English.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Most random strings of text are not messages in English.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The other dimension in our probability space is the choice of the key.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There are K possible keys.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What we want to know is what is the intersection of these two events.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The M* even is this line in our probability space.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Each one of these keys maps exactly one message to C.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We saw that before, that there is one key that maps each message to C.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We can think of that as being a diagonal line through our probability space.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is the line where the encryption of Ki and Mi is equal to C.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Depending on what C is, it might not be a diagonal line.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But we can think of it that way, that there's one key

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
that maps each message to each cipher text.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That means there's exactly one point here where those two intersect.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If the distributions were normal, that would indeed by the correct answer.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's one point and our space is the size of M times the size of K.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But the distribution isn't normal.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We don't want to make any assumption about the distribution of M.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
For the keys we do want to assume that the distribution is normal,

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that each key is equally likely. The keys are chosen perfectly at random.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We have the probability of picking M*,

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and we're multiplying that by the probability of picking this intersecting key.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We'll call that K*.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But because the keys are uniformly distributed, we know that this probability is 1/K--

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
1 over the size of K.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We don't know that about the messages.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We leave that probability as it is.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's why this is the answer to the probability that the message M* intersected

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
with the encryption of the message is C.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now let's go back to our definition.
