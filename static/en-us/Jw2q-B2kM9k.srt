1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,942
You should be quite proud of what you have accomplished.

2
00:00:02,942 --> 00:00:08,119
Before D3 and the work of its community to replicate a map like this

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:13,210
in the browser would be quite an arduous process and require many tools, and

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:18,240
we are now done with the first step of creating our map of the World Cup games.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,070
The next step is to add some context to our map and add in the attendance data

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,610
of each of the World Cups throughout the years plotted on our map.

7
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,720
To do so,

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,140
we're going to be plotting circles on each country in which the World Cup

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,330
was held with the radius proportional to the total attendance for that year.

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:45,020
This is often referred to as thematic mapping, which refers to the fact that

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:52,070
maps with such data often represent a specific topic or, you guessed it, theme.

12
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,300
In our case, the theme will be the World Cup.

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:01,060
And thematic maps are often implemented by adding some additional context,

14
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,069
by leveraging some data plotted on the map.

15
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,800
There's a few common types of thematic maps,

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,920
many of which we have covered previously in the lessons.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,030
What we have seen previously are dot maps, which simply plot dots,

18
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:22,250
potentially of different colors in a map, and can leverage negative space.

19
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,660
Choropleth maps, which color areas such as counties,

20
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,620
states, or countries, depending on the data they represent.

21
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,710
And a cartogram which distorts area, shapes, and

22
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,780
sizes, depending on some data value.

23
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,870
And what we will be covering in this class is a graduated symbol map.

24
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:48,090
It is a symbol map because we place some symbol, in our case circles,

25
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,411
on the map and it is graduated because the area or radius,

26
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:58,010
in our case from the symbols varies depending on the data they represent.
