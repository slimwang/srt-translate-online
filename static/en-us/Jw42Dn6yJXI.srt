1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's go through them. This one has the red dot right at the beginning, and it's coming from state 0.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is a state that will occur in our chart, but it occurs in chart state 0.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Similarly, this one is coming from position 0. We've seen the a. We haven't seen the s or the b.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This one will be there, but it's in chart 1, and we're looking for things in chart 2.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
S goes to nothing from 1, and I haven't quite seen it yet.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This won't be in chart state 2 because only one input token is accounted for.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is still in chart state 1, but over here, this is looking very promising.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is saying we've just finished reducing s goes to c,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and there's one more token before this that you haven't seen.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Here, we're reducing s goes to c, and here's one token before this not currently shown.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This will be in chart state 2.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Now, these last two really test your memory of how we compute the parsing states,

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the charts, and how we keep track of this from information.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This one looks very tempting. S goes to as.b, that's definitely where we are in the input.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We're right before the b, but it says from 1.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That means there has to be one more input character that we haven't seen, x a c,

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
but that's not the input we're currently seeing.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There's no other hidden character that's not shown here.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Instead, the one we really want is as.b from 0. This is the beginning of the string.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There's an a, s goes to c. This is where we are now.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And we're hoping to see b. That's definitely in chart 2.
