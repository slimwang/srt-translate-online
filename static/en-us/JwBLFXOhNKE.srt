00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,050
all use Firefox. It is a browser. A browser

00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,190
is not an operating system. It is an application

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,080
that sits on the operating system. You may have heard

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,850
of Android. It's a system software stack that provides

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,290

00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,620
can be categorized as an operating system.
