00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,773
Here's the answer. So here's the provided code for MainDish. It has an init

2
00:00:03,773 --> 00:00:08,135
method and a str method. What we want to do with appetizer is almost the same

3
00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:12,850
thing. So let's start by cutting and pasting that code. So here's the code from

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,248
the MainDish init and we'll cut and paste that into the appetizer. And now we

5
00:00:17,248 --> 00:00:21,472
need to account for one little difference which instead of having sides, the

6
00:00:21,472 --> 00:00:25,864
appetizer has a number of people that it serves. We also need to implement the

7
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:29,698
str method for the MainDish. We're printing out the name as str if it's

8
00:00:29,698 --> 00:00:33,046
vegetarian or not. The description if it has one and the price. And you'll

9
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:35,994
notice I'm using conditional expressions here which is something you might not

10
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:39,450
of seen before. We haven't introduced it yet in this class. This is similar to

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,400
an if statement except in this case it's an expression. That means it produces a

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,492
value so we can use it in an assignment in this case giving a value to default

13
00:00:47,492 --> 00:00:52,324
parameter. And what it means is, if the value of the if test is true, the value

14
00:00:52,324 --> 00:00:56,780
of expression is what we put before the if. Otherwise it's what we put after the

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,240
else. So in this case we'll get the star if self dot vegetarian is true.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,770
Otherwise we'll get nothing. This is what we did to implement str for the

17
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,478
MainDish. For the str function we want to do exactly the same thing for

18
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:11,169
appetizer as we did for MainDish, so we can cut and paste this code.
