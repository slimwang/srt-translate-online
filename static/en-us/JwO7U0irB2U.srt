[Evans] So now the question is, how much harder does the addition of salt make it

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
for an attacker who wants to carry out offline dictionary attacks?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That means the attacker can pre-compute a dictionary of encrypted passwords

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and then for each collected password file wants to find any passwords

5
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that match the values found in that dictionary.
