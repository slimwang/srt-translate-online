1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is the 4th choice.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If she can find 2 keys where either the encryption of 0 with key 0

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
is equal to the encryption of 1 with key 1 or the opposite,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
then at least half the time she has an advantage.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So in this case, if she sends this as the message, if Bob guesses 0, she can win

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
by revealing K1.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If Bob guesses 1, she can win by revealing K0, so she's guaranteed to win.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If she finds a key pair like this, well, then she can do the same thing.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
She can reveal this is the message and then based on Bob's guess,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
reveal wither K1 or K0.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Either of these would also allow her to cheat if she could find a key that has this property--

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
that for whatever key she happened to pick, encrypt 0 to the same thing that key encrypted 1 to,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
well, that would allow her to cheat just as well.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But this is a harder thing to do than finding 2 keys that have this property.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We might not know enough yet to be able to be sure that this is harder than that,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
but we know it certainly is no more difficult and this could be easier,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and we'll see that, in fact, it is easier.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The second one would also be enough, but this is the much stronger property

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
to find a key pair that has both of those properties.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
How hard this is depends on lots of things.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The first thing we have to answer a little more is what encryption means here.
