1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,410
The first worm was designed by Robert Morris, Jr. in 1988. The worm

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:12,290
itself had no malicious payload but, it ended up bogging down the machines that

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,530
it infected by spawning new processes

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,430
uncontrollably and exhausting resources. And at the

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:26,020
time it was released, it affect ten percent of all Internet hosts. It spread,

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,620
through three different propagation vectors. The worm

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,570
tried to crack passwords ,using a small dictionary

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,420
and a publicly readable password file and also

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,100
targeted hosts. That were already listed in a

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,510
trusted host file, on the machine that was

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,210
already infected. This ability to perform remote execution

12
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,125
was one way, that the worm was allowed to spread. The second way that it spread

13
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:57,540
,was in a buffer overflow vulnerability, In the finger demon. This was a

14
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,920
standard buffer overflow exploid. And ,if you

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,700
don't know about buffer overflows, I would

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:08,570
urge you to take a computer security coarse. But essentially, this is a

17
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,220
very common attack that makes remote exploits

18
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,135
possible, effectively resulting in the ability to

19
00:01:16,135 --> 00:01:19,350
run arbitrary code. At the root level

20
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,070
privilege. The third way that worm spread, was

21
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,510
via the debug command in send mail, which

22
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,024
is a mail sending service. In early send

23
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:30,230
mail versions, it was possible to execute a

24
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,160
command on a remote machine by sending an

25
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,250
SMTP message. The worm used this, capability to

26
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,620
spread automatically. A key theme that we'll see

27
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,860
In the design of other worms, is this

28
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,750
use of multiple vectors. Now any particular worm,

29
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,330
may end up using, a different set of

30
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,670
vectors depending on the remote vulnerabilities that it's trying

31
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,340
to exploit. But the idea that any worm

32
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,190
should be able to exploit multiple weaknesses in a

33
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,910
system gives it more ways to spread. And

34
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,430
often also speeds up the propagation of the worm.

35
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,008
This worm design also followed the following

36
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:11,820
general approach, which we see showing up over

37
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,490
and over again in worm designs. First, the

38
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,710
worm needs to scan other hosts to find

39
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,750
potentially vulnerable hosts. In the second step, it

40
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,340
needs to spread. By infecting, other vulnerable hosts.

41
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,590
And in the third step, it needs to

42
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,530
remain undiscoverable and undiscovered so that it can

43
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,080
continue to operate and spread without being removed from systems.
