1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,340
So far we are focused largely
on message confidentiality.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,500
What if we want to protect
message integrity.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,120
That is, we want to prevent or

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,700
detect any unauthorized
modification to the message.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,130
One standard approach is to
send the last block of CBC,

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,280
also called a CBC residue,
along with a plain text.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,450
Now, if an attacker
intercepts the message and

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:30,160
modify the plain text, the attacker
does not have the correct key, therefore

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,130
he cannot compute a correct CBC
residue with the modified plain text.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,600
So he's forced to resend the modified
plain text with original CBC residue.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,640
The CBC residue that the receiver
computes on the modified plaintext

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,010
will not be the same as the CBC
residue that he receives.

13
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,940
Therefore, the receiver would know
that the plaintext has been modified.

14
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:00,270
In other words, the CBC residue provides
a protection of message integrity.
