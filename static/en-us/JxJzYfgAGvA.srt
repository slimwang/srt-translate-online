1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,210
Let's give this testing thing a try.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,100
We've provided an exercise in the course
code with a simple project, and

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,689
a couple of unit tests.

4
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:08,930
Set up and run the tests,
and when you're done,

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,930
describe in plain English what was wrong
with the class that was failing a test.
