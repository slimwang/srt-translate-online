1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,375
So we knew from day one when we launched
the service we were going to charge,

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:05,530
so there was going to be
paid plans on the service.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,430
We saw no reason why we should
start off with a free plan.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,310
We were like, this is going to be
a business that makes money, and

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,600
in 2006 that was not vogue at the time.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,570
Quite honestly a lot of people
were like, build it for free,

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,620
get a bunch of users, and
figure out how to monetize later.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,270
And we were just like, I don't know.

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,050
It seems like we can monetize right now.

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:26,860
Why don't we go ahead and

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,790
start that and then we don't have
to worry about the weirdness of?

12
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,521
Like, it's easier to give more stuff for

13
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:33,900
free than than it is to start
charging stuff for later on.

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,570
It's the way we thought about it.

15
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,386
And so, when we did YC, we had not
written any lines of code, and

16
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:41,744
we started in the January of 2006.

17
00:00:41,744 --> 00:00:45,190
And that's when we first started
writing and programming WuFu.

18
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,390
And then we had an interface prototype
in February, so in about a month.

19
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,740
And that interface prototype
allows you to see how a new way of

20
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,550
building forms and designing them,
but it didn't hook up to a database,

21
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,270
you couldn't save it,
you couldn't collect information.

22
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,900
But it allowed people to see, like
this is a better way of doing things,

23
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,640
better than what you would see,
say, from Microsoft InfoPath or

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,730
other form builders out there.

25
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,530
And we said like we should ship this.

26
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,096
Right, like see what people say,
basically do that step of talking users,

27
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:11,900
getting engagement, and
get people excited about it.

28
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,308
And so
we released an interface preview demo.

29
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:18,084
And that demo, at the end of it you
create and design the form, and

30
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:22,070
when you hit the save,
it says thanks for trying out the demo.

31
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,890
When you want to know when we finally
launch, give us your email address.

32
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,287
And we got over 100,000 people
to go through that demo, so

33
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:32,930
that when we'd launch we'd be able
to start off up front off of it.

34
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,940
But, the thing is, part of that idea
also, again, came from Joe Kraus

35
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,890
surprisingly at the time, where he
talks about like a lot of companies,

36
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,450
what they don't realize is that they
should not just beta test their product,

37
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,290
but beta test their pricing.

38
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,790
Right, their paid upgrade and
conversion triggers.

39
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,680
And you're never going to know that
until you finally put a price up there

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,440
and put a button that says you
can't do this until you pay.

41
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,630
And so like a lot of that
just resonated with us.

42
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,220
We were like, this company needs to be
something that stands on its own, and

43
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,070
I guess you could say we were the kind
of founders that didn't have the risk

44
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,660
profile that, say, like, we're going to
take the risk on like, giving tons of

45
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,258
things for free, try to figure out how
to scale, and eventually monetize.

46
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,860
To us, it was like, this is either
going to be something people pay for,

47
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,382
or it's not.

48
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:20,670
And I think for 99% of BDB sort of
companies and services, it's easy to do.

49
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,270
I think I meet a lot of founders
who think I'm building something,

50
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,190
it's better than the competition,
it's easier to use, it's faster, and

51
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,730
then I'm going to charge a whole lot
less for it, and I think that's usually

52
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,150
a mistake that people have, or I'm just
going to give it all away for free.

53
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,031
That's just like, that's where you're
losing out on a lot of opportunity and

54
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:37,850
economics for stuff.
