00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,030
With our previous model view octopus organizational pattern,

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,890
to make a number in the model, we would literally say var myNum equals 5.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,647
How would you make a variable in the model to store a number with Knockout?

4
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:17,935
Go ahead and use an observable, and set the number to an initial value of 5.
