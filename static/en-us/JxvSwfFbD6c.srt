1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,140
Service workers will handle any
page that falls within their scope.

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:11,170
This one is served by the service worker
because it falls within the scope.

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,530
Chocolate isn't candy.

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,800
It's a nutrient.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,900
So this one,
not surfed by a service worker.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,020
Milk chocolate is
technically a chocolate but,

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,480
it's not served over https.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,810
So, it's not surfed by
the service worker.

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:34,150
And finally, this last one is
surfed by the service worker

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,590
even though it's several levels deep, it
still falls under the chocolate scope.
