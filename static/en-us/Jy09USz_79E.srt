00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,070
So how would you use explanation based learning to implement an agent to

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,850
can solve Raven,s progressive matrices? The first question you're asking here is

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,450
what exactly are you explaining? Are you explaining the answer to the problem,

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,810
or are you explaining the transformations between figures in the earlier stages

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,970
of the problem? Given that, what new connections are you learning,

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,650
Is it learning performed within the problem or

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,410
old connections an justify the figure to fill in the blank, or

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,070
to perform the cross problems, where new transmissions and

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,980
types of problems can be learned and connected together.

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,852
For example you might imagine that you've encountered two problems before,

11
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:34,770
one are rotation and one are reflection. A new problem might involve both,

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,800
how do you use those earlier problems to explain the answer to this new problem?
