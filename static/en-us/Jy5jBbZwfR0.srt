00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,180
So take a moment now to get the SHA1
fingerprint from your debug certificate.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,029
Remember, you're going to have to
find your .android directory for

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:08,680
your platform.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,820
And then you're going to
run the keytool command.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,158
And the keytool command is run
with the following parameters.

6
00:00:14,158 --> 00:00:20,890
-list, -v, -keystore, with the location
of your keystore that you found.

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,850
It may change based on
your operating system.

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,010
You saw how I did it for the Mac.

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,940
-Alias android debug key -storepass
android,-keypass android.

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,350
Once you've run this,
take a look at your SHA1 key and

11
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,620
make sure you make a copy of it or
leave your terminal window open.

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,160
When you're done, check this box.
