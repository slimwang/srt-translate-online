1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's my solution.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I've got to say that my solution came out a little bit more complicated than I expected it to.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I think maybe I made a bad choice for the representation.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I threw in the flashlight along with the set of people,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
because I figured you want one set to represent everything that's on one side.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But I'm think now after this came out the way that it did

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that maybe I should have had the flashlight be a separate part of the state.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In other words, have the state be a 4-tuple, not of things that are here or there

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
but of people that are here or there, then the time,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and then a fourth element being the flashlight saying where is the flashlight.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That could either be true or false, saying it is it here,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
or it could be a character string, saying it's there or here,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
or it could be a integer--0 or 1.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I think it might've been easier if I'd chosen one of those representations.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But it didn't bother me enough to go back and make a change.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you want to, you could spend time refractoring and change that.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm going to just push ahead. Here's what I did.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I said if the light is here, then let's look at all the people in here.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We'll look at all the pairs of people--A and B.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
To make sure that they're people, I have to say that they're not the light.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
For all pairs of people A and B,

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
we can generate a successor state,

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
which is the set of people that were here

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
minus the two people and the light, because the light is going to move from here to there.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The second part of the successor state is everything

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
that was already over on the other side on there

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
unioned with the things that are coming over,

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
which are people A and B and the light.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Then the time is the time plus the maximum time that it took for A and B to get over.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Then I know it says in the specification here that the action is represented just by an arrow.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
If I want to get the problem right I would do that, but then I decided

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
later on that maybe the action should be more than just the arrow.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Maybe the action should also tell who went across.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I have the option of doing thing.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If I want to just solve the problem the way it was specified

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
then I would return just the arrow to represent the action,

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and I would do the same thing over here.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
One subtlety of this that worked out well in my favor--

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
it's a little bit messy dealing with frozen sets.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't like the idea of that the name is so long,

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
but I didn't have to consider separately the idea of one person going across

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and two persons going across.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Because we were dealing with sets, the set of people a, b when a is equal to b is equal to 1 person.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I get the 1 person crossing for free. That's one nice thing about my representation.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But notice that everything is in flux here.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm trying to choose a good representation.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm changing my mind as I go along.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Should the actions be represented by a single arrow or should they be

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
represented by an arrow along with the names of the people that are going?

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's all up in flux.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I should say that that type of flux is okay as long as it remains contained.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If you have uncertainties that are going to cross barriers

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
between lots of different functions, then probably you want to nail them down.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
If you think that they're contained, then it's okay to have some uncertainty

55
00:03:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and be able to explore the exact options later.
