1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,520
So the specific objectives
of this lesson are for

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,740
us to dive deeper into the Harris
corner detector algorithm.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,690
Now, we have already
looked at it briefly.

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,570
Here we are going to talk about
the various steps that go into making

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,570
the Harris corner detector algorithm,
and

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,390
also look at a variety of differences
and variants on the basic algorithm,

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,570
that'll help us understand how
we can do feature detection.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,730
In addition, I will also describe
the more widely used SIFT algorithm,

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,370
which is actually pretty much used on
most softwares that actually do any kind

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,230
of feature deduction and matching.

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,490
Just to recall, our goal is to
start off with two images and

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,740
our interest is to find features
in these images, like these.

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,370
And then also, find features in
another image in an image pair.

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,501
And then match them, saying this
is the same feature as that one.

15
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:50,010
So finding the similar features
across two images is our goal.

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,120
And to do this, we have been spending
a lot of time, actually from

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,090
the earliest lectures, trying to
learn how we can get inside and

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,510
find repeatable features
that actually can be

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,410
detected more reliably across images,
even though the images might be changed.

20
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,560
In this case, the change is subtle.

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,360
Just a pan from one view to the other.
