00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:10,466
And the answers are 0.2 and 0.6. If you look at this table carefully, you find that B doesn't really depend on whether A is true or false.

2
00:00:10,467 --> 00:00:18,566
In both cases it's 0.2. So you can sum this as p of B equals 0.2, which is equivalent to the network of the following type.

3
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:26,866
That's actually a legal representation because arcs may fail to render dependencies, and nothing in base level land

4
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:33,332
just prescribes that an arc must yield different probabilities depending on the variabilities into the arc.

5
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:41,699
This is, of course, a more compact representation, at which point you see that p of B given C is obviously just p of B, 0.2.

6
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,699
And p of C given B is now obtained by total probability.

7
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,899
P of C given B is the same as p of C, because B has no impact on C anymore.

8
00:00:50,900 --> 00:01:00,332
And that can be factored into p of C given A, times p of A, plus p of C given not A, times p of A, times p of not A.

9
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:10,667
And if you plug all these things in, this p of A and p of not A equals 0.5, and then we get just the mean between 0.8 and 0.4, which is 0.6.
