00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,475
Congratulations. You've made it to the end of lesson one.

2
00:00:02,475 --> 00:00:04,555
>> Believe it or not, you've learned a lot already.

3
00:00:04,555 --> 00:00:07,890
>> You've learned about the tools that you use to write programs, and you've

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:08,855
written your first program.

5
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:12,160
>> You've also learned how to structure your thoughts. So you can write pseudocode

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,800
and algorithms that a computer can understand. You now speak the basics of the

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,504
secret language.

8
00:00:16,504 --> 00:00:20,400
>> In the next lesson you'll learn how to write interesting programs with

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,350
pictures, text and dates.

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,019
>> Not those kinds of dates. We look forward to seeing you there.
