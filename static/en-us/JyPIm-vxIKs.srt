Hi and welcome to Inferential Statistics. This course builds

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,830
on the skills you previously learned in Descriptive Statistics. Now

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,140
if you haven't taken Descriptive Stats yet, feel free

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,610
to follow the link in the instructor's notes box to

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,570
our descriptive stats class. Statistician John Tukey said an

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,620
approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,250
deal more than the exact answer to an approximate problem.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,188
Now in this course you will learn to apply statistics

9
00:00:26,188 --> 00:00:30,529
to find these approximate answers, make predictions about data, as well as

10
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:33,597
run tests to verify the accuracy of a model. And for your

11
00:00:33,597 --> 00:00:36,864
final project, you will get the chance to make your own predictions

12
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,790
on a data set. So, let's go to Katie Kormanik to get started
