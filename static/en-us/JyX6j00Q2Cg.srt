1
00:00:00,178 --> 00:00:02,810
Okay, so let's familiarize ourselves with this dataset a little bit

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,770
more, and what I really mean here is lets get a little

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,210
bit better understanding of the OpenStreetMap project itself and

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,830
get started learning what we need to know in order to do

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,350
this particular case study. Okay, so I'm actually going to go

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,140
ahead and submit a search for Chicago to OpenStreetMap and

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,430
you'll see that I get a number of different results here.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,220
The one I'm interested in is this one, the city boundary of

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,220
Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, United States of America. Doing this is

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,750
essentially going to select from the OpenStreetMap data set,

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,670
just that data that has to do with the city of

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,690
Chicago. So I'm going to click through to this and you can

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,550
see the outline here that identifies the city boundary. And so,

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,510
the data that I would be working with is anything that falls

15
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,300
in here. So now if I click export, what's going to happen

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,190
is that I'll see the latitude longitude and it's going to tell me,

17
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,590
this is too large to be exported. Okay but

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,800
then, if I scroll down, I can see that there

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,700
are actually already prepared extracts from this data set. Okay,

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,210
so let me make this a little bit bigger. Now

21
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,390
what this is, is pre-prepared extracts from this particular

22
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,290
data set and these are extracts for major metropolitan areas.

23
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,510
So, you can see I've actually clicked on Chicago link

24
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,771
before. I'm going to go ahead and click on that and

25
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:20,570
then here I have an opportunity to download a zipped up version of this OSM data

26
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,810
as XML. So I click on that and

27
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,450
it begins downloading. And once it's done downloading, then

28
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,700
we can go ahead and take a look at it. Alright, this data is downloaded, I

29
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,420
am going to take a look at it.

30
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,850
It's in my downloads directory. I've already unzipped it,

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,340
and here it is. Lots and lots and lots of

32
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,160
XML data. This should look somewhat familiar to you. We've seen

33
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,750
these note tags before and we've actually extracted a little data

34
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,590
from this data set previously. Okay, I'm going to use the

35
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,100
shell command LS, see what the size of this dataset is.

36
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,340
You can see here that it's about 1.8 gigabytes. So, this

37
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,130
is a huge dataset. What this means is that in order

38
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,160
to process this data, we can't really read it into memory.

39
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,430
And so as you'll see a little bit later on, we're going to

40
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,130
use an approach to parsing this that uses a SAX parser, which we did

41
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,930
look at a little bit in a previous lesson. Okay so now, what I

42
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,350
usually do in a situation like this is I explore the data itself a

43
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,600
little bit. I might even write a little code to parse out a

44
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,580
little of what's here just so I can get a feel for it. The

45
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,660
next thing then that we'll want to do is to read enough documentation to

46
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,110
answer any questions that we have or at least enough to get us started.

47
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,470
Okay so what I'm going to do here, then, is simply query for

48
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,010
OpenStreetMap documentation and I can see that there's actually a

49
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,020
Wiki for OpenStreetMap. So if I click through to that,

50
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,670
I land on the Wiki page which gives me quite a bit

51
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,480
of information about OpenStreetMap. Now I'm going to make this ridiculously

52
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,020
big so that you can see it on your screen. And if

53
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,350
we scroll down, you can see there's a lot to read here.

54
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:53,430
So you can see there's a beginners guide, information for developers, and other

55
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,320
pieces of information - map features, that sort of thing.

56
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,990
I know from having looked at this page before that there's

57
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,720
actually documentation on the XML format which is going to

58
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,710
be useful to us as we move forward. This provides an

59
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,730
example of the different sorts of tags that you're going to

60
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,730
see in this data set and a little bit of an

61
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,390
explanation about it. For example, we can see from this documentation

62
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:18,980
that this data is essentially instances of 3 different data primitives.

63
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,590
Data primitives being nodes, ways, and relations and

64
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,560
if we click through to any one of

65
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,640
these, we'll get a little bit more information

66
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,960
about them, okay? So I encourage you to take

67
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,040
a look at this documentation for yourself. Make

68
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,020
sure you understand nodes, ways and relations and

69
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,640
you'll be in good shape to more on. Just do a little bit of reading for now.
