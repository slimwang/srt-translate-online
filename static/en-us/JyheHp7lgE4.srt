00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,740
Let me show you an example of
the Lytro Light Field camera.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,660
Here, basically, if you see,

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,710
you know, I can focus by
clicking on different regions.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,250
In essence, what this camera does,

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,860
it captures a stack of images
at different focal lengths.

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,470
And interactively, you can choose which
focal plane you want to visualize.

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,360
So, in essence, what it does is actually
to some extent it's learned photography.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,830
Here you can even see parallax, right?

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,800
I'm just moving it, and you can see
a little bit of depth going on.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,000
Again, is happening between the uv,
and the sd planes.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,700
Again, by using the microlens length
arrays, they were able to capture a lot

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,500
of images, and now this is basically
interpolating between all of them to

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,340
give you both depth parallax issues,
and also focal planes.

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,900
Again, when we talked about
the photography we look at this whole

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,657
concept, right?

16
00:00:48,657 --> 00:00:53,110
A photography said, find a bunch of
images that are just different by a bit,

17
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,900
and now, we can actually bring those
images to create a representation.

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,780
In this case,
they're using it to create a light field

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,250
by putting in a smaller micro-cameras
with a bigger camera system.

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,890
More information,
we capture it each and every pixel.

21
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,520
Then, of course,

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,180
we can actually generate more newer
forms of pixels after their captured.

23
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,410
So, that, in a sense,
is the idea of doing all of this.
