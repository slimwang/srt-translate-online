To have connection callbacks and to be
able to handle connection failed events,

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,520
what do you add to your public class
MainActivity extends ActionBarActivity?

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,110
Do you add the first line where you say
you implement ConnectionCallbacks and

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,980
you implement
OnConnectionFailedListener?

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,890
Do you add the second line where you say
it implements ConnectionCallbacks and

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,150
OnConnectionFailedListener?

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,820
Do you pick the third line where you
say adds ConnectionCallbacks and

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,060
OnConnectionFailedListener?

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,840
Or do you do nothing, it works already.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,840
Check the box that you think
is the correct answer.
