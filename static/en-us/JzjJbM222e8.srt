00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,910
In this lesson we explained what is
virtualization, and what are some of

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,240
the main approaches that are used
to virtualize physical platforms.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,980
We specifically described mechanisms for
processor and memory, or

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,670
device virtualization that either were
or still are part of the dominant

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,440
virtualization solutions, such as
Zen and KVM or the VM Ware products.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,420
In addition, we discussed some of
the hardware advances that have occurred

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,690
as a result of the need to efficiently
virtualize the popular x86 platform.
