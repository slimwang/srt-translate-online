1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,190
So, what we want to do is, we want to figure out,

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:09,490
we want to model how this error function changes for small shifts.

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,760
So we're not going to move you of 97 pixels.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,680
No we're going to move, maybe even just a fraction of a pixel or a,

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,340
or a small shift.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,990
Right near u and v being zero zero, that is around no shift at all.

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,430
And of course what we'd like to see is that we get a significant change even for

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,830
a small shift that would tell us no matter how we move in u and v,

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,720
and that would tell us that this image is going to change as I move around, and

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,730
maybe it's corner-like.

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,430
So how do you predict the value of a function for small shifts?

12
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,510
Do you remember this?

13
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,920
Do you remember this?

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,860
Oh yeah, calculus.

15
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,010
Taylor expansions?

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,010
All right.

17
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:53,990
We're going to do a second order Taylor expansion of E of u v.

18
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,660
That's our function here.

19
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,374
Around u and v being zero zero.

20
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,519
And this second order means it's going to be a small, a quadratic approximation.

21
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,600
All right, so strap in, because we're going to go through the math of

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,820
doing that, and it'll get us to a point where it's very easy to

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,490
compute whether the neighborhood around a point feels corner like.

24
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,410
All right, so you may not remember everything you need to know about Taylor

25
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,370
expansions, so I'm going to write this out.

26
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:26,480
So back when you first took calculus, this was the equation of a Taylor

27
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:34,550
approximation, where we say that the value of a function of some small delta

28
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:40,380
near zero can be approximated the value at zero times the first derivative

29
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,740
times delta x times the second derivative of delta squared x half of that.

30
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,700
That was the Taylor approximation.

31
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,020
I'm sure you all have that tattooed somewhere on your body.

32
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,100
All right.

33
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,450
So it gets a little uglier when we do things in two dimensions.

34
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,749
Remember it's u and v.

35
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:56,650
Okay?

36
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,378
And we're going to write that out for

37
00:01:58,378 --> 00:02:01,070
this expression, this error of u v function, this way.

38
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,270
You ready?

39
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,020
Okay, don't panic.

40
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,210
What we're saying is, that the error function u v for some small uv's near zero,

41
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,890
can be approximated by the value at zero zero.

42
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:20,970
The first derivative times the u v, so

43
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,220
that's like this d f of x times delta x, except now we got it in two dimensions.

44
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,210
So we've got the gradient and

45
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,410
the u dimensions, plus the gradient of the v dimension.

46
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,900
Plus, we have this quadratic term and

47
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,100
in vector notation for two dimensions, that quadratic term is written like this.

48
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,810
So these are our second derivatives.

49
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:46,140
Uu vv, this is uv uv, and we just matrix multiply times the uv vector.

50
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,680
Hopefully this is somewhat familiar to you from your vector calculus if not,

51
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,460
it's just true
