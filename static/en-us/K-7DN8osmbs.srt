00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,530
So let's get started using Pointer Events. To use the

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,190
polyfill, you just need to include the library in your project.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,820
Or if you are already using polymer, you don't need to

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,630
do that. I am in my synthesizer app, so I don't

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,280
need to include anything else. Then, for each element that you

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,521
want to get Pointer Events, you need to add a touch-action

7
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:22,500
attribute. This let's the system know that you want to consume

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,780
the events rather than having them use to do default actions

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,500
like scrolling.
