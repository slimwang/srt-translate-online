00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,865
At this point, we want to start translating the equation we just came up with

2
00:00:03,877 --> 00:00:07,950
into more traditional Math language. As a reminder, here is the information, up

3
00:00:07,962 --> 00:00:11,890
here at the top, that we decided before was going to be useful for us. And down

4
00:00:11,902 --> 00:00:15,860
here is that word equation that you came up with in the last quiz. We have three

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:19,700
quantities related to one another in this equation, and I would like to know

6
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,620
right now which one of these you think we need to represent with a variable for

7
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:24,832
the purposes of solving this problem.
