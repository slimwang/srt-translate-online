1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,680
Now you can see how we apply these rules of inferences on sentences in

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,060
a knowledge base or philosophical agent to prove all kinds of sentences. See,

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,250
imagine that an AI agent begins with the knowledge that if an animal has

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,880
feathers, it implies that the animal is a bird. Now it comes across Harry,

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,890
who does have feathers. By Modus Ponens,

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,500
therefore the AI agent can conclude that Harry is a bird.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,780
This completes the proof for our original goal of proving that Harry is a bird.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,400
Now let us suppose that a goal is to prove that Buzz does not have feathers.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,980
Once again, imagine an AI agent which begins with the knowledge that if

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,000
an animal has feathers, it implies that the animal has, is a bird.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,530
The agent comes across a animal, which is not a bird. Then by Modus Tollens

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,920
it can infer that buzz must not have feathers. This completes the proof for

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,110
of a original goal of proving that buzz does not have feathers. Okay. So

14
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:03,600
now, we have looked at two ways of proving the truth value of various sentences.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,650
The first way was just through truth tables. I could have sentences and

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,740
logic. Then I could write another sentence. And ask myself, what,

17
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,481
what is the truth value of this sentence? I could construct a truth table for

18
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:18,743
that sentence, composed of the truth values of all the predicates,

19
00:01:18,743 --> 00:01:22,760
with some of which might be coming from earlier sentences. The second way in

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,314
which we have seen how we can prove the truth values of sentences and

21
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:29,510
logic is by applying these rules of inferences like modus ponens and

22
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:34,190
modus tollens. This is very powerful, and in fact the power of this logic has

23
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:38,875
been known since before the birth of AI. As computer scientists however,

24
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:42,958
we'll analyze this power in a slightly different way. Yes, we can use method of

25
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:47,960
truth tables to construct a truth table for any arbitrary sentence. However,

26
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,640
the sentence was complicated. Then the truth table very soon will become very

27
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,570
complex. Computationally, that is infeasible for very long,

28
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,570
large sentences. Similarly, yes we can apply simply modus ponens and

29
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,920
modus tollens to find the truth value of many sentences. But if the knowledge

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,560
base consisted of a very large number of sentences, instead of just one or

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,410
two sentences, then the kinds of inferences, number of inferences I

32
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,140
can draw from those sentences simply by applying modus ponens and modus tollens,

33
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,010
will be very large. Or if I had to find the truth value of a single sentence,

34
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,790
then the different pathways I could take in order to get to the truth value of

35
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,170
those sentences can make for long, large problem space. So while these

36
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,840
methods of proving the truth with your sentences and logic have been around for

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,480
a long time. These methods are not computationally feasible. At least not for

38
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,470
complex tasks. At least not for agents that have only limited computational

39
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,900
resources and from who we want near realtime performance
