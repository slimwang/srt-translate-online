1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,710
The best way to get used to the shell is
to try a bunch of things out in it and

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,620
see what happens.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,558
So here's a bunch of things to try.

4
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,300
In each case, run the command and
see what you get.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,390
And then in your own words,
write down what you believe it's doing.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,600
Something to notice is that while
some commands are just one word,

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,100
others have more information
that follows the command name.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,270
These are called Command Line Arguments.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,163
And they're input that you provide
to a particular command or

10
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,338
program when you run it.

11
00:00:30,338 --> 00:00:35,120
The command name is just
the first word like expr or host.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,240
And the arguments make up
the rest of the command line.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,030
So now, try each one of these
commands in your shell.

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,860
And in the box underneath each command,

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,540
write what that command
seems to be doing.
