00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,430
Cool coffee beans,
you've made your first app, but

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,620
don't take my word for it.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,580
Make sure that it runs on your phone.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,990
So now I've taken you through three
steps to show you how to take a drawing

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,420
to an app.

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,950
Let's recap a little.

7
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,010
The first step was to choose your views.

8
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,360
A great place to start with this step
is to circle the different views.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,470
And then decide which view
tags you need to use.

10
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,930
Katebin Kanal taught you about two
view tags, imagery and text views.

11
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,610
And they also mentioned
a view called a button,

12
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,760
which we'll be using in the next lesson.

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,100
As you begin to feel
a little bit more ambitious,

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,222
you can discover new views
in the documentation.

15
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:38,880
All right once you're done choosing
your view, you move on to positioning.

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,690
And the question you need to be
asking yourself at this stage is what

17
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,390
view group should I use.

18
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,780
Now, view groups have a lot
of control over how and

19
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,010
where you position your views.

20
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,650
If the views are aligned horizontally or
vertically,

21
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,120
you probably want to
use a linear layout.

22
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,240
And if the views are aligned
relative to one another,

23
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,450
then you probably want to
use a relative layout.

24
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,220
Now once you're made this decision,
if you're using a linear layout,

25
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,720
you're going to think about things
like orientation and layout weight.

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,030
Layout weight in particular is a little
bit complicated but pretty powerful.

27
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,210
It allows you to sort of equally
distribute your views across the screen

28
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,130
which is a really great feature.

29
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,505
If you're using a relative layout,

30
00:01:15,505 --> 00:01:18,430
you'll will be thinking of how to
position your views relative to their

31
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,000
sibling views, and to their parent view.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,770
Now, this will be done using
the align parent attributes, and

33
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,630
attributes like to left of and
to right of.

34
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,180
Step three is the fun step,
where you get to style your views.

35
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,410
During this step you'll look at things
like the text, and the color, and

36
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,560
the font, and
decide what you want them to look like.

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,920
Will the text have a background color,

38
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,620
how will the pictures
fill up their space?

39
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,290
Once you know the attributes
you're going to change,

40
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,170
then you need to now the correct
value you're going to change them to.

41
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,350
Finally, you'll look at the more subtle
spacing issues between elements.

42
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,220
And you can tweak the spacing
between elements using padding and

43
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,390
layout margin attributes.

44
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,890
Once you're able to master these steps,
you should be able to take any

45
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,700
simple drawing that you come up with,
and turn it into an Android app layout.

46
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,340
Good work.
