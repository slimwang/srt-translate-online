1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,940
Now let's do an example.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:06,740
So here's your reminder of the formula and suppose this is my data.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,040
I have four data points and for each data point I have three features,

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,570
the grade of the train, the bumpiness, whether there's a speed limit,

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,709
and then the speed that the car goes.

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,440
And i'm just making up some data here.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,890
So let's start out at the top of the decision tree here.

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,960
So I have two slow examples and two fast examples.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,200
Slow, slow, fast, fast.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,199
So the first question is, what's the entropy of this node?

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,590
So let's do this piece by piece.

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,880
How many of the examples in this node are slow?

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,810
Write your answer here.
