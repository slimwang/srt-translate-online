00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,819
What we're doing is compacting the items that have a 0 as the least significant bit.

2
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:09,187
So if you recall, when we compact what we need to do is have a predicate

3
00:00:09,187 --> 00:00:14,015
that are going to tell us which of these input elements to keep.

4
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:17,227
So if we call each of these elements an unsigned integer

5
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:19,565
and that unsigned integer is named i,

6
00:00:19,565 --> 00:00:25,336
what is the predicate on each one of these integers that is going to allow us to return true

7
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:27,942
only for this set of integers?

8
00:00:27,942 --> 00:00:32,011
So write this in this box in the C programming language, please.
