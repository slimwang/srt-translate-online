00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
All right. Welcome to the final exam.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,850
Let's go ahead and start off with some questions about P vs NP.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:12,020
So, I'd like you to check the boxes here for the statements that you think are true.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:18,960
First, if any problem in NP is polynomial-time solvable, then P = NP.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,220
The second question is if any problem in NP provably requires

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,130
exponential time to solve, then P ≠ NP.

7
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:33,790
And finally, if P ≠ NP, then some problems solvable in polynomial time

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,810
on a nondeterministic RAM will require exponential time to solve on a deterministic RAM.

9
00:00:38,810 --> 99:59:59,999
So, please check all that are true.
