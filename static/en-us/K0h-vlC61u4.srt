00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,117
The answer is that all of these curves over here are functions, except for curve

2
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:08,175
D. That's this light blue one right here. And we can see, that right here

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:13,321
between 0 and looks like about 4, if we put a vertical line in that region the

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:18,226
curve that intersect that line at more than one point. That means there are

5
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:22,646
certain inputs, or certain x values, on this curve for which there is more than

6
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:26,376
one y value, so this is not a function. All the other ones are however,

7
00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:30,336
including another graph unlike anything you've seen, this graph E right here,

8
00:00:30,336 --> 00:00:33,342
this is just proof that there is always more to learn in math.
