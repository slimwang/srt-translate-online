00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,630
Welcome to the classroom.

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:04,600
For your first project you'll build
a simple app to highlight information

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,670
about your favorite coffee shop,
athletic store, or other small business.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,590
To learn the skills needed to build this
app, we've curated a few lessons for

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,530
you in the lesson section
below your project.

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,782
In those lessons, you'll join Katherine
and our dear colleague Kunal and

7
00:00:17,782 --> 00:00:22,530
get hands-on experience displaying
text and images to a device's screen.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,209
This is one of the most popular classes
on Udacity with over 100,000 students.

9
00:00:27,209 --> 00:00:30,790
So without further ado, go join
Kunal and Katherine and get started.
