1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,493
The current travels at 3 miles per hour. Excellent problem solving if you found

2
00:00:04,493 --> 00:00:08,535
that answer. To solve this equation, we'll start by multiplying through by the

3
00:00:08,535 --> 00:00:14,346
lowest common denominator. The LCD in this case is 12 minus x times 12 plus x

4
00:00:14,346 --> 00:00:21,364
times 15. The product of all three of the denominators. So we'll multiply each

5
00:00:21,364 --> 00:00:25,719
of these terms by the LCD. We'll note the factors of 12 minus x simplified in

6
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:30,310
the first fraction. 12 plus x simplifies in the second fraction. And 15

7
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:37,168
simplifies in our last fraction. Each of these reduces to 1. This leaves us

8
00:00:37,168 --> 00:00:42,920
with this equation. We know 6 times 15 equals 90, so we'll change these. And

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,460
then we know this is a difference of square pattern. a minus b times a plus b.

10
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,768
So this will equal a squared minus b squared. 12 squared is 144. We'll have our

11
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:58,515
minus sign in between the terms, and x squared is x squared. Next we'll

12
00:00:58,515 --> 00:01:03,438
distribute 90 to each of these terms. We'll distribute 90 here, and we'll

13
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:08,200
distribute positive 16 here. We get this equation, and then we want to combine

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,648
the like terms on the left. We know positive 90x, and negative 90x sum to 0.

15
00:01:14,648 --> 00:01:20,580
And 1080 plus 1080 sums to 2160. And the right hand side of our equation

16
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,072
remains the same. Now that we have this equation, we want to try and solve for

17
00:01:25,072 --> 00:01:29,418
x. Since I only have an x squared term and no other x terms, I want to move

18
00:01:29,418 --> 00:01:35,466
this constant to the left hand side, and then divide through by negative 16. So

19
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:40,068
we can take the square root of both sides. We subtract 2,304 from both sides to

20
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:47,201
get negative 144 equals negative 16 x squared. Then we divide both sides by

21
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:52,995
negative 16 to get 9 is equal to x squared. We take the square root of both

22
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:57,598
sides so x can equal positive 3 or negative 3. Since x is the speed of the

23
00:01:57,598 --> 00:02:02,412
current, we know that we need the positive value. x must equal 3 miles per

24
00:02:02,412 --> 00:02:03,390
hour.
