1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] The answer is 8.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's try this in the Python interpreter to see why.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
These are the first 2 assignments, and after these assignments

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
we can see that agent has the same value as spy.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Both spy and agent have the value a list containing 3 elements.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The element values are 0, 0, 7, and

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
they're actually the same list object because both agent and spy refer to that

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
same list that we created in the first assignment.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This means the value in agent position 2 is the number 7.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
When we do the third assignment we're assigning into position 2 of spy

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the value at position 2 of agent plus 1.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The value at position 2 of agent is 7, add 1 to that we get 8,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and we put that in position 2 of spy.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Since agent and spy refer to the same object that changes the value of both spy and agent,

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and we can see that both agent and spy now contain the value 8, and position 2.
