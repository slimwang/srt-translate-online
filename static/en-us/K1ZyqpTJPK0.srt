1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer to the question is that we look at the parents.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We find that the Sprinkler variable is negative,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
so we're looking at this part of the table.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And the Rain variable is positive, so we're looking at this part.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So, it would be these 2 rows that we would consider,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and thus, we'd find there's a 0.9 probability for w, the grass being wet,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and only 0.1 for it being negative,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
so the positive is more likely.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And once we've done that, then we generated a complete sample,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and we can write down the sample here.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We had +c, -s, +r.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And assuming we got a probability of 0.9 came out in favor of the +w,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
that would be the end of the sample.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Then we could throw all this information out and start over again

15
00:00:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
by having another 50/50 choice for cloudy and then working our way through the network.
