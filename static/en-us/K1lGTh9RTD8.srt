1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,540
Now let's add those other cats.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,170
First I'll copy all my cat's
from our last cat clicker.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,440
And I'm putting the cat data
at the very top of this file.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,610
Now I've put the cat data
at the top of the file,

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,695
but I also could load
this data from a server.

6
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:16,745
And when the list came
back from the server,

7
00:00:16,745 --> 00:00:18,565
I could add them to the application.

8
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:22,405
That'd be trivial to implement, and you
can do it for extra credit if you want.

9
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:25,975
Now what am I going to do with
this array of cat objects?

10
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:30,545
Well, down here in the ViewModel,
I'm going to want to create cats, and

11
00:00:30,545 --> 00:00:33,855
I'll want to store them
in an observable array.

12
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:35,870
I'm going to call it, catList.

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,780
Now you'll notice I'm not passing
in the array at the top of the file

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,350
right into this yet.

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,820
That's because I need
to take that data and

16
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,230
make a new cat out of
each of those objects.

17
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,170
I'm going to loop over
all of our initial cats.

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,350
And for each one of the cats,
I'm going to put it into the cat list.

19
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,000
Here we are doing a very
similar thing as we did.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,270
Here, but
instead of passing in an object literal,

21
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,709
we're passing in each of the cat items
in that initial cat array at the top.

22
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,440
You'll also notice we're using
the var self equals this trick.

23
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,280
That way if we say this dot cat list,
we don't end up getting confused

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,680
with what this function believes
that this keyword maps to.

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,980
Self is always going to
map to the view model.

26
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,490
So self.catList is going
to map to this cat list.

27
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,770
This observable array right here.

28
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,580
Now I am forgetting one other
thing which is the nicknames.

29
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,110
I'm going to grab our nicknames
from tabby up here and

30
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,110
I'm going to put them
in our initial data.

31
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:41,960
I'm also going to add a nickname from
Tiger to Tigger, Scaredy to Casper,

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,220
Shadow to Shooby, and Sleepy to Zzzzz.

33
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,400
Now my initial cat data has nicknames.

34
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,710
And in the ViewModel,
I'm looping over all the initial cats.

35
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,420
And pushing a new cat with each of
the cat items into the cat list.

36
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:57,920
Pretty good.

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:06,140
I'm also going to change this right
here to this.catList, item zero.

38
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,410
That way we're not creating
a new cat for the current cat.

39
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,470
Here we're making all
of the cats we need,

40
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,240
we don't need to create another one.

41
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:19,700
We just need to access the 0th element
in the cat list or our first cat.

42
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,500
Now we have a bit more work to do.

43
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,150
First, we need to make all
the cats show up in a list.

44
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,100
That should be a list of your cats on
the screen that users can click on.

45
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,849
You should be able to do that
entirely in your HTML with bindings.

46
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,800
Second we need to make the cats
in the cat list clickable.

47
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,550
When you click on the cat
name in the list,

48
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:45,030
it should change the current cat
observable to the new clicked cat.

49
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,980
That means we'll need to make a function
for setting the new current cat.

50
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,900
Those are the two main things
that you still have to do.

51
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,420
Make the cat show up, and

52
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,710
make the current cat change when you
click on one of those cats on the list.

53
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,220
Now take your time with this one.

54
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,530
Don't make a bunch of stabs in the dark.

55
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,440
The amount of code you'll need to do all
of this is actually pretty small, so

56
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,260
take the effort to really try and
understand what you need to do.

57
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,610
And what tools you have to do it.

58
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,530
Oh, and once you're done,
give yourself a high five.

59
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,350
You deserve it.
