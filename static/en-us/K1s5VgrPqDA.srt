1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,280
I'll start with a first one,

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,670
which in fact does cause
a forCED synchronous layout.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,060
Take a look here at window.scrollY.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,170
This is one of those properties that,
when accessed, will cause layout.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,340
So, you're causing layout and
then you're updating styles.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,930
This is putting the browser in a bad
read/write cycle between recalculate

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:18,920
styles and layout.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,630
So, this is a forced synchronous layout.

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,740
The second option also causes
a forced synchronous layout.

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,390
Once again, accessing offset height
causes the browser to run layout, and

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,270
then bam, here comes a style change.

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,870
This option is definitely bad for
performance.

13
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,150
This means that the third one does not
cause a forced synchronous layout.

14
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,970
Notice our accessing offset width
is happening outside of the loop.

15
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,210
That's a good strategy.

16
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,310
Layout runs once and then you batch
update the styles afterwards.

17
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,380
Very nice.

18
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,280
So the question is then,
how do you fix these two options?

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,950
You'll have to check out
the next quiz to find out.
