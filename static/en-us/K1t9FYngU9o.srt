Okay, this exercise is definitely for bonus points. Let's

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,620
say we want to transfer a 64 kilobyte file, over

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,730
a new [UNKNOWN] connection. The round trip time is

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,240
a 100 milliseconds. The Packet size is 1460 bytes. And

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,940
the initial congestion window is 10 packets. How long

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,480
would it take to download this file? Check the instructor

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,340
notes below for a walk through on how to

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,020
compute the answer. Good luck, this was a tricky one.
