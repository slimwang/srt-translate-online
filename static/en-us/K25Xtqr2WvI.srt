Welcome to Lesson 11. In Lesson 10, you learned about dependent samples or

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,974
repeated measures. Just to refresh your memory, that could be where we give the

3
00:00:08,974 --> 00:00:14,002
same person two different conditions to see how they react to each one. Maybe a

4
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:18,848
control and then a treatment, or maybe two types of treatments. Or, this could

5
00:00:18,848 --> 00:00:23,072
be longitudinal, where we measure some variable at some point in time, and then

6
00:00:23,072 --> 00:00:28,366
again at another and see if the variable changes. Or this could be a pre-test

7
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:31,976
and post-test. What was the measurement of a variable before and after a

8
00:00:31,976 --> 00:00:36,028
treatment? These are just a few situations in which we would use dependent

9
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:41,372
samples. This type of research design is really useful because it controls for

10
00:00:41,372 --> 00:00:46,144
indivdual differences. In other words, if we gave someone some kind of

11
00:00:46,144 --> 00:00:50,088
treatment, then those same individual differences will be present the next time

12
00:00:50,088 --> 00:00:55,470
we give that same treatment. That way we can see how two different treatments

13
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,655
play out under the same conditions. Because there's controls for individual

14
00:01:00,655 --> 00:01:05,019
differeneces, we could then use fewer subjects. And this is more cost

15
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:10,796
effective, less time consuming, and generally less expensive. However, there

16
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:16,247
are also a few disadvantages. One of which, is carry-over effects. For example,

17
00:01:16,247 --> 00:01:20,328
let's say we have this new method of teaching math. You want to know if it's

18
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:24,127
going to be effective. If you use the same group of students to test this new

19
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:27,962
teaching method, inevitably, they're going to be better at math the second time

20
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:32,700
around. So, if the first time we teach them one way, and then the second lesson

21
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,950
we teach them a different way, they'll already be better at math from learning

22
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:41,130
it the first time. Then we don't know if the results after the second treatment

23
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,320
are due to the fact that it was effective or due to the fact that they've

24
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,860
learned math before. That's just one example. The second measurement can be

25
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,766
affected by the first treatment. And the order in which we give the treatment

26
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:58,664
might influence the results. For example, say we want to test two types of

27
00:01:58,664 --> 00:02:02,859
pills. What if the first pill has some kind of interaction with the second

28
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:09,066
pill? And so, by taking it in that order they affect the results. Therefore, in

29
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:13,784
this lesson, you're going to learn about independent samples. Whereas,

30
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:18,131
dependent samples deals with within subject designs, independent samples deals

31
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:23,780
with between subject designs. In this case, the advantages of dependent samples

32
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,434
are the disadvantages of independent samples. And the disadvantages of

33
00:02:28,434 --> 00:02:33,453
dependent samples are the advantages of independent samples. Does that make

34
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:37,744
sense? With independent samples, we need more subjects because we need to

35
00:02:37,744 --> 00:02:43,292
randomize the two groups taking the two treatments. We need a larger end to

36
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:48,358
control for individual differences as best as possible. That means it's more

37
00:02:48,358 --> 00:02:52,244
time consuming and generally more expensive. But then the advantages of

38
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:56,798
independent samples are that we don't have carry over effects. Therefore, we

39
00:02:56,798 --> 00:03:00,254
can give one treatment to one group, another treatment to another group, and

40
00:03:00,254 --> 00:03:03,818
not worry about one treatment effecting the other, because each person or each

41
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:10,108
subject only gets one treatment. With independent samples, we can do an

42
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:16,016
experimental test where we give treatments to the subjects. Or observational,

43
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:20,164
where we simply observe characteristics of two different populations, and then

44
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:26,518
compare them. Everything is exactly the same. The Null and Alternative

45
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:32,681
Hypotheses, the t-statistic, and the way we make our statistical decision.
