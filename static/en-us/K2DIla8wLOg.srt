00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,524
In this unit, we'll explore radicals and rational exponents. It's likely that

2
00:00:05,524 --> 00:00:08,330
you've seen radicals before, but before we get into all these symbols and

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,477
different definitions, let's just look at some squares. We can think of a

4
00:00:12,477 --> 00:00:17,504
square root as the side length of one of these squares. This square has an area

5
00:00:17,504 --> 00:00:23,615
of 4, this square has an area of 25, And this square has an area of 81. Knowing

6
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:26,970
each of these areas, what do you think would be the square root, or the side

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,780
length of each of these squares? Write the side length for each of these sides

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,533
here and the same for the other squares.
