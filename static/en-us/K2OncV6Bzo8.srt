1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,479
This time the z score is 2.44 greater than our z critical value, that means

2
00:00:04,479 --> 00:00:10,721
that our sample mean falls somewhere up here. The probability of obtaining this

3
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:15,680
sample mean from a sample of size 50 is really small less than 2.5% and that's

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,976
what we need to know for a two tailed test therefore, we'll reject the null. We

5
00:00:21,976 --> 00:00:26,500
have evidence to believe that the song had an effect on engagement. We

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,990
formalize this by writing p for probability, is less than 0.05, our alpha

7
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:37,940
level. Because the probability of obtaining this sample mean, from a sample of

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,373
size 50, is less than our alpha level.
