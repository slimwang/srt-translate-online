1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,200
The last method that every provider
requires is called Get Type.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,820
It returns a string that
tells you the MIME type

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,807
of the data that's being accessed.

4
00:00:09,807 --> 00:00:13,179
Now a MIME type is just a standard
way to define a data type.

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,689
Similar to file types like JPEG or
plain text.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,540
For our purposes,
it's okay to leave this method blank

7
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:22,689
because we won't actually
be using it in our app.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,310
It only becomes useful when MIME
types are used to organize data or

9
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:27,820
to validate data.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,940
For example, an app might call getType
to distinguish between movie and

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:37,079
image types or to check data type before
doing something like a file conversion.

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,439
For our task data, the MIME types
we care about are, an item for

13
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:46,320
a single row of data, and
a directory for multiple rows of data.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,259
If you want more information
about getType and how it might

15
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:53,189
look in the to-do list code, take
a look at the instructor notes below.

16
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:56,250
But right now,
you already have a completed app.

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,409
So take some time to
congratulate yourself for

18
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:02,698
learning all of these new methods and go
ahead and enjoy your new to-do list app.
