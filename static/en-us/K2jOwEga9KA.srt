1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,840
Well that was inputs, now let's look at outputs.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,300
In particular the outputs produced by the concrete operations along with any

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,990
changes made to class attributes and

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,970
other side effects must satisfy the abstract specification.

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,710
Among other things this says the answers that your implementation give

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,450
had better satisfy what is required by the specification.

7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,600
Stated in logic.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,630
If we have some concrete state t, and the invariant is true, and

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,530
the preconditions are, the concrete preconditions are true,

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,860
and the, after executing the operation the concrete post conditions are true,

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,850
then it better be the case that the abstract post conditions are true.

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,250
Parsing this one step by step like we did for the inputs.

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,680
Valid concrete states as the part that says that for

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,480
all t element of the set of concrete states, capital T would be invariant.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,630
The concrete invariant must hold on that state.

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,240
And the concrete preconditions are satisfied, and

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,310
that's the Pre-Q sub i on t and whatever arguments we have.

18
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,220
And running the country operation satisfies the concrete post conditions.

19
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:11,090
That's the phrase with post Qi on a concrete state.

20
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:16,530
The arguments, the resulting concrete state T apostrophe, and

21
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,480
whatever results are produced.

22
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,610
Then the post condition had better map to the stated abstract post condition,

23
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,840
the last part of our post logic.

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,200
Which say's the post condition on the abstract operation Pi,

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,390
with the retrieve state, the arguments, the retrieved version of

26
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,600
the resultant state, and the results produced had better hold.

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,520
Note that as you might expect, the implement, the implementation can do

28
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,240
more than what the spec says as long as it does at least what the spec says.
