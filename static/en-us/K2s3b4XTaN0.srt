00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
For this question, you're asked to define a function, pick_one,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which takes as its input a Boolean and a Boolean can be the values True or False.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If the value of the Boolean is True, you're going to return the first input.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm going to call that true_response.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If the it's false, you return the second input--false_response.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I've named them like that so I don't forget which way around they are.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In order to define the procedure, I'll call the first variable boolean, with a lowercase b.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Don't forget the colon.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What we need is we need something that happens when the Boolean is true,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and if I do if boolean, then the code underneath this is executed when boolean is true.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
In that case, I want to return true_response.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,082
Otherwise, when the boolean is false, I want to return false_response.
