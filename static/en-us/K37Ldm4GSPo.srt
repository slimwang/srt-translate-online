1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So what happened is our looks something like this.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I left off the other attribute--it's no big deal; our variable (month)

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
gets substituted into the string.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So if: month = "November",

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the string, "November" renders and we get a text box

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that looks like this--which is what we'd expect.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But if (month) equals the string, foo--with a quote in it--

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and an angled bracket and some more text,

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the string we'll render ends up looking something like this,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
where we substitute this variable into here

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
because the value for (month) is actually this whole string--

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
including the quote and the angled bracket, which screwed up our HTML.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So our browser saw this--

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and it sees an and says: value equals "foo";

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and then it sees a closing quote and a closing angled bracket,

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and it gets this other string, derp, and it just prints that.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So that's, obviously, not the behavior we want.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The rendered HTML ends up looking--

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
or in the browser--ends up looking something like this.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You've got a text box with the word "foo" in it,

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and then it's just a quote and an angled bracket,

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and the string, derp, just hanging out there and--

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
you know--that's not what we intended.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And what's really scary is

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
this allows somebody who knows how our Web site works

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
to not just enter random text,

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
but what if they put HTML in our ?

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What if, instead of (derp) it was something better?

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's look at that in our browser.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So we're going to enter our bad data again--and this time,

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
we're going to put HTML in there.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay. So this time, I've put in a quote,

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
an angled bracket--to close our tag,

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and then I've put some HTML--a line break and some bold text.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And let's see what happens now.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, man! We completely broke our form.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You know--now we're printing the bold text, "oh no!"

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and we add a line break and this allows a user

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
to completely manipulate what our document looks like.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So that is not something we want to allow.

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,553
Let's talk about how to fix this.
