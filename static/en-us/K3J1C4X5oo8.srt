00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,059
Angular's concept of two-way data
binding is one of its claims to fame.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,710
It's a very cool feature but

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,090
the power of it can get a little lost
if you don't see it for yourself.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,230
I want you to try it out and

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,090
see how easily it turns a static
site into an interactive one.

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,880
Here's an app that helps
create awesome name tags.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,200
But typing in my name
doesn't do anything.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,700
To complete this quiz, add this code
right here to the H1 in main.name HTML.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,820
Then go back to the browser and
add your name to the page.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,375
Change the text to orange.

11
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,445
And add a strikethrough to the text.

12
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:34,225
While you're exploring the app,
pay attention to how quickly and

13
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:36,335
easily you can change
the page's content.

14
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:39,125
The link to the starter code for
this project is in the instructor notes.

15
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,485
When you finish building the template,

16
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:42,715
the feedback extension
will give you a code.

17
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:43,865
Enter that code on the next page.
