00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[Narrator] For this quiz your goal is to define a procedure named replace_spy

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that takes as its input a list of 3 numbers and modifies the value of the third element

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
in input list to be 1 more than its previous value.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
To solve this quiz you're going to have to

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
experiment and understand how values are past procedures in Python.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Something we haven't talked about yet, but if you solve this quiz

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
you'll have a good understanding of how things might work.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The behavior that we want is shown in an example,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
so if the value of spy is the list 0, 0, 7,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
we call the procedure replace spy, passing in spy.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Note that we're not using the result.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We're not assigning this back into a variable spy.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We're just calling replace spy, but after the call

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
the value that spy refers to has changed.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now it has the value 0, 0, 8.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So, I haven't yet told you what it means to pass a mutable object

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
like a list to a procedure, but try to define replace spy

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and see if you can figure out what happens.
