00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,495
The midpoint is located right here. The coordinates of that point are 100 and

2
00:00:04,507 --> 00:00:08,738
350. When I figured this out the first time, I basically eyeballed where I

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,271
thought halfway along the line was, and then figure out the coordinates of that

4
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:17,659
point. But is there a way that we can use the coordinates of the two points on

5
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:22,096
the line that we already know to find the coordinates of the point halfway

6
00:00:22,108 --> 00:00:26,390
between them? In fact, there is. We know that home is located at 0,0, the

7
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:30,919
origin, and the Udacity is located at 200 700,. Going halfway between these

8
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:35,063
points, means going both halfway in the x-direction and halfway in the

9
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:39,442
y-direction. So, let's look at those coordinates individually. For the

10
00:00:39,454 --> 00:00:43,588
x-coordinate, we start at 0 and we want to go halfway to 200, half of the

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,709
distance between 0 and 200 is 100. So, you just go over that much. That

12
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:52,415
automatically gives us our x-coordinate. The y-coordinate works in pretty much

13
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:56,900
the same way. Our initial y-coordinate of home is 0, we want to go up 700, to

14
00:00:56,912 --> 00:01:04,175
where Udacity located vertically. This distance is 700 miles, so half of 700 is

15
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:04,575
350.
