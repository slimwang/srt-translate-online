00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,880
Eric Gonzales I work on
Android apps at Udacity.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,840
I start working on the Udacity app for

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,240
a deadline we had of shipping
the app the day of Google IO.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,360
And so I joined the company about five
weeks or so before we had to ship and

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,580
so moved Mountain View and work late and
shipped with a small team.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,850
The way I familiarize
myself the code base, was

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:29,265
really more getting acquainted with the
Udacity APIs more than the entry code.

8
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:31,830
Most of the entry code is
pretty straightforward

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,070
in terms of Android development, but the
way in which you fetch data from Udacity

10
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,210
was quite different and so that's where
there was a bit of a learning curve.

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,970
The activities in the Udacity
app are pretty straightforward.

12
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,660
They're grouped of course logically by
the activity you normally do on the site

13
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,420
or in the classroom.

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,970
So we have the notion of a catalog for
instance.

15
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,820
We have individual details for courses
and those are their own activities.

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,580
Same thing for authentication, you
have activities for authentication or

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,940
viewing your enrollments, pretty much
everything you can map to an activity

18
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,850
that you do in the Udacity classroom,
maps to an activity in Udacity app.

19
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,090
So we use intense throughout
the app pretty much everywhere.

20
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,780
So whenever you transition between like
let's say, logging into the catalog or

21
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,910
to your enrollments.

22
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,090
Those are all using explicit intent.

23
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,050
So it's same specifically I know
I want to transition from this

24
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,930
activity to the next one, and
these are maybe arguments or

25
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,450
the different primers can be useful
when loading that new state.

26
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,940
So we use very few implicit intensity
in the app just because of the nature

27
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,600
of it, we don't really have a lot of
dependencies on like I don't have to

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,990
scan a bar code or

29
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,970
take a picture or things that would
have a dependency outside of myself.

30
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,020
There is one place so
that we use implicit intent and it's for

31
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,970
sending support emails.

32
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,700
So if you're having
an issue with the app or

33
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,490
you have an issue with your account or
app,

34
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,260
of course, what email client you use or
how to send an email,

35
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,450
we use an implicit intent
to generate that response.

36
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,610
So you can send a support ticket.

37
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,010
When I want to make a button
interactive for my layout.

38
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,440
Of course when you
have in your activity,

39
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,640
I would have to find the view
that maps to that button.

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,910
And then once I find it,
I can set a listener.

41
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,220
A click listener on it.

42
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,420
So that I can take a specific
action on it, if I want to.

43
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,160
So that could be firing
maybe a new activity.

44
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,970
Or that could be
performing a network call.

45
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,330
Like enrolling a student in a course.
