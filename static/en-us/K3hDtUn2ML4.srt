1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It turns out that standard deviation of distribution is not dependent on the sample,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
so whether you throw a coin 100 times or a 1000 times when you graph the outcomes

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
the standard deviation is not affected by the sample size but the confidence interval is.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's a really important difference.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If there's one thing you want to take home from this class that is that as you get more data as a statistician,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
your confidence increases--so your confidence interval shrinks,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
whereas of course more data doesn't change the standard deviation.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In fact, if the standard deviation is σ, then the confidence interval is effectively 1/√Nσ.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is proportional, depends on number of other factors. There could be a constant in front of it.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But there is an interesting relationship.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
As you get more data, the standard deviation will become more accurate,

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
but it's not going to change that much.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Your confidence will shrink, and we're going to look into this a more detail.
