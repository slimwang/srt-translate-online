00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,782
On these two separate graphs right now, I put all of the parent polynomial

2
00:00:03,782 --> 00:00:07,939
functions that we've talked about so far. And they're grouped according to which

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:11,832
ones he said had similar end behavior. Or in other words, similar behavior at

4
00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:15,736
either tail of the graph moving away from to origin. However, I have added one

5
00:00:15,736 --> 00:00:19,579
extra graph, we didn't talk about in this session explicitly and that's the

6
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:24,361
graph of y equals x. Remember that technically the variable x is a polynomial.

7
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:29,070
It's just a polynomial of first degree. Pretty simple. I know that it looks

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,479
pretty different from both x cubed and x to the 5th, but I do have a reason for

9
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,765
putting it over here. You'll see in a second. First of all though, the similar

10
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:41,175
behavior of graphs over here and of graphs over here, has led these groups of

11
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:45,773
functions to have names. All the functions on one of these two graphs are even

12
00:00:45,773 --> 00:00:50,219
functions. And the other set are odd functions. So which one do you think is

13
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,667
which? I've labeled this set of graphs a, and this set of graphs b. Just use

14
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:57,213
your common sense to answer this question.
