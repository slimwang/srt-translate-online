1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,070
If you're still here, I assume that
means you've decided that you are ready

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,988
for this machine learning
engineering nano degree program.

3
00:00:05,988 --> 00:00:07,598
In which case, I welcome you again.

4
00:00:07,598 --> 00:00:08,660
Before we get started, though,

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,700
let's talk a little bit about
what is machine learning?

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,690
Machine learning has been
described as a lot of things.

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,170
It's been described as the next natural
step for artificial intelligence.

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,070
It's been described as
applied statistics.

9
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,150
It's been described as
just advanced algorithms.

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,060
And in reality,
it's kind of all of these things.

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,200
Like artificial intelligence.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,480
It's about processing some data and
understanding data and

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,500
reacting intelligently to it.

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,340
Like statistics, it's about applying
advanced formulas to really

15
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,490
make sense and compare and
evaluate and summarize data.

16
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,630
Like algorithms,
it operates on some data input.

17
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,230
It provides some output.

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,910
So, really machine learning
is about the next synthesis

19
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,750
of lots of different fields, it's
really the next natural evolution for

20
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,220
a lot of things you've
studied in the past.
