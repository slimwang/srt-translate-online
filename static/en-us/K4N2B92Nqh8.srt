00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,120
So listening on a port is a very
simple sort of being a server.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,689
A program that listens on
a TCP port is waiting for

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:08,810
another program to connect to that port.

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,340
Once that happens, the two programs
can send data back and forth.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,660
Here's a quick and easy demonstration.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,970
Open up a couple of SSH
sessions to your Linux box.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,860
In one of them,
run nc -l for listen, 3456.

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,350
Okay, that doesn't do very much yet.

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,874
Now in the other one,

10
00:00:30,874 --> 00:00:35,560
run nc localhost 3456.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,998
Still not very much, but
what if we type some stuff?

12
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:42,526
Hey, check it out.

13
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:47,500
Whatever we type in here
comes out over there.

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,350
Switch back and forth.

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,660
Whatever we put in on one side comes out
over on the other side and vice versa.

16
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,680
In this case there's no HTTP involved.

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,470
This isn't a web server.

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,612
It's one layer below that,
it's a plain TCP server.

19
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:06,064
The nc in this terminal is talking to
the nc over in this other terminal,

20
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:09,478
just over plain TCP,
with no other layer between it and

21
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:12,762
the network, and
both sides can send to each other.

22
00:01:12,762 --> 00:01:16,130
A TCP session is like a two-way road.

23
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,540
Although it's hard for me to show here
because I only have the one keyboard,

24
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,850
it's possible for both ends of a TCP
session to be sending at the same time.

25
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,190
Now you try it.

26
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,000
With two terminals SSH'ed into
your Linux box, on one of them,

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,160
set an nc process listening on a port.

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,600
You can pick whatever
port number you want.

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,055
You don't have to use 3456.

30
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:41,280
And then in another terminal,
connect to it with nc localhost 3456.

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,680
Try typing into each one.

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,190
And then when you're done,

33
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,300
figure out how to disconnect them
without just closing the SSH session.
