00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,104
We've been working pretty much solely with polynomial expressions of degree 2

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:08,401
since we started talking about parabolas, like this one right here. However, we

3
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:12,370
know from earlier on in the course that expressions can have terms with even

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,790
higher powers. Let's take a second to look at one of those right now. How about

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:21,375
something like this, x cubed minus x squared plus three x minus three. Now, my

6
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:25,714
question for you is, can we factor this? Well, we have been talking about

7
00:00:25,714 --> 00:00:30,116
factoring by grouping a fair amount and we already have four terms here, so

8
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:34,362
let's try it out. Maybe it will work. Let's consider the first two terms

9
00:00:34,362 --> 00:00:38,734
together as a pair. And then the last two terms is a pair. And for each of these

10
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:43,024
pairs, please write in the box below it what the greatest common factor that we

11
00:00:43,024 --> 00:00:46,866
can pull put is. To make my life easier in the future, I'm going to call

12
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:49,275
greatest common factor, the initials GCF.
