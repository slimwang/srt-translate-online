00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,277
>> Well, if no time has passed, then we start with $200. That's how much was

2
00:00:04,277 --> 00:00:08,918
initially in our savings account. We know each month we save exactly $100. So,

3
00:00:08,918 --> 00:00:13,382
after one month I would have $300, and then, if another month goes by, I save

4
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:18,136
another $100, and we can easily fill out the rest of the table. But remember, in

5
00:00:18,136 --> 00:00:22,681
algebra, we want to know for x number of months how much money would we have.

6
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:28,100
Well we start with 200 and then we multiply the number of months by 100. So we

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,452
also need to add 100x. Now we've related the amount of money we saved with the

8
00:00:33,452 --> 00:00:38,450
number of months, x. We have this equation, y is equal to 200 plus 100x.

00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:43,233
Congrats if you got this right. I know this isn't the easiest algebraic

10
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:48,147
reasoning, but if you work from a table and build it up, you can get here and we

11
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:53,161
can switch these two terms around. I could have the 100x come first, followed by

12
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:55,056
200. This is the same equation.
