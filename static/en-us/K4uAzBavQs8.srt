00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,816
We studied a number of different
authentication methods and

2
00:00:03,816 --> 00:00:06,674
their implementation
in a computer system.

3
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:11,539
Our security mindset approach requires
that we consider any threats that

4
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:15,628
may exist against these methods and
their implementations.

5
00:00:15,628 --> 00:00:19,897
So, we did consider the strengths and
weaknesses that exist for

6
00:00:19,897 --> 00:00:24,020
each of these methods and
how we use them in computer systems.
