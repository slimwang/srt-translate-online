1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,650
David what was your answer?

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,410
>> So this time we're looking at
the origin instead of the destination.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,770
We start at the route and ask,
is the origin north of 5N?

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,802
Just barely it is.

5
00:00:08,802 --> 00:00:10,282
Is it East of 5E?

6
00:00:10,282 --> 00:00:11,512
No, is it east of 3E?

7
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,627
No, is it east of 2E?

8
00:00:12,627 --> 00:00:14,210
It's really not east of anything.

9
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,890
So the case we retrieve
is going to be Y.

10
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,900
>> Thatâ€™s right David.

11
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,070
Y is the closest matching
case to the new problem.
