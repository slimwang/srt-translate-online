00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's make sure we're all on the same page about these simple regular expressions

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and the "findall" function in Python that allows us to manipulate them.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I've written out three Python expressions involving re.findall

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that returns a list of substrings that match the given regular expression.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What I'd like you to do is for each of those lists

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
write out the elements in the list in the correct order.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,252
Fill in the boxes with the elements of the return values of the findall expressions.
