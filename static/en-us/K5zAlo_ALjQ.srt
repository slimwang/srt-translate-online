00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The thing that is suspicious is that in this binomial distribution, it seems that the frequency

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
of outcomes is centered around the expected outcome of 0.5 that falls off

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
according to a funny looking curve--often called a bell curve and the reason is

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
this could be the world's largest church bell.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The significance of this bell curves in the relationship to what's called the

00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
central limit theorem will be discussed in the next unit.
