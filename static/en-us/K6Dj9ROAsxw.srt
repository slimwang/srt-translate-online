00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,250
This exercise extends the heirarchy of the robot arm by adding the body object

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,000
so that the arm is attached to its top. Instead of adding the arm to the scene

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,525
itself, we create the body and then we attach the arm to the top of it. And

4
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:12,213
that's really it.
