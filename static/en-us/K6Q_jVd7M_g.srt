1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,180
In order to complete this first
challenge, I must first import

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,180
the classes I used to execute my
CRUD operations from lesson one.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,440
I will import Base, Restaurant, and

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,790
MenuItem from my database_setup file,
as well as create_engine and

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,560
sessionmaker from my sqlalchemy and
sqlalchemy.orm libraries.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,640
Along with my imports,

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,940
I must also add these four lines
of code to connect to my database.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,060
Once again,
just copying code written in Lesson One.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,625
Now I will add another if statement to
my do_GET method such that landing on

10
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:33,240
/restaurants lists out all of
the restaurants in my database.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,396
Let's look at this new if statement,
where I once looked for /hello or

12
00:00:37,396 --> 00:00:41,030
/hola, I'm now looking for
the /restaurants path.

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,570
I then execute a query to get all
of the restaurants in the database.

14
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,460
My response codes are the same as with
my previous do_GET if statements.

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,210
But here I execute a for loop and that
all of the restaurant menu items to my

16
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,320
output string separated with brake
lines and enclose in my HTML body tags.

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,950
I write the output to my wfile and
send it off to the client.

18
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,459
When I save and restart my web
server I get an output like this.

19
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,410
When I visit local host
port 8080/restaurants,

20
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,850
it lists out all of
the restaurants in my database.

21
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,540
Objective one complete.

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,420
See the instructor notes if you'd like
to see my code for objective one.
