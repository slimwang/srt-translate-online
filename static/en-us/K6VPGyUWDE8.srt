1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,215
So this first paragraph in fact, was written by the great novelist James Joyce

2
00:00:04,215 --> 00:00:09,743
and it's from his novel Ulysses. And this, we can deem quite creative, in fact

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:14,520
it was, because it did something quite different. Not only different, but

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,357
unique. So the second paragraph was authored by someone suffering from

5
00:00:18,357 --> 00:00:23,273
schizophrenia. And who's speaking really in what we call word solid. And this

6
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:28,134
is not creative. So these two quotes demonstrate that creativity is something

7
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:33,422
more than just originality. What it is and what it isn't. They're both equally

8
00:00:33,422 --> 00:00:38,140
original but the first also solve the problem in an adaptive and useful way.
