1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,830
However, there are some gotcha's here.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,510
What happens, for example,
if the length of the document is zero?

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,310
All of sudden, you have divided by zero.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,580
>> Right.

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,080
>> Okay.
>> Right.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,430
>> So we would have to consider that as

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,980
a special case.

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,670
Also, what exactly do we mean
by the size of the handle?

9
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,640
As we said,

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,190
we probably from the GUI toolkit would
get some pixels, a number of pixels.

11
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,470
But we'd need to translate that into
something like a percentage, or

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,230
an integer count of things.

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,060
And then there's an even
more subtle situation.

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,486
Let's say that we've scrolled
to the end of the file.

15
00:00:41,486 --> 00:00:42,418
>> Okay.

16
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:46,870
>> And we re-sized the window
to make it bigger.

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,070
>> Okay.

18
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:49,760
>> What happens?

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,020
What do we expect to
see in the viewport?

20
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,330
So one possibility is we would
see exactly the same lines, but

21
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,790
now some blank lines at the bottom.

22
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:00,570
>> Okay.

23
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,489
>> Another possibility is
that the line that was at

24
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,720
the bottom of the viewport before stays
at the bottom of the viewport, and

25
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,050
we see some more lines at the top.

26
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,590
And, in fact, if you go play around
with actual web browsers out there, and

27
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:21,000
with word processing editors and so on,
you can see both of these behaviors.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,010
However, if we're
designing the application,

29
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,470
we have to make the decision about
which one of those two behaviors

30
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,040
we actually intend that
the text browser to have.

31
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,540
Okay?

32
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,260
So, this process of modeling has forced
us into thinking about something

33
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,010
which we might not have,
otherwise, thought about,

34
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,910
which is one of the benefits
of doing the modeling.

35
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,720
It forces you to think
through subtleties of things.
