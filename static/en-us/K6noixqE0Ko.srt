1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,733
So, we saw that we could get three solutions when we have a third power for a

2
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:08,144
variable. In this case the three solutions were all different. But sometimes we

3
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:12,639
can get the same solution more than once. For example, in this equation, one of

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,613
the solutions will be repeated. Do you think you can find what they are?
