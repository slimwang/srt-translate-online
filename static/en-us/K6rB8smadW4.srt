1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So the answer is that Bob can cheat.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And the reason that Bob can cheat--

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
well, remember this hash function is not encryption.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
There are no secrets that go into it.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's only providing this commitment to the input,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and so Bob can easily cheat in this case.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
He can compute by himself the hash of zero, the hash of one,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
check them, whether they equal m,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and then instead of guessing, he can pick whichever one did.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So, with this protocol Bob can always win.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm going to leave it as an open discussion problem

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
for you to figure out how to fix this protocol.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And there are definitely lots of different ways to do this.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I hope there will be some interesting discussion about it on the forums.
