00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,469
In this last lesson of the course, you're going to be introduced to some real

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,846
life examples. That can be described mathematically by exponential growth,

3
00:00:07,846 --> 00:00:12,294
exponential decay, and logarithmic growth. Now you've already seen the

4
00:00:12,294 --> 00:00:15,366
equations that correspond to each of these types of functions before, so I'm

5
00:00:15,366 --> 00:00:19,950
just going to refresh you on them. These forms I've written here may be

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,338
slightly different than what we've talked about. Note for example, that our

7
00:00:24,338 --> 00:00:28,050
bases for our two exponential functions are e, and the base for our log

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,210
function is 10. So this is just one way of expressing these types of functions.

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,960
The question is, do you remember what each of these two functions looks like?

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,459
So to jog your memory on that, here are three graphs. I've labeled them A, B

11
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:46,869
and C and I'd like you to tell me which one corresponds to each of these types

12
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:48,810
of functions.
