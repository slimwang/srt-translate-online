1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,128
Our solution is 6 minus x, divided by the quantity x minus 8. Great job if you

2
00:00:05,128 --> 00:00:09,759
got this rational expression. We factor the numerator the same as before, but

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:15,536
this time in the denominator we want factors of -8 and positive 6. They multiply

4
00:00:15,536 --> 00:00:21,090
to give us -48, and a sum to get us -2. I noticed that x plus 6 and 6 plus x are

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,374
really the same factors.So I can cancel those since they equal 1. This leaves me

6
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:30,864
with the remaining factors, so I have 6 minus x divided by x minus 8. You might

7
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:34,634
have switched the order of these two terms, giving you negative x plus 6 for the

8
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:38,684
numerator. This would be okay. You might even have gone a step further, and

9
00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:42,965
factored negative 1 from the numerator, and that would have been okay too. All

10
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:47,157
of these answers are correct. And if you even followed my advice from the first

11
00:00:47,157 --> 00:00:50,141
time, a negative sign out in front would look like this.
