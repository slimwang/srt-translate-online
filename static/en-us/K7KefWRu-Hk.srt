00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,460
If we add the two equations together, the x terms eliminate and add to zero. 15y

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,611
and negative 4y equals 11y and negative 75 minus 2 makes negative 77. We can

3
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:15,497
divide both sides by 11, so one 1y is equal to negative 7. We found y so now

4
00:00:15,497 --> 00:00:20,823
let's go and find x. Remember we could use either of the original equations to

5
00:00:20,823 --> 00:00:25,415
find the other variable. Usually it's best to use the original equations,

6
00:00:25,415 --> 00:00:29,447
because sometimes we might have made a mistake when multiplying, so we don't

7
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:33,360
want to use these multiplied equations. I'm going to use the second equation, 5x

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,342
plus 2y equals 1. This is a great opportunity to pause the video. Maybe you can

9
00:00:37,342 --> 00:00:41,882
try to find the value of x by plugging in to this first equation instead. See if

10
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:47,758
we get the same result. So I can take the value of y, which is negative 7, and

11
00:00:47,758 --> 00:00:53,153
plug it in for y in this second equation. So I get 5x plus 2 times negative 7

12
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:58,081
equals 1. 2 times negative 7 is negative 14. Then we add 14 to both sides of the

13
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:05,021
equation. So 5x is equal to 15. We divide both sides by 5, so x is equal to 3.

14
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:08,495
This is great. We found our solution.
