1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,699
And as we said before, and that's where the name inverse halt comes from,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:09,066
inverse halt more or less does the opposite of what halt says the original program will do.

3
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:15,399
So if halt says that P1, when run on P1, says yes, then inverse halt will go into an infinite loop,

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,232
and vice versa for P2, where halt says that it will not terminate when run on itself.

5
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:22,900
Inverse halt will actually terminate.
