00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,370
The main concept of HTTP is that
clients tell servers what they

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,650
want by using an HTTP verb,
also know as an HTTP method.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,970
There are nine HTTP verbs in
the current HTTP specification.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,340
The two most commonly used methods for
websites though, are GET and POST.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,290
A GET request can be thought of
as the client telling the server,

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,260
get me some information that you have.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,580
Or, a POST can be thought
of as the client saying,

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,160
I want to modify some
information that you have.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,590
GETs are sometimes called safe methods,

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,795
since they are only used to retrieve
existing data from the database,

11
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:37,720
whereas POSTs call for data to be added,
removed, or changed on a server.

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,050
We know that the client prefixes
requests to the server with HTTP verbs.

13
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,730
So, how does the server reply?

14
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,650
Status codes are the server's
reply to a client as to

15
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,910
what happened after a specific request.

16
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,550
In addition to a status code,

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,380
a server can also supply any requested
resources the client requested,

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:00,270
such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and
media files such as images and audio.

19
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,420
Some common response codes are 200,
which indicates a successful GET

20
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,430
request, 301, which is a successful
post request, and 404, which indicates

21
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,170
that we were looking for a file on the
server, and the server couldn't find it.

22
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,100
In the next section, we'll put all
of these concepts together as we

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,710
create our own web server in Python.
