1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here's my solution for the second problem where we have multiple %s's,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and if you recall from the lesson, the way we include that is we just include them

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
in a tuple or a list.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So let's give this version a test.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay, we run this, and it prints, I think running and jumping are perfectly normal things.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay, while we're on this editor, let me show you some common mistakes.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
One thing you might do is you only include 1 variable,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
so I got rid of the s2 there.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's try running our function now.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We get this big exception.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There are not enough arguments for format string, which basically means

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
our format string--this t2 string--has 2 %s's in it, and we only included 1.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So if you see that a lot, or if you see that, that means make sure you have

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
all of your parameters.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's move on to an even more complex version.
