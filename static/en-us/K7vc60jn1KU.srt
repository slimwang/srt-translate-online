1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,680
So, that's kind of just the motivation for the

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,460
simulating the Annealing Algorithm, but there's an actual algorithm and

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,540
it's, it's remarkably simple and remarkably effective. So, the algorithm

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,200
goes like this, for, we're just going to repeat for some

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,560
finite set of iterations. We're going to be at some

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,540
point x, and we're going to sample a new point

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,300
x of t, from the neighborhood of x. And then

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,450
what are we going to do? Well, we're going to move

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,860
our x to that x t, probabilistically. So

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,280
in particular, we've got this probability function pxxtt, which

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,520
is going to help us decide whether or not

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,340
to actually make the move. And it's, and, and

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,610
the form of that function is written out

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,860
here. So, the probability that if we're currently at

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,680
x, and we're thinking about moving to x sub

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,670
t, little t, and the current temperature is capital

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,090
T, then what's going to happen? If the fitness of the new

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,430
point is bigger than or equal to the old point, we're

19
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,457
just going to make the move. Right? So we always hill climb

20
00:00:59,457 --> 00:01:02,230
when we are at a point where we can do that.

21
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,560
>> So that's just rigorall hill climbing.

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,650
>> It's kind of like hill climbing, exactly. It's a little different from

23
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,610
the hill climbing the way we described it, where we said let's

24
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,900
visit all the points in the neighborhood. This is kind of a

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,470
useful thing to be able to do when the neighborhood's really large,

26
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,320
just choose anything in the neighborhood, and if

27
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,890
it's an improvement, you know, go for it.

28
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:19,270
>> Okay.

29
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,290
>> But, what if it's not an improvement? Well

30
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,850
if it's not an improvement, what we're going to do is

31
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,840
we're going to look at the fitness difference between the point

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,680
that we're evaluating, and the point where we are now.

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,850
Look at the difference between those two, divide that by

34
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,800
the temperature, take E to that, and interpret that as

35
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,110
a probability. And we either make the move or not

36
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,542
with that probability. So, alright, so let's, we've gotta dive

37
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:42,654
in a little bit to this expression to make some sense out of

38
00:01:42,654 --> 00:01:49,210
it. So, what happens, Charles, if the point that we currently visited x,

39
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,890
then we visit a neighbor point X T, what if their fitnesses are

40
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,813
really close to each other, say you

41
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,680
know, just Infinitimally close to each other.

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,030
>> Well, if they're infinitesimally close to one another, then

43
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,480
that means that difference is going to be very close to 0.

44
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,595
>> Right, and so we get

45
00:02:05,595 --> 00:02:09,370
0 over doesn't matter what the temperature is, we get 0. E to the 0 is 1,

46
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,984
so we make the move if it's you

47
00:02:11,984 --> 00:02:14,840
know, infinitesimally smaller than, than where we are now.

48
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,840
>> Mm-hm. Alright, what if it's a, what if it's a big step down?

49
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,820
>> Well, then, that means that number's really, really, negative.

50
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,010
>> Yes.

51
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,374
>> And the negative divided by some positive number T is

52
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:28,060
the temperature, so T's always greater than or equal to 0.

53
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,276
[BLANK_AUDIO]

54
00:02:33,276 --> 00:02:34,060
>> Yeah, let's say that.

55
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,250
>> Okay.

56
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,690
>> In fact, probably making it equal to 0 could run

57
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,850
us into trouble. So let's just say that it's bigger this year.

58
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,030
>> So it's Kelvin. So it's in Kelvin. Okay, so

59
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,100
>> [LAUGH]. we, that'd be a really, really big

60
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,160
negative number, and E to a really big negative

61
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,010
number is 1 over E to a really big number. So that makes it very close to 0.

62
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,560
>> Good, right. So, in other words, if

63
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,070
a giant step down, we probably won't take it.

64
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,290
>> Right, okay, that makes sense, so you're sort

65
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:05,220
of smoothly going in directions that kind of look bad as a function of how

66
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,610
bad they look, and sort of exaggerating

67
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,852
that difference through an exponential function. [LAUGH] Right?

68
00:03:11,852 --> 00:03:15,610
>> [LAUGH] Sure. If, if that, if that gets you going.

69
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,770
>> Well so 3 isn't 3 times worse than 1.

70
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,620
It's you know, 2 to the 3 times worse than 1.

71
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,360
>> I see, or E to the. Well so, so good, but let's, let's look

72
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,050
at one more thing with this equation here. Lets,

73
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,930
lets say that there's You know, a moderate step down.

74
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,110
>> Mm-hm. So, it's not so huge that when we divide it by T, it's essentially

75
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,260
negative infinity. Let's just say it's a smaller

76
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,980
thing, you know, - 5 or something like that.

77
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,330
>> Okay.

78
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,920
>> Then what, what happens? Now we get some E

79
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,370
to the that is going to be some probability between 0

80
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,850
and 1. What does the T, what does T do?

81
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,860
In this case. What if T is something really big?

82
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,370
What if, what if, what if T is something really small?

83
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,520
>> Well, T is something really big. Let's say, infinity then,

84
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,020
it doesn't matter what the difference is. It's effectively going to be 0.

85
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,680
>> Right, so really big temperature here means that we're going to have some

86
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,600
negative thing divided by something else. This

87
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,310
is going to be, essentially 0. It's going to

88
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,165
be E to the 0, so it's going to be 1. So, when the temperature's

89
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:12,388
really high, we're actually willing to take

90
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:13,980
downward steps. So, we don't even sort

91
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,150
of notice that it's going down.

92
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,265
>> Right.

93
00:04:15,265 --> 00:04:17,190
>> There's lots of randomness happening.

94
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,519
>> Right. So, in fact, if key is infinity, it's really, really, really,

95
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:27,680
really hot then even if the neighbor, is much, much worse off. He'll

96
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,950
be less worse off than, infinity, and so, basically you're always just going to

97
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,810
jump to the next person. To the next neighbor. To the next point.

98
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,700
>> Right. So we're very likely to accept.

99
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,240
So the, so it's going to move freely. If

100
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,090
T is really small, as T approaches 0

101
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,970
what happens? Well let's just take the extreme

102
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,750
case. So T was 0 or effectively 0,

103
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,800
then that means any difference whatsoever basically becomes infinity.

104
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,340
>> Right, it gets magnified by this very, very small T.

105
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,180
>> Right. And so then it's not going to take

106
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,940
any downwards steps. It's only going to go uphill. Yeah, so

107
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,930
that's kind of the essence of the Similarity Annealing Algorithm,

108
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,875
so maybe we can talk about some of its properties.

109
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,474
>> OK.
