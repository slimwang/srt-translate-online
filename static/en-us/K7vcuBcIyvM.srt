>> The absolute value of 14 plus 7 measures the distance between 14 and negative

00:00:04,812 --> 00:00:09,398
7. Notice that in the example of the distance between negative 12 and 5, we

3
00:00:09,398 --> 00:00:14,251
could find this two ways. So we either have negative 12 minus 5, or if we go the

4
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:18,677
other way, we have 5 minus negative 12. 14 plus 7 is the same as 14 minus

5
00:00:18,677 --> 00:00:23,308
negative 7. So the other way that we could write this distance will be by

6
00:00:23,308 --> 00:00:28,311
starting with negative 7 and then subtracting 14. Of course both of these gives

7
00:00:28,311 --> 00:00:31,202
the distance of 21, between 14 and negative 7.
