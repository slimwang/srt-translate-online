00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,959
Let's talk about the information we get from the problem. We see that the line

2
00:00:04,959 --> 00:00:09,703
has a slope of 5, so that means m equals 5. The fact that it goes to the point

3
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:14,631
2, 3 means that x1 equals 2, if we're using the variables from the point-slope

4
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:19,297
form equation, and y1 equals 3. Now we just need to insert these into the

5
00:00:19,297 --> 00:00:22,573
equation. We get y minus 3 equals 5 times x minus 2.
