00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,777
So now that we've talked about what
polynomials are, and seen a few examples

2
00:00:03,789 --> 00:00:07,633
of them, which of these expressions are
not polynomials? Notice I want you to

3
00:00:07,645 --> 00:00:11,331
check the ones that are not polynomials,
not the ones that are polynomials.

4
00:00:11,422 --> 00:00:15,457
Remember the three requirements that an
expression must fit in order to count as a

5
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:19,604
polynomial. I have listed them right here
in case you need to check. And if you have

6
00:00:19,616 --> 00:00:23,676
trouble with this just go back and watch
the last video to refresh yourself on what

7
00:00:23,688 --> 00:00:23,693
apolynomial is. Goodluck.
