Hopefully, this gave you a nice little review of polynomial multiplication. I'm

00:00:04,327 --> 00:00:08,630
sure that you remembered exactly how to distribute correctly. When we multiply

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,760
f of x times g of x, or, in other words, x plus 1 times 2x minus 5, we end up

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,934
with 2x squared minus 3x minus 5.
