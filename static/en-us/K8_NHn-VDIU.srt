1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,320
As you learned back in
the first lesson and

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,070
as you rediscovered in the last lesson,
not all style changes are equal.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,000
Some will trigger layout,
paint and composite.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,970
Some will trigger paint and composite.

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,730
And some will just trigger composite.

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,550
>> In this lesson you'll learn how
to optimize the last two stages

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,560
of the pipeline.

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,480
Painting and compositing.

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,620
If you want a full break down of how
styles affect the rendering pipeline,

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,160
check out Paul's awesome website,
csstriggers.com,

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,130
and you can find a link to
it in the instructor notes.

12
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,870
So when you're wondering if the thing
that you want to animate is going to

13
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,439
trigger a layout, paint, or

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,370
composite, check out csstriggers.com
because it's got you covered.

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,290
Cool.
All right,

16
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,510
let's see what we've got in our tool kit
for getting our heads around painting.

17
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,040
Paint is normally one of the fastest
ways to kill your friends per second.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,240
And let's face it, that's exactly
what we're trying to avoid here.
