1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,929
The values of x that satisfy this inequality are from negative 5 halves to

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:09,317
positive 3. Great work if you found this interval. As usual, we begin by

3
00:00:09,317 --> 00:00:14,699
finding the 0s for this quadratic equation. We set this quadratic expression

4
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:20,630
equal to 0, and then factor it, and set each factor equal to 0. So we'll have

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:25,806
2x plus 5 equal 0 and x minus 3 equals 0. When we solve for the values of x, we

6
00:00:25,806 --> 00:00:30,894
see that x can equal negative 5 halves or x can equal 3. We'll use the values

7
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:34,170
of negative 5 halves in positive 3 to set up our three intervals on our number

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,840
line. These two values make this left side of our inequality equal to 0. So, we

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,954
want to test other values, so that way, this left-hand side is less than 0. If

10
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:50,346
we let x equal negative 5 in interval I, we get the statement 40 is less than

11
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:56,848
0. We know this is not true, so this interval or this region is out. No values

12
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:02,268
in here satisfy our inequality. For the second interval, we'll test the value

13
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:07,102
of 0, since that's in between negative 5 halves and positive 3. If x equals 0,

14
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:12,950
we plug it in and we get the statement that negative 15 is less than 0. Well,

15
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:18,365
this is true, so this part is part of the solution set. And finally, for our

16
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:22,772
third interval, we just need to test a number greater than 3. If I let x equal

17
00:01:22,772 --> 00:01:28,360
5, I get the statement 30 is less than 0. This is not true, so again, this part

18
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,098
is out of my solution set. These are the only values that make the inequality

19
00:01:33,098 --> 00:01:38,230
true. We use parentheses at negative 5 halves and positive 3, since we can't

20
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:43,568
equal 0. We must be less than 0. Again, fantastic work if you got most of that

21
00:01:43,568 --> 00:01:46,860
solution correct. These are tough.
