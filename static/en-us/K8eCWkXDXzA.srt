00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,830
Now let's get back to Athena's example for a second. Going through this long

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,370
division would have been really messy, so I've gone ahead and done it for you.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,842
What we end up with is still something that's not super pretty, but at least

4
00:00:10,842 --> 00:00:16,079
now you have the numbers. Considering this answer, what is the slant asymptote

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,966
of our function T? I've already written y equals for you, so just fill in an

6
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:22,923
expression on the right-hand side of the equation.
