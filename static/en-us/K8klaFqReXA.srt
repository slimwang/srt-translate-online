1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,380
Okay Michael, so
I think I have basically

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,410
one more thing that I want to say before
I start writing out little formulas and

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,680
trying to convince you that this
is something that we can do

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,100
with some of the framework and
infrastructure that we've built so far.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,900
And I want to do it by diving in and
sort of doubling down on this idea

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,920
drama management,
this idea of going through a story.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,920
So you're an AI person and you need to
kind of think about how you're going to

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,420
build a system where a player can
learn how to go through a story or

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,790
can go through a story and
have a good time.

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,190
So the first question I'm going to claim
you're going to have to ask yourself

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,520
is well, what's a story?

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,200
What's a story really?

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,710
And for the purposes of this discussion,
I'm going to just assert something and

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,050
you can tell me if it
makes sense to you.

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,270
And that is that a story,
it turns out, is just a trajectory.

16
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,970
It's just one of any possible many
number of possible trajectories

17
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,440
through a space that is
made up of plot points.

18
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,600
So, does that make any sense to you?

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,590
Do you know what I mean by that?

20
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,980
>> So you're being abstract
about what stories are.

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,300
Yes I'm being very abstract.

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,680
That abstraction is important
because we're computationalists.

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,220
>> And plot points, I guess plot points
makes me picture a graph where there's

24
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,920
points and there's edges or
there's vertices and there's edges.

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,060
So plot point is like a vertex?.

26
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:12,580
>> Yes, right.

27
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,400
So a plot point is like a little circle,
and that plot point might represent

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,330
something like, I don't know,
what's your favorite kind of story?

29
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:19,860
>> Mystery.

30
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,510
>> You like mysteries.

31
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,060
Okay cool.

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,570
So I have a plot point, that's something
that has to do with the mystery.

33
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,593
So what happens in a mystery?

34
00:01:25,593 --> 00:01:27,848
So there's a murder.

35
00:01:27,848 --> 00:01:29,590
What?
Yes that's a plot point.

36
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,280
There's another plot point maybe and

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,320
that plot point is
there's an accusation.

38
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,000
There's another plot point
which is a weapon is found.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,010
And there's a whole bunch of these and

40
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,050
if they're set up right and
they're sequenced just right if of all

41
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,960
the possible paths of all the possible
plot points were set up just right.

42
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,550
So you see the murder, you see the
accusation, a weapon is found and so on.

43
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,508
Then you have something that
looks like a murder mystery.

44
00:01:52,508 --> 00:01:56,200
Now I want to point out that it's
possible to have good murder mysteries

45
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,100
and bad murder mysteries.

46
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,480
So if you think about the way
a murder mystery works right,

47
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,690
it's got this really neat structure.

48
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,620
There's a murder.

49
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,910
Nobody knows who did it,
that's what makes it a mystery.

50
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:08,460
And then eventually you discover that,
every

51
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,370
single person in the house had a reason
to kill the person who was killed.

52
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,990
And you find a weapon that
points to a particular person.

53
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,925
>> It's, Michael.

54
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:20,694
>> [LAUGH]
>> Everyone know it's that person and

55
00:02:20,694 --> 00:02:22,080
then that person gets killed.

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,540
>> That's Michael again
>> No!

57
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,610
>> And then you know
therefore it wasn't Michael.

58
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,210
>> Or Curley.

59
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:31,120
>> And so, then you keep going And
you discover it was in fact not Curly.

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,040
And then you find out who
the real murderer is and

61
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,260
there's a whole bunch of things
that happen very quickly.

62
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,260
And it turns out it was
the butler all along.

63
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,470
>> That would've been my guess.

64
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,970
>> And
that makes it a good murder mystery.

65
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,300
Now here's a bad murder mystery.

66
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,385
There's a murder and you happen to see
it and so you know who the murderer is.

67
00:02:44,385 --> 00:02:47,030
>> [LAUGH].

68
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,350
>> So then a murderer has to go off and
start killing you and

69
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,540
everyone else they can.

70
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,900
You run away and
you know what you've got instead?

71
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,690
>> A chasing movie.

72
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,860
>> You've got a horror movie.

73
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,540
So the difference between a murder
mystery and a horror movie, and

74
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,490
not that much difference,

75
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,890
it's really about whether you know
who's doing the killing or not.

76
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,410
So if I have all these elements lined
up in some kind of virtual game.

77
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,240
Depending upon what the player of the
game is doing I may have to interfere,

78
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,980
interact with what's actually going
on underneath so that the player

79
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,470
experiences a murder mystery as opposed
to experiencing a horror flick.

80
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,370
>> And when you say you might have that,
you mean the drama manager.

81
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,270
>> Right, because the agent can describe
what it means to be a murder mystery.

82
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,260
And as a player,
the author can't control the players.

83
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,660
The player's going through.

84
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,680
The system may have to interact
with that in order to make

85
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,900
certain that you still get a good murder
mystery as opposed to something else.

86
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,620
And I'm going to claim that if we
think of these points as being key

87
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,710
things that happen in the story and
some sequences are better than others

88
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,280
then what we end up with
is a story is a trajectory.

89
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,280
It's a trajectory through
these plot points.

90
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,550
And that a good story is
a particular kind of trajectory.

91
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,360
And there are bad stories which
are other kinds of trajectories.

92
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,900
And we need to figure out
how to influence the player

93
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,150
in such a way that we go
down the good trajectories.

94
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,140
Instead of the bad trajectories.

95
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,540
>> And can you say a word about
what the player's doing here?

96
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,220
>> Well so
it would depend upon the situation.

97
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,210
But imagine that.

98
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,877
I mean you play games like Zork.

99
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:12,590
>> [LAUGH] Sure.

100
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,470
>> And various other things.

101
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,460
Right?

102
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,870
Sure you have vague memories of
Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.

103
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,930
And those like text adventure games.

104
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,300
You're interacting with the system
somehow and you decide to go north or

105
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,870
you decide to open the door,
you decide to talk to somebody.

106
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,480
It's just like you choose
your own adventure story,

107
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,660
that's the kind of idea that
I'm trying to evoke here.

108
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,740
>> Interesting.
Okay, and so

109
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,220
you're saying that we could think
of this as a kind of MDP and

110
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,050
then do reinforcement learning in it?

111
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,470
>> Yes,
that's what I'm going to talk about.

112
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,520
I want to convince you, if you buy this
idea of story, as trajectory with plot

113
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,370
points and it's actually pretty
easy to turn it into an MVP.

114
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,080
>> Okay,
I would like to hear about that.

115
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,660
>> Okay, let's do that.
