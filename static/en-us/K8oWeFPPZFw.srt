00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,590
There's one more useful aspect about declaring variables, namely comments. Have

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:11,030
a look at this variable declaration, we have a travelTime of 228 days. When you

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:16,390
read it you probably ask yourself, for which trip? Now I can tell you for which

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,880
trip, but when you write code it's very common that you look at your code

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,210
months or years later, or someone else looks at the code. And then they would

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,840
really like to know more of an explanation. In Java, we use comments to give

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,360
such an explanation. Notice, these 2 slashes, they are the comment marker.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,410
Anything that's after the slashes is ignored by the compiler. It's just there

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,930
for humans. To understand the code. You can write anything at all after the

10
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,190
comment marks, and the compiler won't care. But o course, if you write nonsense

11
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:58,355
like this, the humans who read your code may hate you. Comments are for humans.

12
00:00:58,355 --> 00:01:03,790
Use a comment whenever you need to explain something that might be difficult to

13
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,010
understand for the human reader.
