1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,640
Let's move up a dimension into
a three dimensional space and

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,320
let's start out by
thinking about planes.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,480
We're going to start by studying
planes in three dimensional space

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,520
because they are highly analogous
to lines in two dimensional space.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,951
Just like a single linear
equation Ax + By = k in codes

6
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:22,974
aligned in two dimensional space
A single linear equation Ax

7
00:00:22,974 --> 00:00:28,580
+ By + Cz = K encodes a plane
in three-dimensional space.

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:33,540
Another way to view the equation
Ax + By + Cz equals k

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,750
is like before,
a dot product of two vectors, A B C.

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,960
x y z = k.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,720
And like before with lines.

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,560
If we take A, B, C dot x, y, z = 0.

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,210
That means that vectors from
the origin to points x, y,

14
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,860
z in the plane are orthogonal
to the vector A, B, C.

15
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,390
Thus A, B,
C is a normal vector to the plane.

16
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,550
And also like with lines changing
the value of the constant term k

17
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,590
shifts the plane but it doesn't change
the direction of the plane at all.

18
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,597
So regardless of the constant
term the plane defined

19
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:19,440
by Ax + By + Cz = k has
ABC as a normal vector.

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,160
Let's call two planes with
parallel normal vectors parallel,

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,770
since their faces are in
the same direction.

22
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,342
If we have two parallel planes Ax +
By + Cz = k1 and Ax + By + Cz = k,

23
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:35,478
the same coefficients in
front of each variable but

24
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:40,768
different constant terms And
that means any point XYZ satisfying

25
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:46,190
the first equation can't satisfy
the second and vice versa.

26
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,560
So two different parallel
planes do not intersect.

27
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,640
This is just like the case
with lines in two dimensions,

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,540
two different lines with the same
normal vector don't intersect.

29
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,560
We also have another analogy to our
treatment of lines in two dimensions.

30
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,790
Remember that if we knew two lines were
parallel then we could check to see if

31
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:10,199
they were the same line by finding the
vector between a point on one line and

32
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,440
a point on the other.

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,710
If that vector was orthogonal to
each of the lines normal vectors

34
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,320
then the lines are the same.

35
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,660
Similarly if two planes are parallel
that is they have parallel normal

36
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,240
vectors then we can pick a point on one
plane and another point on the other.

37
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,930
If the vector connecting them is
orthogonal to the planes normal vectors

38
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,380
then the two planes must be the same.
