1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,720
Now that we have discussed means and

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:06,170
analysis in problem production, let's
revisit one of the problems that we

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,990
would encounter when we were talking
about the Raven's test of intelligence.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,940
So imagine that this is A and this is B.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,830
We can think of this as an initial
state and this as a goal state.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,950
We know that A has been
transformed into B.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,780
Now we can think in terms of
a sequence of operations,

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,810
that will transform this initial
state into the goal state.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,410
It is one sequence.

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,470
Delete it out,
then move the diamond out of the circle.

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,192
Then expanded out.

12
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:41,600
Let us now see, we can think of this
as an outward or means of analysis

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,022
because each move here, brings us
a little closer to the goal state.

14
00:00:46,022 --> 00:00:49,730
The advantage of doing this analysis and
coming up with a sequence of

15
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,460
transformations that will take us from
the initial state of goal state as that.

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,160
We cannot in [INAUDIBLE] of applying
the same set of transformations

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,270
to the image free, let's do that.

18
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,810
We'll apply one transformation at
a time, so we'll apply delete.

19
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,200
We delete the dot.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,010
Now we apply move to this state, and
it can give rise to several states.

21
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,160
We have shown two here.

22
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,710
Both of these spheres fulfill the
requirements of this move operation of

23
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,900
taking the diamond outside the circle.

24
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,560
And now for each of the states,
we can apply the operation of expand.

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,030
Here we are expanding the circle,

26
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,190
here too we are expanding the circle,
although with different amounts.

27
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,310
Once again the question here is,

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,900
what in the image A corresponds
to what in image C?

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,720
How do we know that
the diamond inside here

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,535
corresponds to the circle
inside the triangle here?

31
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:42,150
We'll discuss this in detail when we
discuss analogical reasoning, but for

32
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,480
now, here is a partial answer.

33
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,600
Remember that we had a semantic
network representation of the image A.

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,110
And in that representation, we said
that the diamond is inside the circle.

35
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,580
Now, we also have a semantic
network representation of image C.

36
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,820
And that semantic network representation
says that the circle is inside

37
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,730
the triangle.

38
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,290
But it's that inside
relationship that hints that

39
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,389
this circle must
correspond to the diamond.

40
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:14,270
Because here the diamond is inside and
here the circle is inside.

41
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,110
So note then, that their presentation
allows us to answer several questions

42
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,990
about similarity, about correspondence
and when we have metals, like means and

43
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,900
analysis then we can do a systematic
analysis of this transformations, and

44
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,250
try to transfer this set of
transformations to the new problem.

45
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,770
>> What's interesting is we can also see
this as an example of problem reduction.

46
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,160
We initially just had a big
problem that we had to solve.

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,230
But here,
we've reduced it to three subgoals.

48
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,106
Our first subgoal is to find
the transformation between A and B.

49
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:49,070
Our second subgoal, is to transfer
that transformation to C and

50
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,270
find some candidate states for D.

51
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,290
And our third subgoal, would be to
compare those candidate states for

52
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,930
D to each of the choices in our problem.

53
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,580
>> That's good analysis, David.

54
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,490
Let's go one step further.

55
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,850
This also has generated.

56
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,500
We are generating solutions that we can
then test against the various choices

57
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,199
that were given to us.

58
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,777
So in this particular problem,
you can see means and analysis working,

59
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:16,580
problem reduction working,
and the Raven's test working.

60
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:22,450
Often, solving the complex problem
requires a combination of AI techniques.

61
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,830
At one point,
one might use problem reduction.

62
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,832
At another point, one might use
the Raven's test, and at a third point,

63
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,249
one might use means and analysis.

64
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:34,540
Notice also, that the one single
knowledge representation of semantic

65
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,910
network supports all three
of these strategies.

66
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,190
The coupling between the knowledge
representation of semantic network, and

67
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,238
any of these three strategies,
problem reduction, means and analysis,

68
00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:46,850
and generating test is weak.

69
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,430
Later on we'll come across
methods in which knowledge and

70
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,560
the problem solving method
are closely coupled.

71
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,650
The knowledge affords
certain inferences, and

72
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,970
inferences demand certain
kinds of knowledge.

73
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,810
This is why these methods
are known as Weak Methods.

74
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,350
Because the coupling between
this universal method and

75
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,130
the knowledge representation is weak.
