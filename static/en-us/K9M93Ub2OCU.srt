1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,976
All right. 
We're just going to add

2
00:00:01,976 --> 00:00:03,982
a few more details to the app.

3
00:00:03,982 --> 00:00:06,740
We're going to implement 
a weather notification preference

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,660
We'll do this by adding a new preference
to the app settings

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,050
to turn off notifications.
And then, use that preference

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,640
to turn off the notification.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,650
Hint: you're going to want 
to use a CheckBoxPreference.
