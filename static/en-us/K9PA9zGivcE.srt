Sharing and accessing application
data is great for developers.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,190
In using a content provider,
it's a piece of cake to have your app

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,429
grab data, or write data to
a user's contacts, documents or

4
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:13,339
calendar, with only a few lines of code.

5
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:17,410
For example, let's say you're making
a new business card reader app.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,510
The goal is to have the user take
a picture of their business card with

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,550
their phone, and the app will
interpret the business card and

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,740
automatically add the contact
information to your phone's contacts.

9
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,219
Then the user can lose
the business card, but

10
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:33,750
they'll still have that hard
won networking information.

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,620
In order to make this app seamless for

12
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:40,509
users, you need to store the new contact
information in the same data source

13
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:43,229
the user's already using to store
their phone's contact data.

14
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:47,689
This is because this is where your
phone's default contact app looks for

15
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:49,169
contact information to display.

16
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:53,409
Now usually data sources
like a SQLite database

17
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:55,179
are private to the app
which created them.

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,490
This is done for security reasons.

19
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,520
So how do two totally
different apps easily read and

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,880
write for the same data source?

21
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,380
This is where content providers come in.

22
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:10,614
In short, a content provider is a class
that sits between an application and

23
00:01:10,614 --> 00:01:12,325
its data source, and

24
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:16,349
its job is to provide easily managed
access to the underlying data source.
