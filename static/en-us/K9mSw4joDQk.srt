1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,660
Having correlation between
our predictor variables,

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,170
will not cause much issue during the
building of a classification model, but

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,235
will cause issues during
the prediction time.

4
00:00:11,235 --> 00:00:15,580
Let's go through the list of potential
predictor variables and use logic and

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,489
correlation to remove duplicate or
inter-correlated variables.

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,940
If we look at the top two most
associated variables to churn,

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,050
they are total day in minutes and
total day in charges.

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,080
If we logically think about it,
I would assume that

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,280
the amount a person is charged on
their phone bill for daytime calls

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,850
would be directly related to how many
minutes they talked during the day.

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,570
On the left side, we have
a correlation matrix that visually

12
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,470
represents the Pearson correlation
values between the different variables.

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,570
If we look at this,
we can see the total day charge and

14
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,130
the total day minutes has
a very bright red block,

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,760
meaning those variables
are highly positively correlated.

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,110
The values associated with
it are also 1, meaning,

17
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,140
they're perfect positive correlators.

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,676
To go even further, in the scatterplot
on the right hand side,

19
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:13,880
that you can see as
the total.day.minutes increases,

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,100
the total.day.charges moves
exactly in parallel with it.

21
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,500
I would say that not only are these
variables inter-correlated,

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,110
but they are duplicate variables.

23
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,420
With this being said,
we should remove one of the variables,

24
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,310
since they are redundant.

25
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,910
And having these duplicate
fields will cause

26
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,060
errors during the prediction
time of the analysis.

27
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,960
Looking at the list of potential
predictor variables again,

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,210
since the total.day.minutes field has
a slightly greater association to

29
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,740
turn than the total.day.charge field,

30
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,940
I will keep that field and
remove the total.day.charge field.

31
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,880
Let us now look at the full heat plot of
all the variables against each other.

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,150
By looking at the full graph,
I'm scoping out three things.

33
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,100
One, where are very red blocks?

34
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:06,050
These very red blocks represent highly
positively correlated variables.

35
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,470
The second thing I'm looking for, are
very blue boxes which represent highly

36
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,550
negative correlation between variables.

37
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,720
The third thing I'm looking for,
is little to no color,

38
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,840
what this represents is little
correlation between our variables.

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Now we'll observe variables that
have very little correlation,

40
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,120
since these are the variables that
can be used as predictors together,

41
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,110
since they have very
little inter-correlation.

42
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,396
If we look at the total.intl.minutes
versus the total.eve.minutes

43
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:42,381
we can see that the correlation between
the two variables is very low at 0.02.

44
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:46,518
In the scatterplot,
we see no patterns and total randomness,

45
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:51,690
meaning that the movement in one
field does not effect the other.

46
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,820
This is exactly what we are wanting
in our predictor variables.
