1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,190
The correct answer is that
likely the event-driven

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,060
model will consume least resources.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,150
Recall that in the other models,
we had a separate thread for

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,308
each of the requests or for
each of the pipeline stages.

5
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:15,120
In the event-driven model,

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,000
we have handlers which are just
procedures in that address space, and

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,098
the helper threads only occur for
blocking I operations.

8
00:00:22,098 --> 00:00:26,640
For the event-driven model,
extra memory is required only for

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,478
the helper threads that are associated
with concurrent blocking I/O calls.

10
00:00:31,478 --> 00:00:36,150
In the boss-worker model,
extra memory will be required for

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,670
threads for all concurrent requests, and
similarly, even in the pipeline model,

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,490
concurrent requests will demand multiple
threads to be available in a stage of

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:53,330
the pipeline if the level of concurrency
is beyond the number of pipeline stages.

14
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:53,980
As a result,

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,360
the event-driven model will likely
have the smallest memory footprint.
