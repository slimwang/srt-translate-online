00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,430
Now that we have looked at learning curves,

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,340
let's look at another performance metric, the accuracy.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,130
In case of a classifier,

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,050
the accuracy is the fraction of predictions that are correct.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:17,880
By correct, we mean the negative instances are classified as negative,

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,420
and the positive instances are classified as positive.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,390
The loss function, in this case, is a 0, 1 loss.

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,440
The risk is given by the misclassification error.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,980
Another way to look at this,

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,050
is simply to count the number of times our model correctly classified our data.

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,070
So, the accuracy of a classifier can be given as the sum of the true

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:48,040
positives and the true negatives, divided by the total number of occurrences.
