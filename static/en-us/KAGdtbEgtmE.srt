1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,050
All right, you're done. 
There were a lot of new things

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,990
that time. 
But, after all,

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,530
you're becoming a seasoned 
Android programmer by now.

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,430
As I mentioned before, 
we're going to use

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,520
NotificationCompat.Builder 
to build our notification.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,000
It's easy to build a nice looking 
notification that has our icon

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,220
representing the weather forecast, 
the title for our app.

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,330
And our content text, the forecast 
with highs and lows.

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,600
We're going to use another class

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,130
from the support library, 
to create a task stack builder

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,960
for our pending intent. 
This is a simple case

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,880
of task stack builder, 
because all we have

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,710
is a single item on our stack. 
We just add the next intent

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,700
and use it to build out pending intent

15
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,480
that we pass 
into the notification manager.

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,150
Finally we call the notification manager 
with the built intent from our builder,

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,088
with a notify function. 
One of the great things

18
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:56,964
about notification manager 
is it can be used from any thread

19
00:00:56,964 --> 00:00:58,948
even though it is displaying UI.
