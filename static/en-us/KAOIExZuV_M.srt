00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,196
So now we have that our population parameters are about 13 for the mean and 4.8

2
00:00:05,196 --> 00:00:10,708
for the standard deviation. And remember the units are average karma points per

3
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:15,932
post. Using these rounded values, let's draw our distribution. We're going to

4
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:21,321
say that it's normal so here's our theoretical probability density function. And

5
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:26,879
here where the mean, equals the median, equals the mode, we have 13. Let's say

6
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:32,261
here's one standard deviation above the mean, and here's standard deviation less

7
00:00:32,261 --> 00:00:37,560
than the mean. And here's two standard deviations. If our standard deviation is

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,726
4.8, then what should our values be here, here, here, and here?
