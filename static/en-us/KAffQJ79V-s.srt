00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,738
We know that the ratio for the parchment is 0.795 times the ratio for plants

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:12,114
today, which is 1 in 10 to the 12th. So we need to multiply 0.795 times 1 over

3
00:00:12,114 --> 00:00:19,385
10 to the 12th. Now this number is just 10 to the negative 12. So we have 0.795

4
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:23,093
times 10 to the negative 12.
