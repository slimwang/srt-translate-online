1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,960
Remember when you learned about for loops, if statements, functions?

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,810
Those are fundamental concepts in programming, and if you're

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,430
ever writing code in other languages, you'll see these concepts again and again.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,980
Now, the same goes for certain concepts with code organizations.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,280
Here are some of those main concepts that you'll see over and over again.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,950
The first on our list of fundamental organizational concepts is models.

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,140
Now, we've already talked at these.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,030
Models just represent your data,

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,680
and models can be stupid, like a JavaScript object literal as shown here.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,320
Or they can be more intelligent, as in most other organizational frameworks, and

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,280
as we'll see in a bit.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,060
Next, we have collections.

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,110
Collections are basically smart arrays.

14
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,740
And what are they filled with?

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,750
Models.

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,740
Now, remember, models are just data.

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,710
Even if they're intelligent models, they still represent data.

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,070
So, collections of models are collections of data,

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,210
just like our cats array in the previous lesson, but a little bit smarter.

20
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,629
Now, we've talked about octopuses at length, but if you bring them up

21
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,230
to any other developer, they won't know what you're talking about.

22
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:13,070
Octopuses in the real world are called things like controllers or view models.

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,770
Here's another thing we've already talked about in-depth before.

24
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,360
Views are the things that draw the interface and

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,700
allow the user to interact with the interface.

26
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,410
We also have a similar thing called routers.

27
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,420
Now, this is new to you technically, but only kind of.

28
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:37,180
Routers keep track of the state of the URL, which in a way is a view-like thing.

29
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,990
The URL is something that the user can interact with and see.

30
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,540
Often, routers are used to track the state of the application.

31
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,960
Now, we're not going to get into routers in any more depth than this,

32
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,040
just conceptually.

33
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,160
But just know that they're very similar to views, just for the URL bar up here.

34
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,070
Don't be afraid of them.

35
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,110
If you can understand views, you can understand routers.

36
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,210
Now, organizational libraries often look very different from each other.

37
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,280
But no matter which you use,

38
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,820
you generally see these same five things over and over and over again.

39
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,500
The concepts are all the same, and

40
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,570
that means once we have a solid understanding of these basic concepts,

41
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,920
we can feel empowered to learn new organizational libraries.
