1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,310
The first and most obvious of
all of the pricing strategies,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,150
is simply to have a paid apper game.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,077
This generally appears like it's
going to be a minimum amount of

4
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:16,565
revenue that you'll obtain, but
the outcome isn't always as clear.

5
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:19,294
When you're deciding to do a paid app or
a paid game,

6
00:00:19,294 --> 00:00:22,891
make sure that the quality is extremely
high because people are going

7
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:24,890
to expect this for this type of an app.

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,460
If you're just testing out your MVP,
the minimum viable product,

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,549
and you don't necessarily know where
it lies on the quality spectrum.

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,410
Then you might want to choose
a different modulation method.

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,490
With choosing a paid method, so

12
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,930
this is outright paid, it's best
to look at all of the different

13
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,970
types of similarly paid apps or games
to determine the best pricing strategy.

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:55,120
This might vary from country to
country or from time of year.

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,520
For instance, if you want to get
a lot of users very quickly and

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,550
you're not too worried about
the return during the holidays,

17
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,420
you might want to lower a price point.

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,110
If it's during the summer and
you don't really see like a huge rush,

19
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,090
maybe it's a better idea
to price it a bit more.

20
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,270
Of course, having a paid app or

21
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,380
game doesn't mean that
you also can't have IAPs.

22
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,250
Or ads.

23
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,800
But, you have to be extremely
careful not to overdo it on

24
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,590
those types of things, because there can
be push back from your users or players.

25
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:32,390
There is no best choice between
interstitials that deliver CPC or CPI.

26
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,870
It really depends on what's
converting the best in the end.
