00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,200
Wonderful.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,190
These functions are each fairly small.

3
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:08,029
And you'll be including this code in
every app that uses location services.

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,720
The version I wrote begins with onStart.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,440
This simply connects
the GoogleApiClient to the services

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,219
by calling the connect method.

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,260
Next, we also see onStop.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,750
So, if something happens that stops
the client from accessing the services,

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,030
it disconnects.

10
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,120
And you should explicitly
disconnect it in the onStop method.
