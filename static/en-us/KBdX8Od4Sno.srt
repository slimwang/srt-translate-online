Here's an exercise to

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,560
encourage you to carefully
consider the reduction just given.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,610
We interpreted the rows of the table
we constructed as the base

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,310
ten representation of the collection
of numbers that the reduction output.

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,560
What other bases would
have worked as well?

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,270
Check all that apply.
