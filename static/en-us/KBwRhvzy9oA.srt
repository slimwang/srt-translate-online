Let's now take a quick look at BGP route selection. It is often the case that

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,060
a router on a particular autonomous system might

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,720
learn multiple routes to the same destination. In this

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,580
case, a router on autonomous system one, might

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,860
learn a route to a destination in AS4

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,730
via both AS2 and AS3. In this situation.

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,010
The router in AS one must select a single

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,710
best route to the destination among the

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,070
choices. The selection among multiple alternatives is known

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,160
as the BGP route selection process. Let's now take a quick look at that process.
