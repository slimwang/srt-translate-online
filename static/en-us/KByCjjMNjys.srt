00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,210
I think it's time to move past
simple cosmetic changes to the site.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,010
So far, you've used media
queries to change simple things,

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,110
like background color and what not,

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,150
but you can also you use media queries
to change the entire layout of the page.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,360
In fact, this is how developers
accomplish responsive design.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,640
By using media queries like min-width and

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,310
max-width, developers can change
the entire layout of the page.

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,030
>> Right, the point at which the page
changes layout, is called a break point.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,040
And depending on how
your site is laid out,

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,040
you might have one or
several break points.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,390
>> You know what, let's take a look at a
few examples of pages using breakpoints.

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,480
Afterwards, I'll show you
a few more pages, and

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,490
you tell me,
how many breakpoints they've used.
