1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,290
The structure of this course will likely
change a bit from semester to semester.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,170
After all, we hope to learn and
improve the course over time.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,415
But there's an overarching structure
that we anticipate staying fairly

4
00:00:09,415 --> 00:00:10,710
consistent.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,050
You'll start the course by really
getting into an intense phase of study

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,120
in the field that you're most interested
in within educational technology.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,780
You'll answer some reflective questions.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,700
You'll go out and
find your own resources.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,050
And you'll really develop
a mastery of that topic.

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,562
At the end of that stage, you'll be
asked to demonstrate that mastery with

11
00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:28,920
a custom question written just for
you to answer.

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,120
To demonstrate that you can
really think in this field,

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,420
you can contribute to this community.

14
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,300
Then it's time to propose your project.

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,430
You'll work with your mentor
to scope out your plan for

16
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,170
the rest of the semester and decide how
you're going to bring your idea to life.

17
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,270
At this point, you might also
decide to work in a group and

18
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,850
tackle a big problem as a team, instead
of small problems as individuals.

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,240
Then it's time to work
on your project and

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,990
you'll spend the rest of
the semester working on it and

21
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,710
delivering weekly reports
on how you're progressing.

22
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,080
You'll talk to your mentor a lot during
this phase to get their constant

23
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,520
feedback and evaluate how
the project is coming together.

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,220
And then at the end of the semester,
you'll deliver the project, a paper and

25
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:03,870
a presentation.

26
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,800
So that you can share your ideas,
both with your classmates and

27
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,290
potentially, with the broader
field of educational technology.

28
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,830
The goal is that your
project won't end there.

29
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,850
We hope that this is just
a jumping off point for

30
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,730
something that you'll continue
to work on going forward.
