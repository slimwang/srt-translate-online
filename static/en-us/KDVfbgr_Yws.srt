1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,220
Here’s a graph and
its corresponding adjacency matrix.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,910
Now suppose 1 and 6 are in the frontier.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,670
Which vertices might need to be updated?

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,150
Here’s an update vector.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,760
I want you to mark the entries
of the update vector u

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,140
that might become part
of the next frontier.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,420
Do that by typing a 1 in
the appropriate entries.
