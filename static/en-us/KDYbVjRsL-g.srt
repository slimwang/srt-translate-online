00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,970
So before we go any further,

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,077
let me ask you one question based
on what we've learned so far.

3
00:00:06,077 --> 00:00:11,120
Which of the following do you think
are virtualization requirements?

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,719
Here are some possible choices.

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,759
Present the virtual platform
interface to the guest VMs.

6
00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:20,000
Provide isolation across the guest VMs.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,959
Protect the guest operating system from
the applications that are running in

8
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:25,500
the VM.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,041
Protect the hypervisor or

10
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:31,300
the virtual machine monitor from
the guest operating system.

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,300
Among these choices, you should
check all of the ones that apply.
