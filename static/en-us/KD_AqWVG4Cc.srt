00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,266
If we split 0.001 in half, then we get 0.0005. So that's the probability in

2
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:13,708
each tail. So if we look at our z table and look for 0.0005, we get about

3
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:22,700
negative 3.32. So again that means that this z critical value is negative 3.32.

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,159
And this z critical value is positive 3.32. Great job calculating those z

5
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:30,242
critical values for both one and two tail.
