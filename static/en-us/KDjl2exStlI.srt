1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,880
A powerful category of connector are arbitrators.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,220
These are primarily responsible for facilitation services, but

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,300
because they can redirect control there's also a coordination service they

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,820
provide. You might be able to use them to negotiate service levels.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,590
That is how much resources are being devoted to a particular problem.

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,200
Hence they support reliability and atomicity, scheduling and

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,020
load balancing, trapping of faults and even synchronization.

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,790
Some of the variations for arbitrator connectors include how they handle faults.

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:43,250
Typically with a simple arbitrator scheme, there's a single decision made but

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:49,290
more complex systems might involve a voting scheme. That is if there are three

11
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,520
arbitrators around, they would have to vote on the course of action and

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,560
the majority would rule. How concurrency is dealt with. The mechanism is it

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,880
semi fours, a rendezvous, monitors, locks there's lots of approaches to this.

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,900
And whether it's a light weight approach or a heavy weight approach.

15
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,230
Variations involved with transactions such as whether they're simple or

16
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:14,246
they're nested. Whether the arbitrator is there if you need it or is required.

17
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:20,300
And whether the arbitrator supports reads, writes, or both. And

18
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,760
then a major category of, of capabilities and variation of arbitrators involves

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,600
security. Authentication, authorization, screening, durability that

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,860
is how long the particular decision last. Is it a single session, or

21
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,860
is it a multi session? And then the scheduling of the arbitrator activities.
