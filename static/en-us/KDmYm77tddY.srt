00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,584
Lets evaluate each side of each equation, starting with this one up here. Log

2
00:00:04,584 --> 00:00:10,486
base 10 of 100 is 2, and log base 10 of 1000 is 3. So, we have 2 over 3 for

3
00:00:10,486 --> 00:00:16,271
this side. On the right-hand side we have log base 10 of 100 again, or 2, and

4
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:23,740
then, minus 3 for log base 10 of 1000, this equals negative 1. Unfortunately

5
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,520
for this equation, two thirds is not equal to negative 1, so this is not a true

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,101
statement, we need to put a not equals sign here. Let's move over here to this

7
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:39,232
equation. The left-hand side right now is log base 10 of 100 over 1000. So lets

8
00:00:39,232 --> 00:00:43,172
look at whats inside the parentheses and simplify that. 100 over 1000 is 1 over

9
00:00:43,172 --> 00:00:49,314
10 and 1 over 10 is the same as 10 to the negative 1. Log base 10 of 10 to the

10
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:54,643
negative 1 is just negative 1. Great. What about the right-hand side? Well this

11
00:00:54,643 --> 00:00:59,062
is the same as what we had over here. And we got negative 1 for that. Sure

12
00:00:59,062 --> 00:01:04,090
enough negative 1 is equal to negative 1. So, this equation is true. Awesome.

13
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:08,310
Now what about this last one here? Well, once again lets start with what's

14
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,953
inside the parentheses here. We have log base 10 of 100 minus 1000. Which is

15
00:01:13,953 --> 00:01:18,585
the same as log base 10 of negative 900. Hm, I'm not sure what this is so how

16
00:01:18,585 --> 00:01:23,891
about I pull out the calculator and we'll see what this equals. So we have log

17
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:30,134
base 10 of negative 900, and look at that we get an error. I wonder why that

18
00:01:30,134 --> 00:01:34,795
is? Well actually, we know why. We're trying to take the log of a negative

19
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:38,978
number, and you learned before that, that is not allowed. This is just not

20
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:43,270
equal to a real number. On the right-hand side, we have what we had over here,

21
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,621
two thirds. Well, two thirds is a real number, so that means this equation is

22
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:53,636
not true. This second one, log base 10 of 100 over 1000, is equal to log base

23
00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:59,881
10 of 100, minus log base 10 of 1000. Is the only example of the quotient rule

24
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:04,659
being used properly of these three equations. This is a great check to show

25
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:08,756
that the quotient property actually works. And I hope it's also pointed out

26
00:02:08,756 --> 00:02:12,340
some easy ways that you might accidently make a mistake when you're trying to

27
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,959
use it.
