00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,220
As an entrepreneur, when should I
start thinking about the Hook Model?

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,050
>> As early as possible.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,430
Because the idea here is, well,
I'll tell you a personal story.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,335
So I've been at two companies.

5
00:00:12,335 --> 00:00:17,180
One of my,
at the last startup that I helped found,

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,860
one of the problems we constantly
had was what do we build?

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,530
So, we were big believers in the lean
start methodology of build, measure,

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,480
learn, customer development,
big believers in that.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,460
Still am.

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,090
But we always had this challenge
of what do we build next, right?

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,590
This is where all the blood,
sweat, and tears and money all go,

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,850
it's the building.

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,510
Testing and learning, measuring and
learning, that's easy, that's fun.

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,770
>> Right.
>> It's the building that's hard.

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,000
So the question we constantly,
constantly had was,

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,310
you know what do we build next?

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,320
Do we build what the VCs
say we should build?

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,950
Do we build what the loudest
customer say what we should build?

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,000
Do we build what people who write into
customer support say we should build?

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,070
What do we build?

21
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,270
And so, what I, what I propose is that
instead of just guessing, or you know,

22
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,740
taking a shot at, or dot voting,
even, based on what the team thinks

23
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,720
we need some kind of framework based on
how people actually behave because it

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,840
turns out that just asking people what
they want is not a really great measure.

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,680
Because people can only
articulate certain things.

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,860
There's all these inarticulatable
needs that drive our behavior and

27
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,510
people couldn't tell you
actually drive their behavior.

28
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,230
>> Right.
>> So instead of just guessing we need

29
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,490
consumer psychology to help us
build the right things sooner.

30
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,430
We still have to do build,
measure, learn.

31
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,610
We're still going to mess up,

32
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,180
we're not going to build perfect
products the first time.

33
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,960
The idea is that we can
build the right thing sooner

34
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,200
by basing what we build on
the foundations of consumer psychology.
