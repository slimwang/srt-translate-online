1
00:00:01,345 --> 00:00:04,010
So, all of this conversation
just got me thinking.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:09,110
It would be so much simpler if the off
variable just had the email embedded it,

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,205
instead of limiting us to just
having the UID of the provider.

4
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:16,761
I've heard about custom tokens,
not really sure what they are.

5
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:19,870
Can I use that to my
advantage in some way?

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,638
>> Yeah,
that would solve a lot of this problem.

7
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:22,640
>> Cool.
>> Yeah,

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,284
if only I had told you that sooner.

9
00:00:25,284 --> 00:00:26,867
>> [LAUGH]
>> But, no,

10
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:30,577
what you would do is you would need to
mint a custom token, as it's called.

11
00:00:30,577 --> 00:00:32,506
And essentially, what that means is,

12
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:36,187
we have all kinds of libraries that you
can use on a trusted environment, so

13
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:38,828
that you don't ude on
the Android device of the user.

14
00:00:38,828 --> 00:00:42,078
But you can run them on pretty
much any server environment or

15
00:00:42,078 --> 00:00:43,900
any other trusted environment.

16
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,137
Essentially, you'd get to encode
whatever information you want and

17
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:50,934
you sign it with the secret
of your fire base and

18
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:54,617
you then use that as the off
variable in your security rules.

19
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:58,196
And that means that you can put
any information you want in there.

20
00:00:58,196 --> 00:01:02,637
So if you've already verified the user's
email address, for example, you can just

21
00:01:02,637 --> 00:01:06,214
put it in there and then in your
security rules you can say auth.email

22
00:01:06,214 --> 00:01:09,997
and use it directly instead of having
to load it from your mapping table.

23
00:01:09,997 --> 00:01:12,009
>> That actually sounds pretty awesome.

24
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:16,681
Are there, so this seems like something
that people probably do fairly commonly.

25
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:20,049
Are there any sort of prepackaged or
third-party options or

26
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:23,481
options that you would suggest
that already could get me up and

27
00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:26,137
running with creating
custom tokens quickly.

28
00:01:26,137 --> 00:01:30,803
>> Yeah, definitely, so for custom
tokens, typically if you have your own

29
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:35,027
existing user table then you need
to start making your own tokens.

30
00:01:35,027 --> 00:01:39,460
But if you want to integrate with all
kinds of existing like social providers

31
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,606
like to Google or Facebook but also,

32
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:44,947
provider's firebase doesn't
support like Linked In.

33
00:01:44,947 --> 00:01:47,548
And then you could choose Alt zero and
date.

34
00:01:47,548 --> 00:01:50,086
Essentially, means
the question taken for you and

35
00:01:50,086 --> 00:01:53,460
provide a lot more information to
the author board that you can use.

36
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,099
>> Okay.

37
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:54,952
Cool.

38
00:01:54,952 --> 00:01:59,970
So basically what I'm hearing, is that
I could run a tiny bit of server code

39
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:05,162
on even my own Android phone, but will
probably somewhere better than that.

40
00:02:05,162 --> 00:02:07,962
And then that would verify that
the users are actually own the email

41
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,620
addresses that they say that they own.

42
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,610
And that I could use a service
like auth zero to then attach

43
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,210
that email address to the off token and
easily use it throughout my rules.

44
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,610
>> Yeah.

45
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,370
>> Well Puff that sounds like a plan.

46
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,320
So, thanks for
taking the time to talk to us today,

47
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,437
I'm sure you have important
things to get to at Google.

48
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,410
The funny thing is,
that before we started talking I

49
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,280
really was not a security believer, I
didn't think it was that big of a deal.

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,360
But what I'm realizing is
that security is something

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,450
that you need to be thinking about even
at the stage that you're thinking about

52
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,730
how your data is going to be organized,
and it's super important to get right.

53
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,720
So, thank you so much for
showing me that.

54
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,340
>> No, thanks for
allowing me to explain this,

55
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,420
because indeed security is
very important with Firebase.

56
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,110
Right when you start data modeling,
as you say,

57
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,920
you must also figure out how you
want to secure the database.

58
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,806
Because if you don't, you never know who
you can trust in this world, do you?

59
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:02,979
[SOUND]
