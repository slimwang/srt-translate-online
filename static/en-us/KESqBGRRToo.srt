1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,520
These attacks can have serious negative effects,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,240
including theft of confidential information, unauthorized use

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,660
of network bandwidth or computing resources, the

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,910
spread of false information, and the disruption of

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,850
legitimate services. All these types of attack

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,810
are related. They are all very dangerous

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,400
and sometimes they come hand in hand.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,450
For example, all these attacks are, in some

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,940
sense, related to one another. And, they can

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,390
come hand in hand with one another as well.
