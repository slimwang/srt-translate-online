[Norvig] Part of the problem with this approach is that it's not guaranteed to terminate.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Another part of it is that even when it does terminate,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
it's going to take a little bit longer to do so.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And the question is, how long is it going to take?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Assume we have N elements in our deck.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How long is it going to take for this algorithm to run?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Would it be roughly on the order of N swaps

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
or roughly on the order of N squared swaps

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
or roughly on the order of N factorial swaps?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Which of those do you think corresponds to the time it will take on average

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to execute this algorithm?
