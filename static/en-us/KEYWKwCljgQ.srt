00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,260
onConnectionFailed is pretty complex and

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,939
in many ways is the workhorse
of your application.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,750
So in it you've just got to be
careful to manage all your states.

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,590
First of all,
you're going to use an intent, so

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,735
create an intent on the activity and
call it mSignInIntent.

6
00:00:13,735 --> 00:00:16,470
Also create an integer that
you call mSignInInteger.

7
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:19,755
So when you create
the onConnectionFailed,

8
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:23,895
be sure to override it and it takes
a connection result called result.

9
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:26,445
Then you're going to need to
check your sign in progress, and

10
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:29,365
if its not STATE_IN_PROGRESS,

11
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:34,690
then set the intent that you've
created to result.getResolution().

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:39,510
If it is STATE_SIGN_IN, then you'll
just want to call resolveSignInError(),

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,330
which you will be writing shortly.

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,780
Otherwise, you're going to
call onSignedOut(),

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,740
because you're actually signed out.

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,670
Implement this functionality, including
the onConnectionFailed override and

17
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,750
check this box when you're done.

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,680
OnConnectionFailed is pretty complex and

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,360
in many ways is the workhorse
of your application.

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,160
So in it you just gotta be careful
to manage all your states.

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,000
First of all,
you're going to use an intent, so

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,150
create an intent on the activity,
and call it mSignInIntent.

23
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,890
Also create an integer that
you call mSignInInteger.

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,200
So when you create
the onConnectionFailed,

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,300
be sure to override it, and it takes
a ConnectionResult called result.

26
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,770
Then you're going to need to
check your sign in progress.

27
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,780
And if it's not STATE_IN_PROGRESS,

28
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:26,110
then set the intent that you've
created to result.getResolution().

29
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,920
If it is STATE_SIGN_IN, then you'll
just want to call resolveSignInError(),

30
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,750
which you'll be writing shortly.

31
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,690
Otherwise you're going to call
onSignedOut() because you're

32
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,160
actually signed out.

33
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,080
Implement this functionality, including
the onConnectionFailed override, and

34
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,130
check this box when you're done.
