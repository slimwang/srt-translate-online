1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,313
So, let's look at what kind of structures and what

2
00:00:02,313 --> 00:00:04,680
do we have in the hardware with the ROB. So,

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,485
we still have the instruction queue, from which we dispatch

4
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:11,180
into the reservation stations. We still have the RAT, that can

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,715
point to a register file, or to the rename name

6
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:17,430
for the instruction until it writes to the register file.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,311
But RAT entries that point to, not to register file

8
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:25,540
in, in normal Tomasulo's algorithm would point to the reservation stations.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,270
Now, however, we have a new structure called the

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,280
reorder buffer, or ROB. It has a head and tail

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,950
pointer, and basically the instructions that are currently in

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,924
execution are between these two pointers. The head pointer is

13
00:00:37,924 --> 00:00:40,366
the pointer to where we are going to put the

14
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:44,051
next instruction that issues. The tail pointer is where we

15
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:47,468
are considering instructions for commit and the RAT entries

16
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:50,550
that are not pointing register file are now pointing to

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,080
the ROB entries for the instructions that are going to produce its value.
