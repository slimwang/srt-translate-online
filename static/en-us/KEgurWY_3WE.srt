1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Obviously, the middle one showed something like hydraulic pressure.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The driver pushed the brake better and then the electronics modulates that value at a constant slope.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The lower one has to be the wheel slip. As you brake stronger, the wheel slip increases.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
As the system decreases the pressure, the wheel slip eventually starts to drop again.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The upper one has to be the velocity of the rim of the wheel.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
When the wheel slip is slow, the velocity of the rim of the wheel is large,

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
approximately the velocity of the car.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
When the wheel slip is high, the velocity of the rim of the wheel has to be low.
