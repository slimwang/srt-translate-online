00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,460
Let's take one more look at how
Apple Maps would respond in the face of

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,950
network problems.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,210
Just like the last exercise, I'm running
Apple Maps with no network connection.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,420
But this time, let's say I
want to post a pin to the map.

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,730
What will Apple Maps do in this
scenario when I try placing a pin and

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,830
we have 100% packet loss?

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,410
Will Maps allow me to drop a blank pin?

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,210
Or maybe Maps won't let
me drop a pin at all.

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,030
Will Maps show an alert?

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,340
Or the worst case scenario,
will maps crash?

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,570
Put a check next to your answer.
