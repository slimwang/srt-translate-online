1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
This installation comes in two parts.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,920
First, we're going to install something
called the Java Development Kit and

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,970
only once we're done with that,
then will we install Android Studio.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,030
I want you to think of
Android Studio like a workshop.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,050
And this is a pretty special workshop
because it's specifically designed for

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,980
making Android applications.

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,660
One where we have automated help
that makes creating apps easier.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,630
The thing is, that while this workshop
is great, it's pretty useless without

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,320
tools and that's where
the Java Development Kit comes in.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,400
Before we set anything else up, first
we'll install the Java Development Kit.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,630
Essentially we're grabbing our tools.

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,820
Then we set up our app making workshop
by installing Android Studio.

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,460
Now it's important that you
do these steps in order and

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,800
complete them correctly.

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,560
If you don't have your tools ready then
you won't be able to do anything in

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,040
your workshop.

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,250
The whole process of setting both of
these up, should take you about 30

18
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,980
minutes to an hour if your
Internet connection is fast.

19
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,840
Okay, let's get started.
