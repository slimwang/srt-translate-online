1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
So what does this mean for the problem sizes that we can expect to handle?

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,740
I'm going to give you a little quiz here so that you can develop a feeling for that.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,720
Assume that we want to consider, at most, 1 billion possible solutions

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:17,210
for an NP complete problem, 1 billion different assignments of 0 and 1 to the vertices.

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,810
So what I would like you to do is to figure out the maximum problem size that we can handle

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,270
using these best known search trees under this condition here.

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,640
We want to consider, at most, 1 billion different solutions.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,720
So please enter your answer here in these boxes.

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,150
What I would like you to do for this box here is use this algorithm.

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,000
For this box here I would like you to use this one here.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,290
And for comparison I would like you to figure out 2 more.

12
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,410
One is 1.1 to the power of N, and one is 2 to the power of N.

13
00:00:45,410 --> 99:59:59,999
So there's actually 5 different answers here.
