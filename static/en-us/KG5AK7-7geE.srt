1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,890
So no matter where you are, that is, no
matter what your shell's current working

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,540
directory is, you can give a file's
path as either an absolute path

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,650
from the root, or you can use a relative
path from the current working directory.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,090
For this quiz, let's say you're
currently in /home/otter.

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,720
Here are five pairs of cd commands.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,760
For each pair,

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,610
figure out whether the two commands
will change the same working directory.

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,650
This first pair is an example.

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,720
If you're in /home/otter and
you do a cd That will

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,810
take you to the current working
directory's parent which is /home.

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,490
That's the same result as cd /home.

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,199
So yes, this first pair matches.

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,690
Try the next row on your own.

14
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,401
Remember, in each case your initial
working directory is /home/otter,

15
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:49,319
right here.
