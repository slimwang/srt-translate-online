1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,848
>> For the first one, we plug in 3, in for x. So I have negative 2 times 3 plus

2
00:00:05,848 --> 00:00:11,853
7. So I get negative 6 plus 7, which is 1. For the next one, I plug in 0 for x.

3
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:17,252
And I wind up with 7. For f of negative 2, I plug in negative 2 for my x

4
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:23,460
variable. That's my input. Negative 2 times negative 2 is positive 4 and these

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,058
numbers sum to 11. For this last input, I have 4x squared, so I know my answer

6
00:00:29,058 --> 00:00:34,997
is going to contain a variable. I substitute 4x squared as my input and negative

7
00:00:34,997 --> 00:00:40,516
2 times 4 is negative 8. So I have negative 8x squared for my first term. And

8
00:00:40,516 --> 00:00:45,737
then positive 7 added to the end. Great job if you got all of those right.
