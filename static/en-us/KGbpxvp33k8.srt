1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,660
All right, so the next thing we said we
would do is consider adding a scalar.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,190
So again, I wrote the Bellman Equation
for sum reward function R.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:12,210
So this is the target behavior if
we use R as our reward function.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,070
And now we're going to replace R
with a new reward function, R prime,

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,160
which is the old reward
function plus this constant C.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,310
So now on every step,

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,240
we get an additional C reward that we
wouldn't have in the original thing.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,500
So what does that do to our Q function?

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,689
What's our new Q function as a function
of the old Q function and this value C?

10
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,641
>> It'll be different from Q(s,a).

11
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:35,430
Are you going to tell me the answer?

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,260
>> I will, but
only after we do this as a quiz.

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,650
>> Okay.
Fair enough.

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,412
All right so,

15
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:46,140
it's just like what we did before
except now we're adding a constant.

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,410
So I suspect we ought to be
able to use similar reasoning

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,730
to get to the right answer.
