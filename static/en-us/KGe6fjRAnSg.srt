1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:01,760
All right.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,752
One more thing.

3
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:05,258
In order for all of this to work, we need a pr-,.

4
00:00:05,258 --> 00:00:08,530
a, a property called shift invariance.

5
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,130
And shift invariance is basically that your operator behaves

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,800
everywhere the same way.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,200
So I have a couple of pixels over here on the left and I apply my operator.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,720
If I had the same pixels over here on the right.

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,640
Oh, this is my left,

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,990
my right, your right, turn around, okay, or, look, never mind.

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,490
If I have them up and down, right.

12
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,990
If I have a couple pixels up here, and I apply a filter I get the same values if

13
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,250
I have a couple pixels down here and I apply a filter.

14
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,170
That means that I can shift things around and

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,440
do the addition, and get my entire image back.

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,332
As we said, because convolution or correlation are built on multiplication and

17
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:44,572
addition, these are linear operators,

18
00:00:44,572 --> 00:00:48,630
making the whole notion of filtering a linear operation.

19
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,350
And this means that convolution has some very useful properties.

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,790
For example, it's commutative.

21
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,490
All right. So, f convolved with g is the same as g convolved with f.

22
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,080
Remember that whole idea about which is the impulse and which is the filter?

23
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,540
It's also associative.

24
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,570
So that here we, we wrote the associative property of convolution.

25
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,710
We're going to take advantage of that in just a minute.

26
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,300
It has an, a, a unit impulse.

27
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,020
It's the identity.

28
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,030
So that's what we talk about,

29
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,790
that if you convolve any function with the identity you get back that function.

30
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,850
And then here's a cool one.

31
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,392
Differentiation of course is just the limit of subtraction and then a division,

32
00:01:24,392 --> 00:01:28,759
and a division is same as multiplication it's 1 over in that, in that case.

33
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:31,730
So differentiation is a linear operator.

34
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:36,300
Now you may have remembered that from calculus, right, so the derivative of

35
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,640
a times f, where a is a constant, was just a times the derivative of f.

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,145
And the derivative of f plus g was the derivative of f plus the derivative of g.

37
00:01:45,145 --> 00:01:49,644
So, differentiation is also a linear operator.

38
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:54,820
And because of associativity we get this cool property here.

39
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,210
That the derivative of a convolution is the same as taking

40
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,168
the derivative of one of the elements and then convolving it with the second.

41
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:06,440
And we're going to make use of that when we do edge detection and

42
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,169
gradient finding in a little bit.
