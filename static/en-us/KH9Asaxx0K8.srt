1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,710
Consider this situation.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:06,667
This green line represents the actual
price for a stock over time.

3
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:10,475
On this day, it had a two for
one split and accordingly,

4
00:00:10,475 --> 00:00:13,479
it went from $100 to $50 on that day.

5
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:16,532
So in light of this split
on this particular day,

6
00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:21,521
I'd like you to consider these actual
closing prices, and then calculate what

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:25,780
the corresponding adjusted closing
prices would be on these days.
