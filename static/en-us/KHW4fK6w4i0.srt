1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,220
Consider these two games.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,880
Both boulders are falling
from the top of the screen.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,100
But on the left they're not
moving very realistically.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,470
They just move at a constant
velocity down from the top.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,600
On the right however the boulders start
out moving slow and they get faster and

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,420
faster as they move to the bottom,
just like a real falling object would.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,790
Well, it's up to you to take
the game on the left and

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,580
turn it into the game on the right.

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,520
Check out the to-dos
in the course code and

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,790
see if you can make some
realistic falling objects.
