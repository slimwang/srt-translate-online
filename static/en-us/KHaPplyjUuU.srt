1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,770
So this is how the Admin dashboard looks
after you first get your tracking ID.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,080
We're going to close this window,
just have some information,

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,690
you can read it if you want,
I'm going to close it.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,376
So we're currently in the Admin tab and
if you click this button here.

5
00:00:14,376 --> 00:00:19,310
This arrow, left-pointing arrow, that
expands the Admin dashboard for you.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,410
And you see up here these tabs tell
you which dashboard you're in.

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,800
Currently we're in the Admin dashboard.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,720
So the overall account is Whats for
dinner, and

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,330
within that account,
we can have multiple properties.

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,060
But right now we only have one property,
DinnerApp.

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,650
So basically, DinnerApp is our app.

12
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,700
So if you click Property Settings,

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,980
this pretty much takes you to
the settings for the property.

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,680
This is where you come if you
want to find your tracking code.

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,350
Here you see your Tracking ID.

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,050
You can also go to
tracking code down here.

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,660
This is where you started out, remember.

18
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,840
So Google Analytics was
originally designed for websites.

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,980
Before there ever were any Android apps.

20
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,580
It's still a great tool for
tracking website data, but

21
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,620
it's become an equally amazing tool for
tracking mobile app data too.

22
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,180
But there are still parts of
the Analytics dashboard that haven't yet

23
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,376
let go of their origins as a tool for
websites.

24
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:14,700
The icon here, .js, is taken
from the web usage of Analytics.

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,650
Websites use JavaScript code
to talk to Analytics, but for

26
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,330
mobile apps, of course,
JavaScript code is not needed.

27
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,370
Don't worry, it's just an icon.

28
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,580
So to get back to
the overall Admin dashboard,

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,470
you press this button here,
the arrow I mean.

30
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,050
Let's take a look at the views section.

31
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,170
By default, you get a view
called All Mobile App Data,

32
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,720
which, you guessed it, tracks all
the data from your mobile app.

33
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,650
You can add more views if you like,
and set up filters.

34
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,470
But one view will serve us just fine for
now.

35
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,800
When you have some data to view
you can use the Reporting tab

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,360
here to explore the ways that
Users are using your app.

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,790
No Users yet, but

38
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,180
that's not a surprise because we haven't
hooked the app up to Analytics yet.

39
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,930
To get back to the admin dashboard,
go to the Admin tab.
