1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,530
At this point, we need to have
finished installing X-Code.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,740
So if you haven't yet,
pause this video, and

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,450
take a moment to finish
the installation.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,410
Since I already have X-Code installed,

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,850
I'm ready to launch
the Maze application.

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,120
To launch the app, we need to first
launch X-Code, and you can do this by

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,980
clicking on the spotlight icon in
the top right hand corner of the screen.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,240
Or optionally you can hit command and
then space and

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,410
that'll bring up the same spotlight
search and then type, xcode.

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,980
This will bring up
the Xcode launch screen.

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,640
From the launch screen you can
create new Xcode projects,

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,110
open existing projects or
create a playground.

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,580
We won't quite be using playgrounds yet.

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,310
But they're a great tool for
experimenting and writing swift code.

15
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,300
For now you'll want to open
an existing Xcode project,

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,800
the Maze project to be precise.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,880
We've created the Maze project
ahead of time for you, so

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,130
if you haven't downloaded
it already go ahead and

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,390
download it first before
continuing ahead.

20
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,620
Once you've downloaded the project and
saved it somewhere on your computer,

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,970
select Open another project and then
you want to navigate to the project.

22
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,800
So I've saved it on my desktop and you
want to open up the xcode project file.

23
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,310
And we'll give it a second to load,
and here we go.

24
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,370
This is Xcode.

25
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,950
It's a huge application, so we'll
start taking it one piece at a time.

26
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,950
To run the Maze application,

27
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,180
click on the play button in the upper
left hand corner of the Xcode interface.

28
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,190
You may also hear this button
referred to as the Run button.

29
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,250
This will launch the iOS
simulator with the Maze app.

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,300
And there we go.

31
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,420
Congratulations!

32
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,710
You've launched your first app.
