Let us now turn to the third problem solving method under this topic called

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,710
problem reduction. The method of problem reduction actually is quite intuitive.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,910
I'm sure you use it all the time. Given the hard complex problem, reduce it.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,330
Decompose it into multiple easier, smaller, simpler problems. Consider, for

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,970
example, computer programming or software design that I'm sure many of you do

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,860
all the time. Given a hard part of the address, you decompose it

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,216
with a series of smaller problems. How do I read the input? How do I process it?

8
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:38,470
How do I write the output? That itself is a decomposition. In fact,

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,920
one of the fundamental roles that knowledge plays is it tells you how to

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,230
decompose a hard problem into simpler problems.

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,012
Then once you have solutions to this simpler smaller problems.

12
00:00:50,012 --> 00:00:54,190
You can think about how to compose the sub-solutions to the sub-problems into

13
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,490
a solution of the problem as a whole. That's how problem reduction works.
