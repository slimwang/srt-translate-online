1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm going to call my procedure sublists.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We saw before when I drew it out that we wanted 2 arguments:

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the big list of people that I'm going to invite to my party

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and the people that I've selected so far.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
As we make recursive calls to sublists,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the big list of people I've yet to invite will shrink,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and then selected so far--the people who have showed up to my party--

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
may or may not grow. They may show up or not.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So this is a recursive procedure, and every recursive procedure needs a base case

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
or a stopping condition.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If there's no one left to invite, then I'll just print out the people we've selected so far.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Remember when I drew the tree at the bottom there were 8 answers?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
When I get down to the end, I want to print out each of those 8 answers.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If the big list is not empty, then it has at least 1 element--

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the current element, I'll call it--and then here I've just put the rest of the list,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
which is everything after the current element.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
May be empty; may have more things.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In this recursive procedure, we're going to call ourselves 2 times.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There's 1 case where the current person responds to our dinner invitation

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and ends up being one of the people we select,

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and there's another case where they do not. And that's actually it.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Here's a test program.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
My dinner guests are Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony,

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and I'm going to call sublists, and the big list of people is dinner guests,

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and the people I've chosen so far is nothing.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's see if this works.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And in fact, we got just the answer we wanted.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
There's 1 world where everyone shows up,

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
1 world where no one shows up, 3 worlds with just 1 person,

30
00:01:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and 3 worlds with 2 people each, for a total of 8.
