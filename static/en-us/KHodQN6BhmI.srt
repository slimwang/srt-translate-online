00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,820
If you've concluded that all this red
overdraw is the result of wastefully

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,720
drawing hidden portions of the cards
that lie underneath the top card,

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,660
then you'd be correct.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,410
As it currently stands in this code,
the cards are drawn in their entirety

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,470
through this loop and
slightly offset from each other, and

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,100
thus there is natural
portions of overlap.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,910
Now unfortunately, as the cards
are drawn from the bottom up here,

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,900
each successive card ends up covering
the existing cards below it.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,370
This needlessly wastes GPU cycles.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,320
So let's go and fix it.
