1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,650
Just another way of looking at the same concept.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,170
Here this is the film thing.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,210
Light comes in from down here.

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,680
There is protective coating.

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,170
The emulsion is where most of the details of the the light silver halides and

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,070
everything else is.

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,990
The adhesive, and there's the base, and

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,930
of course that's covered up to prevent it from getting damaged across the board.

9
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,060
Sounds simple, and basically, it's a very interesting process.

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,703
You know, full credit to the people who innovated this whole idea ways

11
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:28,329
back when.

12
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:32,418
And some of the earliest cameras, as we talked about before,

13
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:35,102
were developed in the mid 1800's.

14
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:36,722
Purely a chemical process, and

15
00:00:36,722 --> 00:00:40,562
of course, it took them a while to even figure out how to preserve and save and

16
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:44,300
then print out, develop and print out, from these chemical processes.
