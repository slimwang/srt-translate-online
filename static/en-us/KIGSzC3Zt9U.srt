1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,232
The second possibility, the second strategy was Distributed Responsibility.

2
00:00:04,232 --> 00:00:07,740
The ScrollBar receives the change requests and determines the new value, that,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,870
that is the relative, relative position in the ScrollBar tray.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,950
It also knows that the ViewPort depends on this information, so

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,292
it makes a method call passing the relative position to the ViewPort.

6
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:20,860
The ViewPort compares the relative position received to the current value

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,920
associated with the top displayed line, and realizes that it cannot

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,890
satisfy the responsibility. It formulates a request to the FileManager for

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,080
the additional lines. The FileManager component returns the lines to

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,870
the ViewPort for display, thereby reestablishing the invariant. That is,

11
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,920
Knowledge of the invariant is distributed among three components that

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,740
delegate partial responsibility to each other when needed.
