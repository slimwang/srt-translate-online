1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,546
Now, you can imagine that if I have a linear factor that has a negative

2
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:07,390
coefficient in front of the X that I can actually pull that negative out and

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,482
instead write the factor in an equivalent from with a positive coefficient for

4
00:00:11,482 --> 00:00:15,562
X. The negative can be reflected in the other factor that we're multiplying by.

5
00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:19,472
This basically means that I can choose which coefficients go in front of our X

6
00:00:19,472 --> 00:00:23,618
term. And if I want, I can decide that I want those to be positive. That's

7
00:00:23,618 --> 00:00:27,876
definitely what I would prefer, just for ease of looking at our factorization.

8
00:00:27,876 --> 00:00:31,914
So let's just go ahead and remove the negative number pairs that multiply to

9
00:00:31,914 --> 00:00:35,759
equal 6. This makes our lives much easier. Now we only have two pairs of

10
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,904
coefficients to check to put in these slots instead of four. So let's do just

11
00:00:39,904 --> 00:00:44,417
that. Let's check them. I've written out for you two possible ways of factoring

12
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:48,710
our original expression of 6x squared minus 7x minus 5. Actually only one of

13
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,802
these 2 ways is possible because you know that only one of these combinations of

14
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:56,801
coefficients for x actually works. So for the one that works you're going to

15
00:00:56,801 --> 00:01:00,833
figure that out by figuring out which number belongs here and here or here and

16
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:04,864
here depending on which one is right and then on the equation that's not going

17
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:08,721
to work at all based on these first 2 coefficients. You're going to simply

18
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:12,984
bubble in wrong for the 2 constant term slots. So basically, try out each of the

19
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:17,010
4 numbers that are written down here, which you notice are the 4 different

20
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,212
factors of negative 5 that you found earlier. And once you find out which one

21
00:01:21,212 --> 00:01:25,525
works, fill in the proper numbers and then rule out the other entire equation.
