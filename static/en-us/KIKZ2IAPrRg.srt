1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,323
Starting with x equals to 3y minus 1, we can add 1 to both sides. And then,

2
00:00:05,323 --> 00:00:09,763
divide both sides by 3 to end up with 1 3rd, the quantity x plus 1 is equal to

3
00:00:09,763 --> 00:00:16,030
y. Then, of course, we can just switch what's on either side of the equation.

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,511
That way, y is on the right side of the equation, and we have y equal 1 3rd

5
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:21,553
times x plus 1.
