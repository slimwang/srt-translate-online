00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,480
Well, you might think, and

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,410
I'll go back to here, that it's because they're horizontal that we

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,080
know that they're parallel image planes.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,230
But, actually, parallel image planes mean that the line,

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,730
the epipolar lines are all going to be parallel.

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,910
The only reason they're horizontal is because I happen to be holding the camera

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,540
in such a way, the, the pair of cameras, that the baseline between them

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,730
is horizontal with respect to the vertical in the image.

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,430
Right?

10
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,330
So basically if I had held things this way or rotated my one camera that way

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:34,920
ins, I would still have parallel epipolar lines because the epipolar

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,220
lines are defined by the geometry of the camera center and the point.

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,080
That is the plane, they just have to be in a plane.

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,030
But I can shift them up and down, I can rotate them.

15
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,370
And that will rotate or my parallel lines so it's not the horizontal epipolar

16
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,590
lines that tell you that the coplanar, but the fact that they're parallel.
