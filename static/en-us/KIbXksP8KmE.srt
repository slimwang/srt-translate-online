1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,940
So when we do this, we have, with the ViewPort,

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:08,300
we have its height as a percept and we have its contents a, as a percept. For

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,660
the scroll bar, we have the position of the handle is a percept and

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:19,100
also the size is a percept. But we don't currently have any percepts for

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,580
the FileManager, and in fact the user doesn't directly see the file manager.

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,790
However if we took our 40,000 foot view of the system, and, and

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,229
we said what is external to the system and

8
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:37,080
what is internal to the system. The user is external to the system. Users, is,

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,410
is the one that's going to be taken advantage of the, of the system. But

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,860
also, the file system itself, the operating system is external to the system and

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,340
the operating system is the one with which the FileManager component has to

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:57,587
deal. So we're going to treat the operating system as an external acto,r and

13
00:00:57,587 --> 00:01:03,500
the FileManager is going to interact with that external actor.

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,740
And as far as the FileManager is concerned, it has an attribute which is

15
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:13,744
the document. Providing that as a, as a resource to the rest of the system, and

16
00:01:13,744 --> 00:01:19,420
it's, it's, it's It also has an interface to this external actor,

17
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,340
that is, the actor has to provide that, that document. So we have an attribute

18
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,930
there which is, the document which is a sequence of, a sequence of lines.
