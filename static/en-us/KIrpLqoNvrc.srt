00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,560
If you open up the GIF preview of your
controller in the Objective C Project,

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,210
you'll see the method sharegif.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,890
If you built the app meme,

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,260
this code may look very similar to
the code you used to share a meme.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,010
Notice that the GIF is being
sent as an NSData object.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,580
And that the NSData object is
being initialized from the GIF

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,322
objects url property.

8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:27,220
The ActivityViewController is being
initialized with an array of activity

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,740
items which includes just one item,
the animated GIF.

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,500
The completion handler is being set so

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,810
that if the activity is completed we
return to the RootViewController,

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,960
which right now is
the welcome view controller.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,570
The ActivityViewController
is presented modally.

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,980
Recreate this functionality in Swift and

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,980
then move on to compare your
implementation to the sample code.
