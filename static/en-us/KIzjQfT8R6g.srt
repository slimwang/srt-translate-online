00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,480
You can add color to
your websites using CSS.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,070
However, in order to do this, you first
need to understand how color is encoded.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,446
To start, color is composed of light.

4
00:00:10,446 --> 00:00:15,020
All light, including the light being
emitted from your screen right now,

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,760
is composed of a certain proportion
of red, green, and blue light.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,050
The amount of red, green, and blue light
is what determines the color you see.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,173
For example, the combination of red and

8
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:30,056
green light with the absence of blue
light is what makes the color yellow.

9
00:00:30,056 --> 00:00:31,521
The combination of green and

10
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:35,072
blue light with the absence of red
light is what makes the color cyan.

11
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,730
And there are countless
variations in between.

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,270
The different combinations of red,
green, and

13
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,120
blue light make up 16,777,216 colors.

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,550
That's a lot of colors.

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,590
When writing CSS, you express color by
specifying the amount of red, green,

16
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,520
and blue light that should be present.

17
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,640
This can be done in one of two ways.

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,450
In the first way, which is commonly
referred to as RGB, each amount of red,

19
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:06,290
green, and blue light is written as
a decimal number between 0 and 255.

20
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,011
0 being the lowest value or
no presence of light and

21
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:14,866
255 being the highest value or
100% presence of the light.

22
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:20,127
For example, if I wanted to change
the background color of this page

23
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:26,608
to magenta, then I'd write
background-color: rgb (255, 0, 255).

24
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:29,431
The first 255 specifies red light.

25
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:31,809
The 0 specifies green light.

26
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:35,090
And the second 255 specifies blue light.

27
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,977
The combination of these
values produces magenta.

28
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:42,660
In the second way,
which is called hexadecimal or hex for

29
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,268
short, each amount of red, green, and

30
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:50,279
blue light is written as a hexadecimal
number between the values 00 and FF.

31
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:56,030
00, which is just 0 in decimal, and
FF, which is just 255 in decimal.

32
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,024
If you're unfamiliar with how
hexadecimal works, check below for

33
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:02,097
some helpful links.

34
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:07,956
Using the same example for magenta,
I would instead write background-color,

35
00:02:07,956 --> 00:02:13,656
a pound sign, this tells the browser
I'm using hex code, and then ff00ff.

36
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:19,499
The first ff, which is really just
255 in decimal, specifies red light.

37
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:24,294
00, which is just 0 in decimal,
specifies green light.

38
00:02:24,294 --> 00:02:29,780
And the second ff, which again is 255
in decimal specifies the blue light.

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,160
This encoding also produces
the color magenta.

40
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,790
Now colors aren't always as
straightforward as primary and

41
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,320
secondary colors.

42
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,120
Like I said,

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,160
there are millions of different
colors you can express using CSS.

44
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,220
Often what can be helpful is using
a color picker to get the exact shade,

45
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,870
tint, and tone for
the color you're trying to use.

46
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,380
You've probably seen a color picker
before if you've ever used a graphics or

47
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,610
design tool.

48
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,434
But did you know that most browsers
actually come with their own built-in

49
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:00,610
color picker?

50
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,710
Check it out.

51
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,890
Here i have Google Chrome open,
and I'm looking at BBC's website.

52
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,380
If I inspect the navigation bar and
try changing the background color,

53
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,460
you can see that by clicking
on the color square,

54
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,080
I open Google Chrome's color picker.

55
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,320
With the color picker,

56
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,730
I can use the eyedropper to select
another color on the screen.

57
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,130
I can change the hue by
dragging the slider.

58
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,762
I can select a color, and
I can toggle between the hex and

59
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:29,290
RGB encodings of the color.
