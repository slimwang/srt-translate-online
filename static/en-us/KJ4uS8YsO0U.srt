1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We'll talk about that a little more later,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
before I go on, I want to mention one very important principle in cryptography,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which is known as Kerckhoff's Principle,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and it goes back to a book that Kerckhoff wrote back in 1883,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and the way Kerckhoff stated it was this--this was in a book he wrote in 1883

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
about military cryptography [speaking French],

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and I apologize for my French, but this loosely translates as,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
"The cipher must not depend on secrecy of the mechanism.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It must not matter if it falls in the hands of the enemy."

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So, the reason for that--and it's important--

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
what he's focusing on is the mechanism here.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So, if you think about these two functions we need--

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
we need encryption and decryption.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Coming up with new functions--or new mechanisms--

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
in Kerckhoff's day these were mostly mechanical devices

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that you needed as part of the encryption process--

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
well, that's a lot of work.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You don't want to have to keep inventing new encryption and decryption functions,

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and deciding they're secure and distributing them.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What you want is some way that,

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
even if your encryption and decryption functions are known,

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
your cipher can still be secure,

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and the way to achieve that is to use a key.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So instead of just having the message as input to the encryption function,

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
the other input to the encryption is a key,

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and if it's a symmetric cryptosystem, that same key

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
is the key that is needed in the decryption function as well.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If the security relies only on keeping the key secret,

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
well, then, we can make our encryption and decryption functions public,

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
we can analyze them, we can put a lot of work

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
into developing good encryption and decryption functions,

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and then the security depends only on keeping the key secret.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
If we think our key has been exposed,

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
well, then we just need to come up with a new key,

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
but we can keep using the same functions.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If the function turns out to have a weakness in it,

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
well, that's a much more serious problem.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Then we need to develop a new encryption function

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and argue that that function is secure.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So, this quiz is to check that you understand

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Kerckhoff's Principle and understand the terms that we've defined.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So the question is: which parts of a cryptosystem must be kept secret?

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The choices are: Alice, the algorithm used for encryption,

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
the algorithm used for decryption, the keys, and the ciphertext.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all the parts that must be kept secret.
