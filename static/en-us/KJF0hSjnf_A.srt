1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,835
All right, what's next?

2
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,310
I'm sure you were thinking we now
add it to the default task, and

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,460
then to the JavaScript watcher.

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,390
And you're half right,
that's what we would ideally do.

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,730
But in an ideal world,
we'd have hoverboards and

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,300
unlimited performance on our computers.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,810
Turns out that running complex unit
tests, especially in a headless browser,

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,370
can get really, really slow.

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,500
So adding into our watch process
would kill our life editing workflow.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,780
In order to solve this problem,

11
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,630
smart people invented continuous
integration in the Cloud.
