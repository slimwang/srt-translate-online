00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,180
Congratulations on making it to lesson six. This

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,230
is the final lesson for the course, and we

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,170
brought in Facebook data scientist Saung Masin to share

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,890
with you some of his own work in EDA.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,350
>> In this lesson, I'll walk you through an analysis of

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,780
diamonds. You'll learn about the rich history behind the diamond market, and

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,420
use the EDA techniques that you've

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,892
learned to develop a quantitative understanding

9
00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:25,820
of it. The ultimate goal is to build a predictive model of

10
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,200
diamonds that's going to help you figure out whether a

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,730
given diamond is a good deal, or a rip-off.

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,020
>> If you're in the market for a diamond, exploring this

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,430
data set can help you understand what goes into the price

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,470
of a diamond, and even if you're not looking to buy,

15
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,790
the socioeconomic and political history of the diamond industry is fascinating.

16
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,020
>> Diamonds gave rise to the mining industry in

17
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,870
South Africa, which is now the most advanced economy in

18
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,390
the region. Diamonds also drove the British and

19
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,320
the Dutch to colonize southern Africa in the first

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,520
place, and have driven conflicts ranging from the Boer

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,180
wars to modern day civil strife across the region.

22
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,000
>> Now, you should have some experience

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,700
working with the diamonds data based on

24
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,640
the problem sets in this course. I'll

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,520
let Solomon guide you through his exploration.
