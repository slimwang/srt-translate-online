00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,050
Up to this point we've covered four different conic sections. We looked at

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:10,660
circles then ellipses, hyperbola and finally parabola. We call each of these a

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,830
conic section because they come from the intersection of a plane with a cone.

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,736
So, here we have a cone and we have a plane that intersects it, creating this

5
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:25,240
shape. Here's another cone that has a plane cutting straight across through it.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,811
And notice that this plane is horizontal to the base of the cone. For this

7
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:33,774
shape, we have a plane cutting at an angle down to the side of the cone. And,

8
00:00:33,774 --> 00:00:38,932
finally, for this shape, We have a plane cutting through a double cone. So what

9
00:00:38,932 --> 00:00:42,523
I want you to do is match each of these conic sections with the picture that is

10
00:00:42,523 --> 00:00:48,232
represented by it. So if you think this shape is a circle, you would write a in

11
00:00:48,232 --> 00:00:50,930
this box. Good luck here.
