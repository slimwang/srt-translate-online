1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well, let's think it through together, and then write out the details.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
At a high level, this is going to be:

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
an element , an element, and then Empty.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So we're going to end up making a list

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that has element 1 in it and element 2 in it,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and then nothing else--

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
based on this rule up here, where we just make a bigger and bigger list,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
out of the list containing the first element

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and everything else we've gathered up.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So this will be the final value of our parse tree,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
corresponding to this more graphical parse tree--

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
really more of a list, but a lot of things in computer science are.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Rama's Journey is more commonly known as the Ramayana.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's a Sanskrit epic that's a very important part of the Hindu canon

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and it explores human values and Dharma.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If you haven't already had a chance to read it,

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I strongly encourage you to make a rendezvous with Rama.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It's time well spent.
