00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,973
But there's another way I might have implemented this getFriends method. I

2
00:00:03,973 --> 00:00:07,336
could just add a toString method to the Person class. If the toString method

3
00:00:07,336 --> 00:00:12,062
returns the name, then I could implement getFriends the way I did before. So

4
00:00:12,062 --> 00:00:15,224
here's approximately what I had before, and if I run the tester again, I can

5
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:19,612
see that the getFriends method is working. This is because when I called

6
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:23,498
toString on the arraylist of Friends, it uses each friend's toString method, to

7
00:00:23,498 --> 00:00:28,213
get it's name. Well, actually just to get a representation of it, which in this

8
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:32,952
case, is the name. This implementation will work, so long as I don't want the

9
00:00:32,952 --> 00:00:38,245
person to return something more than the name, in its toString method.
