1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And the correct answer is after 10--the sum of all these things over here

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
up to the 10th are 0.012 approximately.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There's a slight truncation issue here that gets some work with number and is far away from 5%,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which will be 0.05, but if you're now were to add this guy over here, you'll go beyond 0.05.
