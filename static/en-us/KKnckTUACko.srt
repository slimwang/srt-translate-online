Great factoring skills if you got this correct. We can factor a 3x from the

2
00:00:04,654 --> 00:00:09,596
first two terms. We'll have 3x times the quantity 4x minus 3. I've been saying

3
00:00:09,596 --> 00:00:14,486
this word quantity a lot and I use it when I really talk about the parentheses.

4
00:00:14,486 --> 00:00:18,946
I have 3x times some quantity 4x minus 3. If we distribute the 3x to 4x and

5
00:00:18,946 --> 00:00:23,476
minus 3, we wind up with what we started with. So this is correct factoring.

6
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:27,992
Next, I can see that negative 8x and 6 share a factor of 2. This would leave me

7
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:32,671
with negative 4x plus 3 in the second parentheses. You might have gotten stuck

8
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:37,341
here and that's okay. We notice that this first parentheses and the second

9
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:42,398
parentheses aren't the same. The 4x is positive and this is negative. The 3 is

10
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:47,271
negative, but this 3 is positive. Well, instead of taking out a positive 2,

11
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:52,017
let's take out a negative 2. If we factor out a negative 2 from negative 8x,

12
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:56,767
we're left with positive 4x. And if we factor a negative 2 from positive 6,

13
00:00:56,767 --> 00:01:02,066
we're left with negative 3. Finally, we factor out the 4x minus 3 from the first

14
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:07,380
term and the second term. This leaves us with 3x minus 2 times 4x minus 3. You

15
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,206
could have either have written your answer like this or like this. Both are

16
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:12,875
correct.
