1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,260
Now you might be thinking,
why are we writing the code to display

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,820
a GIF if we haven't converted
the video to a GIF yet?

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,760
The answer is,

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,300
it's easier to test the GIF conversion
code if we can see the GIF.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,860
A UI image view off the shelf doesn't
have the ability to display a GIF.

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,140
Let's see how the gif was displayed
in the Objective-C project.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,200
If we go into the WelcomeViewController
and look in the viewWillAppear method,

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,920
we can see where this variable
firstLaunchGif is being initialized.

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,531
If we Cmd+click on this
initWithName method,

10
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:35,220
it'll take us inside the gif class.

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,714
Here we can see that the image is
being set with a call to this method

12
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:42,514
animatedImageWithAnimatedGifName.

13
00:00:42,514 --> 00:00:45,230
Okay, where's this method?

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:50,860
Let's see, if we scroll up we can see
tat animatedImageWithAnimatedGifName

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,440
is a part of this extension
that Rob Mayoff wrote,

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,980
that UIImage+animatedGIF extension.

17
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,810
This seems like it's getting
a little complicated.

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,447
But guess what?

19
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:06,190
Arne Bahlo has an extension that
does exactly what we need and

20
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,005
it's written in Swift.

21
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,420
So let's switch back to our
Swift project and go ahead and

22
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,200
add a new file called UIImage+gif.

23
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:17,980
You can find a link to
the GitHub repo containing

24
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,845
Bahlo's SwiftGif extension
in the corresponding text.

25
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:27,110
If we go into his repository and
we go into the SwiftGif common folder,

26
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,310
we can see this UIImage+Gif.swift file.

27
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,300
Go ahead and copy this code and put
it into the Swift file you just made.

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,540
Make sure that you copy this
copyright information as well, so

29
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,010
that Bahlo gets proper credit.

30
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,540
Next we want to hook up
the storyboard outlet for

31
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,640
our WelcomeViewController's
gifImageView.

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,340
So let's open up the storyboard and
we'll open up the assistant editor.

33
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,905
And we'll hook up the GIFImageView.

34
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,450
Next we want to set the GIFImageView
here in viewWillAppear.

35
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,630
If we go back to GitHub can see
here in our Arne Bahlo's readme for

36
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,460
the UI image extension
how to use the extension.

37
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,990
I'm going to call this
proofOfConceptGif for now.

38
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,630
And then we'll call UIImage, and

39
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,580
then the method gifWithName, and
then you'll notice that I've

40
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,115
included a couple GIFs to get
you guys started in the project.

41
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:30,860
hotlineBling is the name of one of them,
and then we need to set

42
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:36,670
the image on our gifImageView
to be the proofOfConceptGif.

43
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,150
And of course we don't want
to forget to call super.

44
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,990
So we'll make sure to
call superViewWillAppear.

45
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,570
And now we should be ready to run it.

46
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,530
And when we run it,
sweet, there's Drake.

47
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,710
Now when we convert our video into
a GIF, we'll be able to display it.
