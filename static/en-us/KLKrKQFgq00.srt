Hi. My name's Mike Wales and

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,500
I'm the Web Development Curriculum Manager here at Udacity.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,910
I usually create a new branch whenever I'm moving on to

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,790
a different piece of work.

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,500
Anytime I'm doing something different, I will create a new branch.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,350
I like to think of it as context switching.

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,900
Whenever I'm switching to work on a new feature or

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,710
whether I'm going to correct a bug, I'll create a new branch at that time.

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,140
Git branches help you keep a project organized, particularly,

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,240
when you're sharing that project publicly.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,580
You'll have your master branch, and

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:33,230
that would be your production quality branch that never breaks, always works.

13
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,030
And then you could have a development branch where active work is

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,050
taking place on your project.

15
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,340
Then a lot of times you'll have things like an experimental branch or

16
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,490
maybe some unique feature branches.

17
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,100
Those are things that you're working on, and

18
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,620
you fully expect them to break, and you want to share those with the public, but

19
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,710
with the understanding that this isn't production quality work just yet.

20
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,430
Branches are also good when not only collaborating publicly, but

21
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,670
their really good to collaborate with yourself.

22
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,019
So a lot of times, if I'm working on a feature, and then I come across a bug.

23
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,920
Branches allow me that ability to context switch and

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,880
get away from the work I'm doing on my feature.

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,880
Go back to where I need to be to fix the bug and

26
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,540
then compartmentalize that work.

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,850
Branches are really good.

28
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,630
Even if I get bored on working on a feature.

29
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,260
It gives you the ability to, okay, I want to switch and

30
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,740
start working on something else right now.
