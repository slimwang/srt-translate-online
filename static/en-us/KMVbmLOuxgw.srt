1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,879
I don't know about you but I can see
five things that are wrong here.

2
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,839
Number one the text fields in the header
don't stretch all the way horizontally.

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:17,250
And if you can't see them just go
to Canvas, then Layout Rectangles.

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,500
So this way you can see
the text fields and

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,550
they don't take all
the space like they should.

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,670
Number two, there's no space
between the stack views and

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,030
we should turn this back on.

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,289
And see,
no space between the stack views.

9
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:36,329
The text field doesn't take
enough vertical space.

10
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,030
The buttons here are distributed
in a kind of funky way and

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,270
they take up way too
much vertical space.

12
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,790
This vertical space should
belong to the text field.

13
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,560
So I suggest you pause the video now and

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,270
think of what you would do
to fix these five issues.

15
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,449
Okay, let's continue so

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,650
let's fix number one,
the header is a vertical stack view.

17
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:07,689
So we just need to change
the alignment property to Fill,

18
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,188
and now it takes all
the available space.

19
00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:17,280
If you want to see the text fields
just go back here, see there they are.

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,780
The second one,

21
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,140
the lack of space between the stack
views it's also easy to fix.

22
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:26,629
Select the root Stack View,
and by the way when you have

23
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:30,140
many stack views it's a good
idea to give names to them.

24
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,314
So, let's do it right way,
this is going to be the Root one,

25
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:37,239
then we have the Header,

26
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:43,439
inside the Header we have First Name and
Last Name, and we have the Footer.

27
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,808
Okay so lets select the Root Stack View
and add some spacing.

28
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:54,870
I like 8, that's the standard value by
the way, the one recommended by Apple.

29
00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:02,420
Now the distribution of the footer is
Fill, this algorithm has two features.

30
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,840
Number one, it doesn't care about
the intrinsic content size of the views,

31
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,210
that's why it changed them all.

32
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,870
And number two it favors the first view,

33
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,780
that's why the first button is
much bigger than the other ones.

34
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,080
We can fix this by changing the
distribution and we have a few options.

35
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,100
Actually we have three, Fill Equally,

36
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,895
Equal Spacing, or Equal Centering.

37
00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:38,269
I prefer, Fill Equally and
then put some spacing, let's give it 20.

38
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:41,939
The last two issues
are actually the same thing.

39
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:45,680
Text view and footer are fighting for

40
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,490
vertical space and
we want the text view to win this fight.

41
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,530
How can we do that?

42
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:58,520
We can do it by lowering its
Content Hugging, and we're almost there.

43
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,730
There's just one minor problem
that you can see if you remove

44
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:05,959
the rectangles, and it's here.

45
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,580
There is no space between
the caption and the text field, and

46
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,270
also there is no space between these
two rows, these two stack views.

47
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,909
We know how to fix that, so

48
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:20,389
we'll add some spacing to
the First Name Stack View.

49
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:26,199
Again, I'll use 8, that's the standard
and same thing for the Last Name.

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,159
And if we want to add some spacing here

51
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:36,599
we need to select the Header Stack View
which is vertical and add some spacing.

52
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,739
Again, I'll use 8, and

53
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,430
check this out the first one is now
much narrower than the second one.

54
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,700
Why?

55
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:50,199
Because of the distribution algorithm,
it's Fill and

56
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:55,139
Fill always shrinks or
expands the first one.

57
00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:00,919
So, let's use Fill Equally and
it looks much better.

58
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:06,609
So make sure you understand everything
that went wrong and how we fixed it.

59
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,220
By understanding this you will soon
realize there's a logic to auto layout

60
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:13,199
in a bizarre kind of way.

61
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,449
So stick to your commandments and
principles and don't panic.
