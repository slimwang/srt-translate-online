00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,100
Hey Andy, so how'd it go this time?

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,400
>> Pretty terribly.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,890
It probably took about ten times longer to get five cats working than it

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:08,770
did for two.

5
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,250
Which doesn't make a lot of sense.

6
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,220
>> Oh that's rough.

7
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,645
>> Yeah. I had a lot of divs, if that's, is that a good thing?

8
00:00:14,645 --> 00:00:16,820
[LAUGH] A lot of divs with cats and

9
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,500
buttons and, you know, cat one, cat two, cat three.

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,960
And I tried to, in the JavaScript file, iterate over all of those.

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,370
And bind the buttons to the counters for

12
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,830
the different cats, but everything kept, kept getting down to the very last cat.

13
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,830
>> Mm. That was that closure issue we were talking about.

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,859
>> It was.

15
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:36,760
That was where the 10x time increase came from, was figuring that out.

16
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,637
But I mean it's working.

17
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:39,768
So, that's good.

18
00:00:39,768 --> 00:00:44,010
But, I, I, I don't want to keep making things this way.
