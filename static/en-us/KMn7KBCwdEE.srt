00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,645
Let's lay back to what we did before. And what our goal is, eventually, we want

2
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:07,223
to get x bytes off. We want to isolate it on one side of the equation, so that

3
00:00:07,223 --> 00:00:10,940
means that something is going to have to happen with all this constant stuff

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,903
over here. Something is also going to have to happen with our coefficient of a.

5
00:00:14,903 --> 00:00:18,616
So actually, let's do with both of those things now. What does that will leave

6
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:22,156
us with on the left side of the equation and what does that put on the right

7
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:22,503
side?
