00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,002
Let's talk about one of the new terms that we just saw in the last quiz, a

2
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:08,425
relative minimum. Now if we have some function, f of x, we can call a value of

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:13,111
that function, at a certain point, a relative minimum, if it is related to other

4
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:16,916
points on the function how. Does it need to be lower than them or higher than

5
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:21,386
them? And does being a relative minimum refer to the value of the function at

6
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:26,138
that point, in relation to the entire range of the function, or just in relation

7
00:00:26,138 --> 00:00:29,751
to other values of the function near the relative minimum?
