1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,340
So recall that beta is
the slope of the line and

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,848
alpha is where it hits
the y-intercept there.

3
00:00:10,848 --> 00:00:11,913
So, higher alpha.

4
00:00:11,913 --> 00:00:17,110
Well ABC is intersecting
the y-axis there

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:24,390
much further up than XYZ so
ABC's got higher alpha.

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,460
In terms of beta, look,
the slope of ABC is much higher than XYZ

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,770
so ABC also wins on
the higher beta question.
