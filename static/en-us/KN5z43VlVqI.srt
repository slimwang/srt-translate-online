1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,719
Let's have a quick checkpoint
of what we've done so far.

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:04,360
You've done a lot.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,850
So, first of all, you were able
to get the geoFencing Event.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,090
And then you were able to determine
what the transition was from that event,

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,710
whether you were exiting or
leaving the geoFence.

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,960
You then got the list of geoFences
that were triggered during that event.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,080
Remember, more than one can be
triggered if they're overlapping.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,570
You created a string out of this list.

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,520
And then you created a notification
helper that generated

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,790
a notification from that string.

11
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,160
So now, all you have left to do is to
call the method, the send notification

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,695
method that sends the notification for
us, and add that to your onHandleIntent.
