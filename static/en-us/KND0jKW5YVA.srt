00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,536
>> So that means then, that we might have two ways to get an answer of 0 over

2
00:00:04,536 --> 00:00:09,505
here. Either a could be 0 or b could be 0 or in some cases both, if a equals b.

3
00:00:09,505 --> 00:00:13,966
Now that we know that either a or b or both need to equal 0 if we have an

4
00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:19,069
equation of the form a times b equals 0, that means that to make this equation

5
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:23,926
true, we either need to have x minus 4 or x minus 28 equaling 0. So then what

6
00:00:23,926 --> 00:00:28,469
two equations can we get out of this one equation that will each give us a

7
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:33,556
solution to this equation. I know this is kind of a tricky, subtle question, but

8
00:00:33,556 --> 00:00:38,627
think back to what we learned about the ab equals 0 equation to figure this out.

9
00:00:38,627 --> 00:00:42,594
We should end up with two expressions, each set equal to 0.
