00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,343
Now let's look at the next step in converting light to data.

2
00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:09,354
The actual sensor information, with Bayer data, will have something like this.

3
00:00:09,354 --> 00:00:11,708
We saw some of that in the previous slide.

4
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:15,275
The red is chunked up into small reds here, because that's the red rows.

5
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:17,620
The green, of course, also have this Bayer pattern.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,360
This is, again, output of a Bayer filter.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,914
We want to demosaic this to get our real image.

8
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:25,137
Going through the process that I talked about,

9
00:00:25,137 --> 00:00:28,260
with some interpolation, we can construct an image like this.

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,850
Here you see a little bit of an aliasing, because again,

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,830
we have intentionally showcased the kind of artifacts of doing this.

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,900
But simple cleaning and

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,740
interpolation that's done, this image would be made to look perfect.
