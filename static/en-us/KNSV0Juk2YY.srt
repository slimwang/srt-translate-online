1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here is the answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Obviously x1 minus L0 is -9, because L0 minus x1 is a measurement of +9.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's add this in. We add 1 over here on the main diagonal--1 and 1.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We subtract 1 off the main diagonal just like before--a simple pattern.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Then a 9 over here goes back to 0 but to 9 over here.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I hope this makes perfect sense to you.
