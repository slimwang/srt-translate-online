So you can probably guess what this question would be. You

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,580
are going to find a persona created by one of your classmates

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,070
in use case. And you are going to create a feature

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,920
list and a flow for them. And once you've done that,

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,480
you are going to respond to their post in the forum,

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,620
and hopefully engage in the discussion. You can maximize your chances

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,930
of engaging in a discussion if you choose a student who

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,870
has posted recently. If you choose someone who posted six months ago,

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,650
it might be hard. And hopefully the feature list info that you create for

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,540
this student persona in use case will be really perfect for them. But it might

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:41,100
not be. This stuff is not super trivial. And if it's not, that's good. Use

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,790
this as an opportunity to see where you went wrong and how you can improve.
