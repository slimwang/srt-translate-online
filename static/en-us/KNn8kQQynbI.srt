If you got 15 over 28, great job. Now, let's go ahead and do the problem. If I

2
00:00:05,869 --> 00:00:11,701
have 3 4ths, times 5 7ths, we know when we multiply fractions that we have to

3
00:00:11,713 --> 00:00:17,569
multiply the numerators together. And we have to multiply the denominators

4
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:23,351
together. So, 3 times 5 is 15. And, 4 times 7 is 28. Now we would need to check

5
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:29,171
to see if we need to reduce the fraction, but since there's no factors in common

6
00:00:29,183 --> 00:00:31,338
between 15 and 28, we're done.
