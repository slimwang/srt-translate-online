1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's do one more bit of practice

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
converting non-deterministic machines to deterministic ones.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Here I've written a non-deterministic machine.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It has ambiguity.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Right in state 1 there are 2 ways to go on a.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It also has epsilon transitions,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and I'll start making its deterministic equivalent down here.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Well, when we enter the non-deterministic machine,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
we could only be in state 1, but after that we could see an a,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and if I see an a I could be in 2, 4,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
or I could take the free epsilon transition to 5,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
or I could keep going and take the free epsilon transition to 6.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll label my new state 2456

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
because it keeps track of everywhere that I could have my fingers

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
if I'm simulating this non-deterministic machine.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now, should this state be an accepting state or not?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, remember that a finite state machine accepts if there's any path

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
to an accepting state, and 6 is one of our accepting states.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Because the original machine could accept a,

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
a, epsilon, epsilon, win, we want our new machine to also accept a.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
A, win.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
In my converted world, the state accepts if any of its corresponding

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
original states also accept.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's say that I'm in either 2, 4, 5, or 6 and I see a c.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If I'm in 2 and I see a c, I fall off the world.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I'm in 4, fall off the world.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
5, I go to 6, looking good.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
6, fall off the world.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Here if I was in 2, 4, 5, or 6 and I see a c,

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I end up just in state 6, and that's definitely an accepting state.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Now, there's some other ways to get out of 2, 4, 5, and 6,

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and when we do, we might be in states 2 or 3.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Since 3 is an accepting state up there,

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
2 or 3 is an accepting state down here.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If I'm in 2 or 3, on a b from 2 I go to 3,

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and c I'd fall off the world, so we'd end up in state 3.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If I'm in 2 or 3 and I see a c,

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I must really have been in state 3, and I stay in state 3,

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
so either on b or c we end up in just state 3,

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
which is also an accepting state.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And if I'm in state 3, there's a self-loop back to state 3.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Now, I've filled out almost all of this deterministic equivalent.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But I forgot to label an edge.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Help me out.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
As the quiz, what should the label for this edge be

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
so that this deterministic equivalent and this non-deterministic machine

47
00:02:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
accept exactly the same language?
