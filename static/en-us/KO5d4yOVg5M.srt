1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,428
The answer is 3. This is actually pretty hard I think, especially the first time

2
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:08,579
you think about it. Since we know we want to have this quantity on the right

3
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:12,800
hand side, we need to think about what we're actually adding when we entered

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,176
this 1 inside the parenthesis. If we look at the entire expression, including

5
00:00:17,176 --> 00:00:21,330
the coefficient of 3 outside of the parenthesis, we actually need to add a 3

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,367
times 1 in order to get this. So that's going to give us the equation y plus 13

7
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:30,775
equals 3 times the quantity x squared plus 2x plus 1. Awesome.
