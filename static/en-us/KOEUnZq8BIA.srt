1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,358
Now as you know,

2
00:00:01,358 --> 00:00:05,330
we want to use reinforcement
learning algorithms to trade with.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,664
So let's think now about how we can map
the trading problem to reinforcement

4
00:00:09,664 --> 00:00:11,300
learning.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,110
Okay, so consider each of these factors.

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,660
Buy, sell, holding long, Bollinger
value, return from trade, daily return.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,310
And then consider,
is that item a description of our state

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,670
that we ought to consider
before we make a trade?

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,970
Is it an action that we give to
the market to cause a trade to occur?

10
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:41,000
Or is it a potential reward that we
would use to inform our algorithm for

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,640
learning how to trade.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,920
And it's potentially the case that some
of these may serve more than one role.
