00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,650
Now that we've walked through adding two fractions together, let's return to our

2
00:00:03,662 --> 00:00:07,250
original question. You want to frost a cake for a party. You frost a fourth of

3
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:10,825
the cake in vanilla icing, and 2 5th of the cake in strawberry icing. What

4
00:00:10,837 --> 00:00:14,350
fraction of the cake is frosted? So, I want you to try to answer this question

5
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:18,000
using what we've learned. You can use diagrams to help support your answer, or

6
00:00:18,012 --> 00:00:21,700
if you already know the method and understand it really well, you can just apply

7
00:00:21,712 --> 00:00:31,311
that. Is it 3 5th, 3 9th, 1 10th, 3 20th, or 13 20th? Make your choice.
