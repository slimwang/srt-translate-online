1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,432
We can always simplify powers of i since the pattern continues to repeat

2
00:00:03,432 --> 00:00:07,920
itself. To find any power of i we simply divide the power of i by four and look

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,610
at the remainder. The remainder will either be 0, 1, 2, or 3 and will determine

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,613
the power of i. For example i to the 12th, we would take the power of 12 and

5
00:00:18,613 --> 00:00:25,202
divide it by 4. We know 12 divided by 4 equals 3 with a remainder of 0. This

6
00:00:25,202 --> 00:00:29,538
remainder becomes the new power for i. So we know i to the 12th is really

7
00:00:29,538 --> 00:00:35,240
equivalent to i to the 0, and anything to the 0 power equals 1. This should

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,240
also make sense since i to the 12th can be written as i to the 4th, times i to

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,482
the 4th, times i to the 4th. This means we really have i to the fourth repeated

10
00:00:43,482 --> 00:00:48,157
a bunch of times, or really just the multiplication of positive 1. It's easiest

11
00:00:48,157 --> 00:00:51,406
to simplify any power of i by dividing the power by 4 and looking at the

12
00:00:51,406 --> 00:00:56,252
remainder, this will be our new power of i. Once we have our power of i, we

13
00:00:56,252 --> 00:01:00,532
look back to see what it would equal. In this case, we don't need to, since we

14
00:01:00,532 --> 00:01:05,886
have i to the 0, and anything raised to the zero power equals 1. We know our

15
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:09,950
pattern repeats every 4. So if we worked backwards with our pattern. We know i

16
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,148
to the 0 would equal positive 1. So this should definitely make sense with our

17
00:01:14,148 --> 00:01:19,782
pattern. So, if I wanted to simplify i to the 39th, I would do 39 divided by 4.

18
00:01:19,782 --> 00:01:25,780
We know this is 9 remainder 3. This is what I'm interested in. The remainder.

19
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,615
So I know i to 39th is really equal i to the third power. We're going to cycle

20
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:35,852
to this pattern of four. Nine times and then ended up with i cube. We know i

21
00:01:35,852 --> 00:01:39,680
cubed is really equal to negative i. So this power simplifies to negative i. If

22
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:47,750
I want to simplify i to the 50th. I would divide 50 by 4 which is 12 remainder

23
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:54,713
2, so I know i to the 50th is really equal to i squared or negative 1.
