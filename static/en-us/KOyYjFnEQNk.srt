1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,370
So we talked about mandatory
access control models,

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,490
multi-level security models.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,490
And talked with the BLP model for
accessing classified information and

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,530
that's done by individuals or
users who are cleared.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,660
The one question you can ask, well,
does anyone care about this model?

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,920
And if they care enough
do they implement?

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,280
What operating systems
actually implement this?

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,840
So there are four options,

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,540
consider each one of those and
then we'll talk about it.
