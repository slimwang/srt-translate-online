1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,840
So when filtering with a Gaussian, which is true?

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,380
Is it A?

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,720
The sigma is most important.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,310
It defines the blur kernel's scale with respect to the image.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,140
Is it B?

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,740
The kernel's size is most important because it defines the scale.

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,790
C, altering the normalization coefficient, that constant on the front,

8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,730
has no effect on the blurring, it only effects the total brightness.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,390
And D, A and C.
