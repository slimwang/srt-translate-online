1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,010
Other advanced modes that exist are, multiply,

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,840
which basically takes the pixels from both a and b and just multiplies them.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,360
The output of this kind of an image is much darker, again.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,760
Another popular method is screen,

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,810
which actually is represented by this equation.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,540
And if you look at it, what it basically is doing is that screen blend mode.

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,080
The values of the pixels in the two layers are first inverted.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,660
Inverted by again as I said in this case I'm showcasing only values that

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,590
are from 0 to 1 and in this case, inverted because 1 minus a would invert it and

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,680
similarly inverting it for the bottom layer, 1 minus b.

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,180
And then finally again multiplied, and then inverted again.

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,210
So the, in essence, screen is the opposite effect of multiply.

13
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,330
By doing the inversion,

14
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,520
in this case the inversion is done by subtracting from y, 1.

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,790
Again, these are images.

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:57,560
I emphasize that I'm showcasing only images that are from 0 to 1, not 0 to 55.

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,230
As we talked about can take an image from 0 to 255 and scale it and

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,240
space from 0 to 1 also.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,040
Of course the output of this is a brighter image.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,390
A very popular method is overlay, which basically what it

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,610
does is combines a little bit of both multiply and screen.

22
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,600
So in this case, the parts of the top layer where the base layer

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,400
the bottom layer, its light becomes lighter.

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,640
And the parts where the base layer is darker, becomes darker.

25
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,250
So, in essence this kind of combines both those values and

26
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,660
actually gives you much, much nicer way of looking at images again.

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,740
Of course all of them are kind of trying to give you a novel pixel.
