00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's go ahead and expand this node now.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So we're going to add 3 paths.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This one has a path cost of 291

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and an estimated distance to the goal of 380,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
for a total of 671.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This one has a path cost of 239

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and an estimated distance of 176, for a total of 415.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And the final one is 220+193=413.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And now the question is which state to we expand next?
