The linear terms add up to zero, if you got it, great work. We can see that for

2
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:10,190
this problem the positive 4x and the negative 4x add up to 0. This middle terms

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,165
are linear terms, sub is 0. So we're left with x squared minus 16. The same is

4
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:18,613
true down here for this case and for this third case.
