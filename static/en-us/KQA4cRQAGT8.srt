00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,817
Here's our numerator and here's our denominator. Fantastic algebra skills if you

2
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:08,965
got these two correct. This one was really tough, so don't worry if you didn't

3
00:00:08,965 --> 00:00:12,712
get it right on your first try or even at all. Let's see how we can multiply by

4
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:17,865
the LCD and simplify. We know we're going to multiply by the LCD divided by the

5
00:00:17,865 --> 00:00:23,048
LCD. When we do that, we really just distribute this to each term in our complex

6
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:28,326
fraction. This gives us this expression. Now, this is pretty hideous. So let's

7
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:34,034
clean it up. We know x plus 2 divided by x plus 2 equals 1. So we're left with 3

8
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:38,088
times x squared for our first term. This next multiplication was a little

9
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:45,160
tricky. We have x squared divided by x. We can only cancel 1x from this power

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,223
and this denominator. This means we have to drop the squared power down to a 1.

11
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:56,593
And we're left with 4 times 1x times x plus 2. I want to make sure I have it

12
00:00:56,593 --> 00:01:03,842
negative 4 times 1x. So I have negative 4x. Then I had times x plus 2 here. This

13
00:01:03,842 --> 00:01:08,429
denominator is a little bit more simple. These factors simplify to 1 and these

14
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:13,656
factors also simplify to 1. So, we're left with 2 times x squared for the first

15
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:18,140
term of our denominator and 1 times x plus 2 or just x plus 2 for the second

16
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,477
term of our denominator. I need to multiply or distribute this negative 4x to

17
00:01:23,477 --> 00:01:28,428
the quantity x plus 2. This gives me a new numerator. For the denominator, I

18
00:01:28,428 --> 00:01:33,490
don't multiply. I really add, since we have addition between these two terms.

19
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:39,223
Since there aren't any like terms here, I just list out each term, 2x squared

20
00:01:39,223 --> 00:01:42,960
plus x plus 2. And to finish out we just simply combine the like terms in our

21
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,534
numerator. 3x squared minus 4x squared is negative x squared. So here's our

22
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:51,043
final rational expression.
