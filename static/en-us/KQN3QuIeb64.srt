In 3JS a directional light is created and added to a scene by code like this.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,537
The 1st value is the color of the light, in this case the light yellow. The

3
00:00:07,537 --> 00:00:11,656
second is the intensity. Setting the light's position is how you actually set

4
00:00:11,656 --> 00:00:14,950
the vector, by setting 200, 500, 600 we're saying that the light, which is

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,460
infinitely far away, comes from a direction that goes from point 200, 500, 600

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:24,678
to the origin. Note that the length of the direction vector does not matter. We

7
00:00:24,678 --> 00:00:27,765
could of just as easily set 2, 5, 6, or even smaller for the so called position

8
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:30,170
and we'd get the same result.
