Specifically, I want you to do the following. Remove this call to translate.

00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:08,728
We'll re-arrange the pictures in a separate loop. In this loop we will look at

3
00:00:08,728 --> 00:00:13,250
a picture and the one to the left of it. The picture is at index i and the one

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:19,578
to the left at index i minus 1. Call getMaxX on the picture to the left. And

5
00:00:19,578 --> 00:00:22,949
use that value to position pic, go ahead and give it a try.
