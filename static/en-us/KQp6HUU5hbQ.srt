00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,690
Now, let's try to find a general rule for the number of ways that you can get from A to B.

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:12,370
The number of vertices in each of the graphs that I have drawn is 4, 6, 8 and 10.

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,920
When we have four vertices, there are two different ways to get from A to B.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,070
When we have six, there are four different ways. When we have eight, there are eight different ways.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,260
And when we have 10 vertices, there are 16 different ways to get from A to B.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,610
Now my question to you is what if we had 20 vertices

7
00:00:29,610 --> 99:59:59,999
and please again give your answer down here in this box?
