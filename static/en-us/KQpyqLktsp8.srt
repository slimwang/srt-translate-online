1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,855
We have one more pattern to cover with bases and exponents and this involves

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:07,824
division. I can think about expanding 3 to the 4th and 3 squared, just like

3
00:00:07,824 --> 00:00:12,000
before. We can simplify common factors in the numerator and denominator. They

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,244
make 1. Because we're working with a fraction made up of factors, we know these

5
00:00:16,244 --> 00:00:20,816
make 1. So we're left with 3 times 3, or 3 squared. We can think about expanding

6
00:00:20,816 --> 00:00:25,617
these variables as well. We simplify common factors in the numerator and in the

7
00:00:25,617 --> 00:00:30,099
denominator, and we're left with f to the 3rd. This last one is just like the

8
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:34,655
others before except we needed to do something additional for the two numbers or

9
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:39,242
coefficients. I know 6 divides into 12 and 6 divides into 18. 6 into 12 is 2,

10
00:00:39,242 --> 00:00:43,587
and 6 into 18 is 3. So I have 2 3rds times w to the 5th. I've showed you the

11
00:00:43,587 --> 00:00:47,656
expanded form, and the simplification, so that way we could look at the pattern.

12
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:51,777
What's happening as we move from the left side to the right side? What do you

13
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:56,041
notice about the exponents? Let's see if you can answer this with a question.

14
00:00:56,041 --> 00:01:00,562
What's a rule for the pattern that you see over here? You can write your answer

15
00:01:00,562 --> 00:01:04,590
in this box. And be sure that it includes a base of x, and involves your

16
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,073
exponents a and b. What'd you do with them?
