1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,330
The sample size for the placebo group is 5, and we'll multiply that by 1.5

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:12,621
minus 1.835, and then square it. Then we'll add the sample size for drug one

3
00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:19,908
times the mean for drug one minus the grand mean squared. Drug two has 7 in the

4
00:00:19,908 --> 00:00:25,400
sample, which we'll multiply by the squared deviation. And drug three has 4.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,259
After we do all this, we get 5.45.
