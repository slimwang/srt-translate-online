Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,830
In module five, we have covered
a lot of interesting topics,

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,780
starting off with image transformations,
where we learned about how to warp and

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,620
transform images, applied them for
image morphing, then we learned about

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,940
image panoramas and HDR, and
a few other things, like stereo.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,710
Now I want to introduce to you a series
of lectures recorded by my very good

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,880
friend Aaron Bobick, for the Computer
Vision class on camera calibration.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,570
When we talked about HDR and panoramas,

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,100
we talked about the fact that we wanted
to be able to take images and actually

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,640
take the pixels from those images and
model them to the environment.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,690
And of course, that meant the geometry
of the scene, and also the radiometric,

12
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,630
the color information in the scene.

13
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,180
Now, what we want to do here is
talk about calibration in a general

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,170
framework.

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,350
In those lectures,
I talked about relative information.

16
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,360
That is, to take a series of images, and

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,960
the pixels from that could be used to
model relative information in a scene.

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,290
Now we want to be able to do this
in a much more general framework.

19
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,650
What I'm referring to here is a series
of three lectures by Aaron Bobick.

20
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,290
Aaron and I have known each other for
a very long time,

21
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,140
he's been teaching
computer division here.

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,690
He is much more funnier than I am and

23
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,580
of course his interesting lectures
will actually keep you engaged.

24
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,260
This is optional material and
I just want you to watch them, and

25
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,330
it'll give you guidance of what happens
when you want to actually start getting

26
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,740
into things like the photosynth
application that we've looked at

27
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,700
that actually gets 3D
points from scenes.
