1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,670
Alright, so we have installed, GitHub locally, which

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,865
gives us a place to put our files.

3
00:00:06,865 --> 00:00:07,520
>> Mm-hm.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,910
>> We have an account, which gives us a place online to

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,690
have our files. How do we get them to talk to each other?

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:19,330
>> Okay. Well, we're going to need to, sign in. So, let's go to Preferences.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:19,940
>> Okay.

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,880
>> Alright. So, yeah we want to Allow that. Sure.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,650
So that was something about how is sort of makes sure that it's us.

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,920
>> Okay, so now we can access any repositories

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,590
that we have here, but we don't have any yet.

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,579
>> Right so,

13
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,187
>> Go back.

14
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:39,603
>> Were going to need to go actually get the repository

15
00:00:39,603 --> 00:00:39,952
>> Okay.

16
00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:43,360
>> The original repository from GitHub. What

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,280
should I do? Search for that [CROSSTALK].

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,084
>> Yes

19
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:52,931
>> [BLANK_AUDIO]

20
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:54,440
Okay.

21
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,129
>> Alright, so we, so we found his repository.

22
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:56,325
>> Okay.

23
00:00:56,325 --> 00:00:59,220
>> So there are two options here. We could clone it, which

24
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,020
means that we would just have a local version of his repository.

25
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,370
Or, we can Fork it which means that we make our own

26
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,120
copy of the repository that we can then put on our local machine.

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,540
>> Okay, and what should we do?

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,800
>> Since I don't think we, we want to make any changes to his repository,

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,190
I think we want to fork it so that we have our own totally separate one.

30
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,282
>> Okay.

31
00:01:17,282 --> 00:01:19,607
>> [SOUND]

32
00:01:19,607 --> 00:01:22,873
I like.

33
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:23,691
>> It's forking it.

34
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:27,440
>> I like it. So I'm going to Refresh, and there we go.

35
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,220
>> Alright, so now we have our own copy.

36
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,050
>> That is cool. So these are all those files that I had copied and

37
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,930
pasted before. The JavaScript files, the Style

38
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,820
files, and then this Index file. Very cool.

39
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,610
>> Yeah. So now if we go back over here and refresh, it shows up.

40
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:44,920
>> Awesome.

41
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:52,810
>> And we can clone it to our local machine. Alright,

42
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,890
so we now have a copy of the repository on our machine.

43
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,530
>> Okay, great.
