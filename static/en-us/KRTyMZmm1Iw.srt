00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,160
When you create an application,

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,240
you want to test it before
releasing it to your users.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,700
After all, you want to make sure
the features work, right, and

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,750
make sure they're good quality?

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,340
As your application becomes more
complex, it becomes harder and harder to

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,000
manually check if all the features
of your app are working as expected.

7
00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:23,080
Using tests and test frameworks can help
make it easier to automate this process.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,640
It will also change how you think
about the app development process.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,230
In this lesson, you'll learn about
how to test Ruby applications

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,910
using a testing framework
called minitest.

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:34,590
Let's get started.
