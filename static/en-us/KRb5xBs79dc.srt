1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,440
Okay, let's step through
these one by one.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,180
A, Train several parameterized
polynomials of differing degree.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,160
Yes, we could use that to
create an ensemble, but

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,350
that's not the best answer.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,250
B, Train several KNN models
using different subsets of data.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,840
Yes, that's good too, but
it's not yet the best answer.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,630
C, Train several KNN models
with randomized Y values.

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,630
This is, of course, a terrible idea and
would give you mush.

9
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,740
D, Combine A and
B into a super ensemble.

10
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,080
Yes, that is the best answer.

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,682
E, combine B and C.

12
00:00:45,682 --> 00:00:50,770
And of course, that is mush as well and
we're not going to do it.

13
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:56,410
Okay, we're actually going to look now
at this method of creating an ensemble

14
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,600
of learners, training several KNN
models using different subsets of data.
