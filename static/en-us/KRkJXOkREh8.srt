1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,692
Adding 16 to both sides of our equation, gives us y plus 1 equals x squared

2
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:09,500
minus 8x plus 16. All we need to do now is factor the right-hand side of the

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,669
equation to make sure that it fits the form we're looking for. And sure enough,

4
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:19,456
we can factor this to be x minus 4 squared. So, we have a final equation of y

5
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:23,245
plus 1 equals the quantity x minus four squared. Awesome.
