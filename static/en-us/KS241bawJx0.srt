00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's go back to our list of concepts and say what have we done so far and what's next?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We think we did a good job with the dictionary,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and we did a good job with our hands here.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In terms of legal play, well, we've got words, so we're sort of part way there,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but we haven't hooked up the words to the board.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Maybe that's the next thing to do--is say, let's do a better job of hooking up

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the letters and the hand with the words in the dictionary

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and placing them in the right place on the board.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't want to have to deal with the whole board. Let's just deal with one letter at a time.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's say there is one letter on the board,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and I have my hand and I want to say I can play W-O-R and make up a word.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Just to make it a little bit more satisfying than one letter,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
let's say that there is a set of possible letters that are already on the board,

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and we can place our words anywhere,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
but we're not going to worry about placing some letters here and having them run off the board.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We're not going to worry about placing letters here and having them run into another letter.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We're just going to say what words can I make out of my hand that connect

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
with either a D or an X or an L.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So I need a strategy for that. Let's just consider one letter at a time.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What I need to find is all the plays that take letters in my hand--

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
[HANDSIE] let's say those are the seven letters in my hand.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Take those letters and combine them with a D and find all the words.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What can those words consist of?

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
They can have some prefix here, which can be any prefix in our set of prefixes

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
that come solely from the letters in my hand.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Then the letter D that's already there doesn't have to come from my hand.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then some more letters.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll think of this as a prefix plus a suffix where I make sure that I know that D is already there.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Here is word-plays--takes a hand and a set of letters that are on the board,

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and it's going t o find all possible words that can be made from that hand,

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
connecting to exactly one of the letters on the board.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We're going break it up into a prefix that comes only from the hand,

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
then the letter from the board, and then the remainder of the suffix that comes from the hand.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The same structure as we had before--we start off with an empty set of result words.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
In the end we're going to return that set of result words.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Then we're going to go through all the possible prefixes that come exclusively from the hand,

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
then the possible letters on the board, and add a suffix to the prefix plus the letter on the board

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
from the letters in the hand except for we can no longer use the letters in the prefix.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Find_prefixes is just like find_words except we're collecting things that are in the prefixes

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
rather than things that are in the list of words.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Now I want you to write add_suffixes.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Given a hand, a prefix that we found before, results set that you want to put things into,

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
find me all the words that can be made by adding on letters from the hand

44
00:03:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
into the prefix to create words.
