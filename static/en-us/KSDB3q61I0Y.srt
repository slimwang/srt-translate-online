1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,490
Let's go with that, I mean I don't
see anything better than this.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,760
But if you think you can out
Solomon Solomon, more power to you.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,110
>> Well, I believe that there
is a way out Solomon Solomon and

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,250
it really boils down to noting
what Solomon was trying to do.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,860
What was Solomon trying to do?

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,338
>> Solomon was trying, they had private
knowledge of whether they were moms or

7
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:20,260
not, she was just trying to
get them to tell the truth.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,280
>> Right, and
what he was trying to elicit

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,550
in this particular mechanism was
what their preferences were.

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,800
So, this sort of private notion of
whether they were the mom or not,

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,976
what was happening with what
King Solomon was doing was this kind of

12
00:00:34,976 --> 00:00:40,110
assumption that each mom held the baby
and sort of with some kind of value.

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,065
So mom A in this case,
woman A in this case, loves the baby and

14
00:00:46,065 --> 00:00:49,660
assigns some kind of value or
utility to having the baby around.

15
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,880
And woman B also has a value or
utility for

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,301
having the baby around versus having
the baby end up with the other woman.

17
00:00:59,301 --> 00:00:59,980
>> Right.

18
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,280
>> And in particular, there's a value
of the baby to the true mother that is

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,020
higher than the value of
the baby to the fake mother.

20
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,090
>> Maybe, okay.
>> And in this case,

21
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,650
that better be what
King Solomon thought.

22
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,050
Because otherwise why would the fake
mother be okay with cutting

23
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,000
the baby in half?

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,330
>> Again, not necessarily okay,
just not as horrified.

25
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,250
>> Right, well,
that means there's a lower value there.

26
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,090
>> Right.
>> So there's

27
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,070
two values that are that
are actually going on and

28
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,580
let's say there's a value of
the baby for the real mother.

29
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,220
And there's a value of the baby for
the fake mother.

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,568
And really the only thing that we have
to sort of assume here is that the value

31
00:01:35,568 --> 00:01:39,379
of the baby to the real mother is
greater than the value of the baby to

32
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:40,421
the fake mother.

33
00:01:40,421 --> 00:01:44,910
>> Okay, which is also not so
clearly a good assumption?

34
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,317
>> Sure, but it certainly drives what's
going on with King Solomon here.

35
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:52,435
>> If value is like willingness to pay,
it could be that B is really rich but

36
00:01:52,435 --> 00:01:55,880
isn't the mom and A is poor and
can't really pay very much.

37
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,360
But okay, all right,
let's just go with it, so.

38
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
>> I mean if-
>> We

39
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,220
want to know who wants the baby more.

40
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,170
>> Right, who wants the baby more,

41
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,140
sort of the intrinsic value of
the baby to each of the women.

42
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,088
And if you assume that the true
mother cares more about the baby,

43
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:10,847
that is has the baby at a higher value.

44
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:14,800
Then the fake mother then believing
this to be true makes sense.

45
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,990
>> Okay, I'll take it, sure.

46
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,830
>> And if that's not the case,
then you're kind of lost anyway.

47
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,260
So we might as well go ahead and
just sort of assume that this is true.

48
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,120
Anyway, if the fake mom had that
much money, she'll just buy a baby.

49
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,387
>> But
that's what she's trying to do [LAUGH].

50
00:02:24,387 --> 00:02:26,140
>> No, she stole the baby.

51
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,220
>> Good point.
>> Okay, good.

52
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,250
So let's assume that we really believe
that there is a value to the baby to

53
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,090
the real mom and it's greater than the
value of the baby to the fake mom, okay?

54
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,350
So I'm just going to

55
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,440
assert another kind of mechanism
that King Solomon may have used.

56
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,160
>> Okay.
>> And I want you to walk me through it

57
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,630
and see if you believe
that this is good,

58
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,880
bad or the same as what King Solomon
actually did in the story.

59
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,530
Okay?
>> Yeah.

60
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,600
>> All right, so let me write that out.
