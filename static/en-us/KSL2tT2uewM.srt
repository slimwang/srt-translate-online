00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Norvig] I wrote this version of the function,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and as soon as I wrote it, as I was recording this video I set it running.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And you know what? It's still running. It hasn't completed yet.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I've got to admit I've done this before, so I have an idea of how long it's going to take.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But we're in a race with it.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's see if before it completes--

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
we know it's going to take on the order of an hour or so--

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
can we write a program that's better and faster

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and maybe even though that program's got a head start,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
we can catch up with it and finish first?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The problem with this program is it goes through all this work

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to try all the 5 factorial to the 5th combinations

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and then they get ruled out really early.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And some of the combinations, it seems silly that we're bothering with them.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So if the Englishman is not red, we should know that

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
by the time we've got through the second set of assignments here.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Here we've assigned red to some house and Englishman to some house.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If we didn't assign them to the same house,

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
why are we bothering to go through all the possibilities for the other properties?

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And so what we could do is move this constraint up to the earliest time

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
in which both Englishman and red are defined, so there.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now I've moved it up, and now if Englishman is red is false,

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
then we don't even have to bother to go through all 3 of these loops.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So we're going to eliminate a lot of work in just that 1 clause.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Now let's consider another of the constraints.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let's look at immediate right of green and ivory.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Can we move that up? And where can we move it up to?

28
00:01:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Can we move imright(green, ivory) up to here, here, here, or here?
