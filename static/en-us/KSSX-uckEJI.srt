00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,021
>> The first sign point up and to the right so this must have positive flow. We

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:08,117
also know if someone is walking on it, that they would be walking uphill, so we

3
00:00:08,117 --> 00:00:12,225
have positive slope. This line is vertical we can't walk up it, so the slope is

4
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:16,036
undefined. This third line points down and to the right, so it must have

5
00:00:16,036 --> 00:00:20,274
negative slope. Here our line points down and to the right so its also negative

6
00:00:20,274 --> 00:00:25,302
slope. This one would be positive. And this last one would be 0. We have a

7
00:00:25,302 --> 00:00:28,925
horizontal line, so lots of run and no rise.
