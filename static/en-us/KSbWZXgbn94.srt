00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,372
There are two solutions for any given quadratic equation. Let's think back to

2
00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:08,648
how this emerges from the quadratic formula. It comes out of the presence of

3
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:13,136
this plus or minus here in the numerator. This is going to give us two answers,

4
00:00:13,136 --> 00:00:17,538
negative b plus the square root of b squared minus four a c all over two a, and

5
00:00:17,538 --> 00:00:21,940
then the same thing except for a minus sign in between the negative b and the

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,617
rest of the numerator. This also makes sense if we look at the general form for

7
00:00:26,617 --> 00:00:31,221
a quadratic equation as well. We have ax squared plus bx plus c equals 0 and in

8
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:35,455
order to end up with a term involving an x squared in it, because we know that

9
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:39,959
the coefficient a is not allowed to equal 0. We need to be able to multiply 2

10
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:44,495
things together that have a factor of x in them, since that's the only way you

11
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:49,123
can get an x squared down here. That means that either of these factors needs to

12
00:00:49,123 --> 00:00:53,044
be able to be set equal to 0 and give us both solutions. So there are 2

13
00:00:53,044 --> 00:00:53,756
solutions.
