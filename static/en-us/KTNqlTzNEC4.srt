00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,340
Continuous integration is the idea
that you're always making sure your

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,490
code can be integrated with
the remote repository..

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,645
So across a team,
you'll always have a stable build.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,690
Now we won't go into detail on CI,

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,070
as much of it is already covered
in the dev ops udacity course.

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,130
But a key lesson here is that CI in
the cloud provides a great place for

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,860
your time intensive tasks.

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,450
In particular, your unit tests.

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,120
A cloud solution like Jenkins will watch
the commits going into your repository

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,010
and trigger any terminal
commands you feed it.

11
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,971
So if you take the Gulp test task that
we've just created and hook it up in

12
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:36,520
the cloud, it means that the test
suite will run after every commit.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,520
But on a completely different computer,
letting you go in coding.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,990
If one of these tests now fails,
you've got a email and

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,270
can fix it in your next commit.

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,467
We'll leave our task as is for
now, but do go and

17
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:50,540
check out the dev ops Udacity course
when you're finished with ours.
