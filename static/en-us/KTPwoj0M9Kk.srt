1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So coming back to our example, here are the variances again.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let me give you another word that's really important called standard deviation.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The variance by its very nature computes in the quadratic.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's the quadratic deviation from the mean.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In fact, it's the average quadratic deviation from the mean.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If you don't want something quadratic, then you can take the square root of it,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and you get what's called the standard deviation.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In the first case √0.8 is 0.8944, and second case the √148.4 is about 12.18.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is how much you expect the age of an individual family member to deviate

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
from the mean by about 12 years.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Whereas here you expect the deviation to be just below 1 year.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You can see why this is a good approximation.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Here 4 of the 5 kids differ in age by 1 yr

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
whereas here people differ as much as 20 years in age from the mean.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The variance and the standard deviation are much larger.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's practice this.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll give you a couple of quizzes now.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll give you data. I want you to complete the mean for me, the variance and the standard deviation.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
3, 4, 5, 6, 7--please fill in all three of those values.
