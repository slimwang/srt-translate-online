1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,900
Let me just show you some examples
of what we mean by tracking.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,390
And here is some slightly older ones.

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,440
The one on the left here is
this girl jumping around.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,140
You see the little red
ring around her head.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,760
That's, I think that's Andrew Blake's
daughter a long time ago.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,870
I think she's now a lawyer.

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,710
So that tells you something
about the time difference.

8
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,510
Andrew, I have no idea if that's true.

9
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,720
And also from a similar work is
this leaf blowing in the wind.

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,780
And you'll notice,
as the camera zooms in and

11
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,620
out and things move around, it does a
pretty good job of sticking to the leaf.

12
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,530
Both of these examples were work
that Andrew and Michael Isard did in

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,760
the particular type of tracking that
we'll actually do not this lecture, but

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,000
a couple lessons from now.

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,820
Here is a slightly more recent one.

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,100
This is a tracking of body
parts as somebody's moving.

17
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,410
And you can see the,
the reference there.

18
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,240
And again, this is a tracking problem,
but it's tracking with a model.

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,000
Right?
So the idea is I

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,480
want to be able to track
where the parts have moved.

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,490
Here you see a sort of a more
traditional notion of tracking.

22
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,580
But in this case,
it's lots of targets, right?

23
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,760
So there are a lot of people say
walking around in the street here.

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,440
And you'll notice that it
does a really good job

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,550
of keeping track of all the people.

26
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,387
The little box that's
around each one of them and

27
00:01:08,387 --> 00:01:11,050
there's another little
box that's on their head.

28
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,650
Here there's just a little bit of
animation showing you that it's

29
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,740
tracking them through spacetime, right?

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,530
So this volume with these
trajectories through there

31
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,430
are showing you how it's doing
the reasoning over spacetime.

32
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,000
There are a couple of interesting
things to notice here.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,462
Watch this guy going behind the pole.

34
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:31,480
All right, so he goes behind the pole
and he appears the other side.

35
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,740
And you might ask, how does it do that?

36
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,030
>> How does it do that?

37
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,790
>> I'm not going to tell you yet.

38
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,730
I'll tell you soon.

39
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,920
And also here, it's showing you just the
heads that have been tracked to show you

40
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,120
that it's recovered that.

41
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,910
So this is an example of sort of a state
of the art tracking at least of a,

42
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,000
of a couple of years ago.
