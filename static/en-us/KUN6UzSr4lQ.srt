1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,547
Our even functions (those which are symmetric across the y axis) are A, B, and F.

2
00:00:06,547 --> 00:00:10,209
This one, this one, and this one.

3
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:14,735
We have two odd functions in the graph:
graph C and graph D.

4
00:00:14,735 --> 00:00:20,461
And we have one function that is neither even nor odd,
which is this graph E.
