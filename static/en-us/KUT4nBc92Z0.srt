1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,340
For step 8, you're going to
implement the resolveSignInError( ).

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,490
Now we've seen this function
a couple of times already.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,490
We put it behind
the Signing In button and

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,120
we also put it on
the On Connection Failed.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,890
But what should this function do?

6
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,820
It's a pretty complex function.

7
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,860
So give it a try anyway.

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,630
If you get stuck,
the source code is available for you.

9
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,210
But ultimately, what we want it to do is
say, if we don't already have a sign in

10
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,190
intent, then we want to
start an intent server for

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,940
our mSignInIntent that
we created earlier.

12
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,900
This start intent server will use
a request code of RC_SIGN_IN.

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,120
Now, if you remember earlier on when we
tried to sign in, we had to do things

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,150
like selecting the count or
accepting the permission screen.

15
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,560
That's what this intent will do for you.

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,544
Try and implement this function and
check this box when you're done.
