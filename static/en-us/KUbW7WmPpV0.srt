Keep in mind that there are other questions that might be asked. For example,

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:08,016
now that we know x, we can go back and find other values. We could find the

3
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:10,832
speed of the boat against the current, the speed of the boat with the current,

4
00:00:10,832 --> 00:00:14,807
or the distance travelled. For this question, I just want you to tell me,

5
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:19,960
what's the distance travelled in each direction. Type that answer in here.
