00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,020
There are three different logistic
regression algorithms that

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,370
are typically used.

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,550
The one we just looked
at is the default, and

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,940
it is called the logit
transformation equation.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,890
That is what we're going to
focus on in our analysis, but

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,079
let me briefly explain
the other two options.

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,150
The second option is the probit
transformation equation.

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,130
It looks very similar to
the logit formula and

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,680
actually gives a very similar result.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,110
The third section and the last option
is the log-log transformation.

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,940
This is the best option for

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,770
you if you think the percent
change in the predictor variables

13
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,460
will represent the percent
change in the target variable.

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,300
But like I said, we're not going to
focus on these last two algorithms and

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,241
rather just focus on the logit
logistic regression.

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,940
For these and the other models
taught throughout the course,

17
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,950
we're going to stay away from the math.

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:58,810
And instead we'll focus on what the
algorithms are doing conceptually, how

19
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,440
to apply them, and how we can interpret
them inside the Alteryx platform.

20
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,150
We'll be using Alteryx, because most
of the models are outside of what

21
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,960
typical tools like
Excel can actually do.
