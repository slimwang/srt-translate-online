00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,380
When we created the main
restaurant's page,

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,920
we executed a query to get all of
the restaurants in the database.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,780
I will use the ID number
of each restaurant entry

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,380
in order to find a specific
restaurant to update.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,220
Let's go ahead and replace that hash tag
with the ID number and then a slash and

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,200
the word edit to indicate a new path
where we will edit our menu entries.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,310
I will now create another if statement
that looks for slash edit in the URL.

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,360
Since i chose to edit
restaurants by their ID,

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,180
I need to find a way to grab
that ID number out of the URL.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,650
The split command in Python
comes in handy here and

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,590
returns an array of strings
separated by a slash.

12
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,770
I figured out the third value of
this array contains my ID number.

13
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,980
So with this two here,

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,390
I'm grabbing the third element
of this zero indexed array.

15
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,350
I then do a restaurant query
to grab the restaurant entry

16
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,510
equal to the ID in the URL.

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,440
If I find that query then I generate
a response and begin to render the page.

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,500
I create a form with one field for
the new restaurant name.

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,200
Let's create a POST method and
pass in the path for

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,980
the /restaurants/id/edit, passing in
the id of the restaurant I want to edit.

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,209
I also prefilled this field with
the current name of the restaurant.

22
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,900
I close all my tags, and
add this output string to the wfile.

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,042
Now let's write up the post response for
our edit form.

24
00:01:12,042 --> 00:01:14,660
Some of this code might be
starting to look pretty familiar.

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,240
After making another if statement,
we grab the input from our form again.

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,620
Then we perform the query to find
the object with the matching ID.

27
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,470
We reset the name field to
the entry we created in the form,

28
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,650
then add to the session and commit.

29
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,610
I then added a redirect to bring
us back to our restaurants page

30
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,080
after the code has been executed.

31
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,170
This was a lot of code to write,
so let's save and

32
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,560
rerun our server again
to see if it worked.

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,840
If I renamed Panda Garden to
The New Panda Garden look,

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,200
it's been updated in the database and
on our restaurant's page.

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,220
The source code for objective four is
also available in the instructor notes.
