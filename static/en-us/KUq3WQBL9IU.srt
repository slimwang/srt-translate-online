00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,364
The equation of the vertical line that goes through the point negative 5 6 is x

2
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:08,574
equals negative five. What do we know about vertical lines? We know that

3
00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:13,285
vertical lines look like this. We know that vertical lines have undefined slope,

4
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:17,356
and we also know that the equation of a vertical line is always going to be x

5
00:00:17,356 --> 00:00:22,383
equals a constant. Since this vertical line goes through the point Negative 5,

6
00:00:22,383 --> 00:00:27,243
6. We know that no matter what value y is, x is always going to remain at

7
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:33,029
negative 5. So, the equation of the vertical line through the point negative 5,

8
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:38,840
6 is X equals negative 5. For the second problem, the equation of the horizontal

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,400
line that goes to the point negative 5, 6 is Y equals 6. What do we know about

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,596
horizontal lines? We know they go left to right, or right to left. We know that

11
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:56,754
the slope is 0, and we know their equation looks like y equals a constant. Now

12
00:00:56,754 --> 00:01:02,676
if we know that this horizontal line goes to the point negative 5,6, if I plot

13
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:08,692
the point negative 5,6 on this horizontal line what I notice is no matter what

14
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:14,382
value x is, y is always going to be 6. So I get the equation y equals 6. If you

15
00:01:14,382 --> 00:01:17,287
got these answers right, great work.
