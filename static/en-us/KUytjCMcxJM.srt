1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,050
What if your data distribution
looked like this?

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,040
Can you guess the two largest
principle components or eigenvectors?

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,210
Let me give you some options.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,340
Do you think this could be one?

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,730
How about this or these two?

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,820
Remember, you want to pick the first and
second principle component.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,410
Type 1 for lambda 1 and 2 for lambda 2.

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,610
Leave the remaining two boxes blank.
