1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,730
So now we know how to do
predicted value, right.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,560
So the p of x t given
all our measurements.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,780
So given this, and then we take a
measurement at time t, what do we want.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,300
We want the new corrected value, x of t,

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:23,770
given y's through y t so we're folding
in the new measurement, all right.

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,820
The way we're going to do that is we're
going to make use of Bayes Rule, and I'm

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,060
just going to, I have written down here
for those of you who, don't remember

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,180
Bayes Rule and don't have it tattooed
on the, inside of your right thigh.

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,140
But here basically is what we're doing,
right?

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,270
So Bayes rule says that if I want to
know the probability of A given B,

11
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,650
I can flip it around by knowing
the likelihood of B given A.

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,160
And then there are these
other terms in here, okay?

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,920
And you'll notice what we did
here is we switched this around.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,213
This is now the probability of getting
the measurement given all these

15
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:59,720
previous stuff,
times the probability, what is this?

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,440
Well, that's just our prediction,
okay, that's, that's P of A.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,220
And then this, this is going to turn
out just to be a normalization factor.

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,550
By using our independence assumption,
right.

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:17,160
The independence assumption says that
our measurement y t, given x t and

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,870
all this stuff,
is only a function of, x t.

21
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,230
All right?

22
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:27,140
And the reason that I refer to this
bottom part as normalization is,

23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,110
remember this is
a probability over here.

24
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,450
And basically,
they all have to sum to one.

25
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,340
And we'll get to that later.

26
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,055
And this, this bottom value
just normalizes everything so

27
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:37,205
that it sums to one.

28
00:01:37,205 --> 00:01:41,845
And if you really wanted to
calculate that normalization, okay,

29
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:43,575
what you have to do is,

30
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:48,350
you have to compute all the different
possible probability of getting that y t

31
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,840
over all of the x t predictions
over the integral over all the x t.

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,690
But it, we are never ever going to be
sort of computing that bottom part.

33
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,650
That's just there so you can see what
the sort of the total integral is.

34
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,750
And in fact now it says
really a normalization.

35
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,430
So it's really, really a normalization.
