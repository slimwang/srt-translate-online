1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,270
On face value, the next type of partnership is the most unlikely.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:10,800
It's when competitors get together in programs to do something jointly for their industry,

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,740
for example, tradeshows, industry associations, etc.

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,900
It turns out the automobile industry action group has 900 members

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,090
of competitors who also to vie to sell the same products to the auto industry.

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,910
Fashion week in New York, another example.

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:33,180
All the fashion vendors, all the suppliers of high-end fashion get together,

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,950
and actually work together to promote a joint view of the industry.

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,560
So coopetition is another potential area for partners.

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,280
Also, industry specs, technical committees,

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,410
you'll see competitors who normally outside that building

12
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,700
who do nothing better than run each other over with a car

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,830
actually sitting and trying to define a joint technical specifications.
