00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,050
Let us look at the processes that Watson may be using a little bit more closely.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,250
Clearly Watson is doing a large number of things. It is trying to understand

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,650
natural language sentences. It is trying to generate some natural language

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,420
sentences. It is making some decisions. I'll group all of these things broadly

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,460
under reasoning. Reasoning is a fundamental process of knowledge based data.

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,417
A second fundamental process of knowledge based AI is learning.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,500
Watson clearly is learning also. It perhaps gets a right answer to some questions,

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,100
and stores that answer somewhere. If it gets a wrong answer, and then once it

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,060
learns about the right answer, it stores the right answer also somewhere.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,400
Learning too is a fundamental process of knowledge based AI.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,800
A third fundamental process of knowledge based AI is memory. If you're going to

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,220
learn something, that knowledge that you're learning has to be store somewhere,

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,780
in memory. If you're going to reason using knowledge, then that knowledge has to

14
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,250
accessed from somewhere, from memory. From memory process it will store,

15
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,640
what we learn as well as provide access to knowledge it will need for

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,920
reasoning. These three forms of processes of learning, memory, and

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,040
reasoning are intimately connected. We learn, so that we can reason.

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,480
The result of reasoning often result in additional learning.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,200
Once we learn, we can store it in memory. However, we need knowledge to learn.

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,760
The more we know, the more we can learn. Reasoning requires knowledge that

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,470
memory can provide access to. The results of reasoning can also go into memory.

22
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,650
So, here are three processes that are closely related.

23
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,680
A key aspect of this course on knowledge based AI is that we will be

24
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,520
talking about theories of knowledge based AI that unify reasoning, learning,

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,610
and memory. And sort of, discussing any one of the three separately as sometimes

26
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,860
happens in some schools of AI. We're going to try to build, unify the concept.

27
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:05,570
These 3 processes put together, I will call them deliberation. This deliberation

28
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:12,080
process is 1 part of the overall architecture of a knowledge based AI agent.

29
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,339
This figure illustrates the older architecture of an AI agent.

30
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,310
Here we have input in the form of perceptions of the world. And

31
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,990
output in the form of actions in the world. The agent may have large number of

32
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,940
processes that map these perceptions to actions. We are going to focus right now

33
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,230
on deliberation, but the agent architecture also includes metacognition and

34
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,950
reaction, that we'll discuss later
