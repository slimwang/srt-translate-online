00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,210
We call this meme generating app MeMe.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,720
MeMe lets you choose
an image from your phone.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,080
Here I've got some funny
ones of my teammates,

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,598
like this one of Jared in the library.

5
00:00:10,598 --> 00:00:15,460
So I'm going to make a meme
that makes fun of napping and

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,439
API's because he's working
on a networking course.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,080
And then once you've added text to an
image, you can share it with a friend.

8
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:28,570
MeMe stores the memes you've made in
a collection of meme model objects.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,860
And you can browse your
memes in a table or a grid.

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,650
Like most apps it's built
from standard UI components,

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,600
right off the shelf,
which makes it intuitive to use.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,710
At first glance,
this may seem like a daunting task.

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,790
There are probably a lot of
pieces you're not familiar with.

14
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,910
But don't worry.

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,070
By the end of this class,
you'll have the confidence and

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,800
skill to create this app on your own.
