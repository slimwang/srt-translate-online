1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,490
This leads me to the concept
of Photo Tourism or

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,480
sometimes also referred to as
photosynthesis or Photo Synth.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,720
Now this a widely used method
in computer vision, and

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,463
computational photography,
started off by Noah Snavely,

5
00:00:13,463 --> 00:00:17,940
Seitz, Szeliski and they referred to it
as Photo Tourism and their goal was to

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,260
explore photo collections in
3D in reference to each other.

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,650
I will be showing you more
details of this in a bit.

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,880
This was a paper that
was published in 2006.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,310
It's a very interesting idea, and

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,390
I'm going to tell you
more about it in a bit.

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,820
Of course, this was taken
into a complete technology

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,950
preview that's available online for
you to even play around with

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,220
called Photo Synth developed by
Microsoft following this work.

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,100
So, during this lecture, I'm going to
tell you more about both these two

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,900
different technologies, again something
the foundational work in 2006,

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,440
which has been evolved into
a available package online since 2008,

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,200
and of course,
has just been recently updated.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,530
But of course, there are other similar
solutions also available, that I'm going

19
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,900
to introduce you to, and my assumption,
and hope is that you are actually going

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,410
to play around with them, because they
are going to tell you more about what we

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,720
can do with a collection of photographs
and how to use them to showcase space?
