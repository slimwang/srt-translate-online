Welcome to the graduate course on computer networking.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,760
The primary goal of this course is to

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,050
provide a survey of the necessary tools, techniques,

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,170
and concepts to perform research in computer communications. This

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,280
is a project based course, and there will

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,800
be significant emphasis on hands-on experience. In networking, perhaps

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,880
more than many other subjects, realization is key.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,230
You can read about concepts or techniques in a

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,440
textbook, but really the most effective way to learn

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,160
networking is by doing. So, you'll gain a lot

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,060
of hands on experience in this course. Through the

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,970
assignments. In comparison to an introductory networking course, which

13
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,340
you may have taken, this course will provide more

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,820
in depth coverage of networking topics. And, it will

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,190
also offer a crash course in some of the

16
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,300
available tools that are now available for performing research in

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,780
computer networking. You will gain experience, with many of

18
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,580
these tools, through the project based assignments in the course.
