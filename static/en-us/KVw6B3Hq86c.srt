So, what really is slope? Well, here's a line connecting two points, 2,3 and

2
00:00:04,901 --> 00:00:09,831
7,6. If I were to tell you that the slope of this line is 3 over 5, then what do

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:14,720
you think a good general definition of slope would be? Is the slope of a line

4
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:19,831
how many units to the right are moved for every unit that the line goes up? Is

5
00:00:19,843 --> 00:00:24,300
it how many units the line moves up for every unit it moves to the right? Is it

6
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:28,128
the number of units moved vertically plus the number of units moved

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,509
horizontally? Or, is it lastly, the number of units moved vertically minus the

8
00:00:32,522 --> 00:00:34,525
number of units moved horizontally?
