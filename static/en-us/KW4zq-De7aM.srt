1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If this is our hypothesis, we now must devise an experiment to further refine this hypothesis.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's come up with a very simple input where we'd assume that this holds.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If we put in just "foo" without any tags, we would assume that we would get the very same output.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's do this as an experiment.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Here again, we have a buggy function and now let's conduct the experiment.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So we invoke print-html-markup with foo enclosing double quotes.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We press run and the output is foo, without double quote.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So, now we see the output It's not what we'd expected,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
the output being foo without quotes and this again confirm our hypothesis.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We can try this out with even more strings, further strengthening our hypothesis.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So if we put in bar, a very surprising thing is going to happen.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We get bar as output and if we put in just a two quotes,

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
what we get is an empty string, so we get more failures down the way.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This hypothesis is confirmed now by a number of experiments,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
double quotes are stripped from tagged input, but actually we don't even have a new tag

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
so we can actually scratch that.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Double quotes are stripped from general input.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So even if there's no tags, quotes are being stripped away.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now we can actually go and explore the cause-effect chain.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If quotes have been stripped away, there must be a place in the code which does that.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The only place in our code where quotes are handled, is right here in this line.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Here we have: if there's a double quote or a single quote and tag is being set

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
then quote be inverted and when quote is inverted, tags should not be recognized.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Nothing too complicate, but why would the quotes be stripped? Because normally we should not be in tag mode.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Maybe we are in tag mode, maybe the variable tag is set.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So we can come up with a new hypothesis that explains precisely that.
