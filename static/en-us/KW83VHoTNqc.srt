1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,070
Those last few processes were probably a
bit easier than what Andy went through.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,930
I mean, you saw the pain in his face
when the requirements changed and

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,170
when he was reflecting on the process.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,870
If you organize things well it's
much easier to add things later, and

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,190
that's the point.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,210
Separation of concerns is great,
especially when you do it well.

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,660
Now, sadly not all projects
are organized well.

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,410
Every company has legacy code,
even Udacity.

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,790
So how do we deal with it?

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,470
We're going to take a few minutes to
rest our brains, and we'll hear from

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,860
some experts on our software
development team here at Udacity.

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,820
They all had a ton of experience
with writing good code, but

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,950
also have to spend time bringing
legacy code up to date.

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,230
We'll talk to Nick and
Jacques about two opposing methods for

15
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,490
bringing code up to date.
