00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
All right, in this next example software under test is some sort of a web service,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and roll this out

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
onto one of the machines in our cluster, but I'm not going to expose this to most of our users.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What I'm going to do is expose this machine

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
to some small fraction of our users who have been selected, for example,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
based on their willingness and desire to use new features.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The question is what kind of testing is this most like?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Is this integration testing?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Is it differential testing? Is it random testing?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Or is this system/validation testing?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay, so please take a second to go ahead and

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
mark what you believe is the kind of testing that's the best match

13
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
for what it is that we're doing here.
