1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,680
You're almost done with the lesson.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,500
By now you should have a small ado
cluster ready to crunch some data.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,170
Next, I'll show you how to use
an automation tool to deploy

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,720
a larger cluster.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,090
Before you move on,
I provided a dataset for

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,810
you to analyze with your new cluster.

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,360
See you in the next lesson.
