1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,340
Before we go any further.

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,930
It would be great if our view controller
where the recording happens was called

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,880
something other than
just view controller.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,780
In writing your app,

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,600
there are times when you might
want to rename your classes.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,960
And it takes just a minute.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,250
Let me show you.

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,360
To rename our view controller,
we're going to do three steps.

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,460
We want to change the name
of the view controller

10
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,920
to Record Sounds View Controller.

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,987
First, in the project navigator S=select
a viewcontroller.swift file and

12
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:26,750
single click.

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,070
Change the name to record
sounds view controller.

14
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,830
Open the class we just renamed and
change the name in the comments and

15
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,870
in the class decoration to
record sounds view controller.

16
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,800
You can press command
s to save this file.

17
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,520
One last step, we have to tell the
main.storyboard that the view controller

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,760
for this view, is no longer
called ViewController.swift, but

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,968
it's now called
RecordSoundsViewController.

20
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:54,810
Open the main.storyboards file and
select a view controller for

21
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,060
a first view.

22
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,120
Switch to the identity inspector and

23
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,050
change its name to
RecordSoundsViewController.

24
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,490
Press return to make this take effect,

25
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,990
that's all it takes to
change in name of a class.

26
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,380
Next, let's add the AV audio
recorder code you saw earlier.
