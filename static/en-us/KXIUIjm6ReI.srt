1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,500
I'm in main.js, and
I want to find setInterval.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,300
So I'll do it the easy
way by using Cmd+F.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,490
It looks like setInterval is repeating
on a four millisecond timer,

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,550
which is actually a little ridiculous.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,160
In fact, I noticed that as I was
filming, Chrome crashed once or

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,310
twice, and I think this
actually might be the culprit.

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,800
But I'm actually just guessing there.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,020
I'm not sure.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,610
Either way, I will go ahead and
remove that and

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,115
replace setInterval with
requestAnimationFrame.

11
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:28,960
Okay, now, that's simple enough but

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,640
remember, the function itself also
needs to call requestAnimationFrame.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,490
Here's the function captureFrame
which is running the animation.

14
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,489
And inside, I will make another call
to requestAnimationFrame to the same

15
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:42,670
function.

16
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,990
I'll save it, and
let's see what it looks like.

17
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,420
Inside the app's directory,
I'll run gulp serve.

18
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,167
It looks like this site has finished
building, so I'll click Allow.

19
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:55,090
All right, and
it looks like it's working.

20
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,000
Let me take a look at the timeline.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,190
It looks like that, yes,

22
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,710
in fact, animation frame fired
is being called over and over.

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,122
So it looks like the job here is done.

24
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:06,170
All right, well,
now it's on to the Web Worker.
