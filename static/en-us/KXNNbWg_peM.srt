1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,900
So my favorite context aware application is Netflix. So,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,930
I use the smartphone application to scroll through content

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,880
and find what I want to watch. Then I Chromecast

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,946
it to my TV. The application understands that context

5
00:00:11,946 --> 00:00:14,913
switch. So my smartphone application then becomes my remote

6
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:17,309
control, as I'm focused on watching the content on

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,440
my TV. It's really cool how it switches between

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,885
a media player, and a remote control depending on

9
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:22,010
>> Yeah.

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,240
>> What you're doing with it.

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,790
>> And my favorite context aware app

12
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,680
is, Agent. We mentioned this earlier. It's a fantastic

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,060
application that takes advantage of, really processing those signals

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,340
that are generated by a whole bunch of sensors.

15
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,650
And making sense of them, so that I don't get

16
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,220
disturbed when I'm sleeping, when I'm in meetings and,

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,020
and on and on. Not only that, but it

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,800
uses location sensors and it even tells me where

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,840
I might have parked my car. Which is really cool.

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,000
>> Yeah.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,010
>> And the, and the, and the coolest thing

22
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,020
is, I don't even have to interact with this application,

23
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,180
for it to work for me. Which is another thing I love about it.
