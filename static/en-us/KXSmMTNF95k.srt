00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:05,400
Anova effect size measure for one way Anova is called eta squared. This is just

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,564
like r squared from our discussion of t tests. This is the same interpretation

3
00:00:10,564 --> 00:00:15,433
in ANOVA. This effect size tells us the portion of total variation that is due

4
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:21,710
to between group differences. This is also called explained variation. Knowing

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,900
this, how should we calculate n squared check all that apply
