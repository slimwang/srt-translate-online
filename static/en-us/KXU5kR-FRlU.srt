00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,700
So we've asked a lot of you in this course.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,540
We asked you to think about who the end user is

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,240
and their use cases. We asked you to take into consideration

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,745
the mobile user and their constraints and now we're asking you

5
00:00:09,745 --> 00:00:13,350
to build context aware applications. You might be thinking that sounds

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,760
really difficult. I would really love to make an application that

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,440
senses whether my user is asleep or awake, but how would

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,750
I even go about doing that? Are there APIs for that?

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,830
>> Well, yes there is, and those APIs

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,440
are called Google Play services. They're an awesome

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,410
set of APIs that you can use today to make your applications context aware by,

12
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,390
for example, sensing of the users walking,

13
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,530
sleeping, running, and so on. Remember that Chromecast

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,160
example from Netflix? You can even cast

15
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,140
two Chromecast using this API. So there's a

16
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,740
whole host of things you can do that

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,700
can make your applications really awesome on Android.

18
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,650
>> So, let's bring it back to Dorm Room Debbie. Go to

19
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,810
Google Play Services documentation and research it. Explore around a little bit.

20
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,690
See if you can find a really awesome API, that you could use to plus 1, Dorm

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,170
Room Debbie's Pizza application. Come up with a

22
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,790
really great idea, and post it to the Forum.
