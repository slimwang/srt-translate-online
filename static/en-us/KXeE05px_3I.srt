00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,870
In this lesson we will talk about viruses and internet worms. Let's first

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:10,230
define what a virus is, and then define what a worm is. A virus is

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,800
effectively an infection of an existing program

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,840
that results in the modification of the

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,880
original program's behavior. A worm is code

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,330
that propagates and replicates itself across the network.

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:31,650
A worm is usually spread by exploiting flaws in existing programs or

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,360
open services whereas viruses typically require

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,200
user action to spread. For example, opening

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,990
an attachment on an email or running an executable file that a friend gave

11
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:50,760
you on an USB key. Worms propagate automatically. We will focus most

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,350
of our attention on internet worms. But before we dive into the details

13
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,590
of internet worms, let's first talk about

14
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,310
the different types of viruses. A parasitic

15
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,319
virus typically infects an existing executable

16
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,990
file. A memory- resident virus infects running

17
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,660
programs. A boot-sector virus spreads whenever the

18
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,410
system is booted. A polymorphic virus encrypts

19
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,790
part of the virus program using a randomly generated key. So one of the key

20
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:27,250
differences between viruses and worms is that viruses typically

21
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,740
spread with manual user intervention. Worms

22
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,760
typically spread automatically by scanning for

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,670
vulnerabilities and infecting vulnerable hosts when

24
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,640
those vulnerabilities are discovered. A worm might

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,680
use any of these techniques to infect a particular host before spreading

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,890
further. In the rest of the lesson we will first talk about a brief history

27
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,570
of internet worms, including the first Internet

28
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,960
worm, called the Morris worm, and other

29
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:06,120
famous Internet worms from the early days of Internet worms in the early 2000's,

30
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,710
including Code Red and other well-known Internet worms of the time. We'll

31
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:16,810
then talk about how to model the spread of a worm, in terms of scanning and

32
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,090
infection rates, using analogies from epidemiology. Finally,

33
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,260
we'll talk about design techniques for designing

34
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,350
super fast-spreading worms. And we'll look at

35
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,754
an example of a super fast-spreading worm.
