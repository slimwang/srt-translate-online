1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:08,330
So far we have seen that the variables f1 and f2 are linearly correlated.

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,410
In this case, we decided to use f0 and

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,580
f1 as the variables of interest for building our model.

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,720
Now we want to form a general model that involves f0 and f1.

5
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,184
What are our choices?

6
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:31,060
We could build a parametric model we could build a non-parametric model which

7
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:37,610
would both be statistical models or we could build some mathematical model.

8
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,060
We could also try to build some.

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,060
Machine learning models we using clustering and so on.

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:49,374
In our case, we'll choose the simple non-parametric model.

11
00:00:49,374 --> 00:00:54,130
We will use the method of kernal density estimates to

12
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,240
build a non-parametric model.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,460
We choose this because in a lot of statistics classes,

14
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,330
you would have probably seen parametric.

15
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,320
Models already.

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,580
Since we are going to introduce kernel density estimates here we are going to

17
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,890
stick to single variable approach.

18
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,480
To do so we are going to use a derived feature.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,890
The derived feature we will use will be defined as x,

20
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,260
which is the absolute value of the difference between f naught and f1.

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,600
Divided by the value of f naught.

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,970
This feature by itself is scaled to the values of f naught.

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,880
Thus we expect the range of the variable x to be between zero and one.
