Now, let's think of another thing that we
can count. How about something simple like

2
00:00:04,897 --> 00:00:09,510
cupcakes. Let's say that one of your
friends bakes a bunch of cupcakes for your

3
00:00:09,522 --> 00:00:15,102
birthday party. He bakes 50 cupcakes. You
are a very popular person. So a ton of

4
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:20,030
people come and the cupcakes are really
delicious, so pretty much everyone eats at

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,255
least one. Halfway through the party
people start coming up to you and asking

6
00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:28,951
you how many cupcakes are left. You look
around and realize that you can't seem to

7
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:34,153
find any cupcakes anywhere. They must have
all been eaten. Can you tell your friends

8
00:00:34,153 --> 00:00:40,816
that there aren't any cupcakes left using
a natural number? Please pick yes or no.
