1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I want to use a few words of terminology.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This, again, is a Bayes network, of which the hidden variable C

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
causes the still stochastic test outcomes T1 and T2.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And what is really important is that we assume not just

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that T1 and T2 are identically distributed.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We use the same 0.9 for test 1 as we use for test 2,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but we also assume that they are conditionally independent.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We assumed that if God told us whether we actually had cancer or not,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
if we knew with absolute certainty the value of the variable C,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that knowing anything about T1 would not help us make a statement about T2.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Put differently, we assumed that the probability of T2 given C and T1

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
is the same as the probability of T2 given C.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This is called conditional independence, which is given the value of the cancer variable C.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If you knew this for a fact, then T2 would be independent of T1.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's conditionally independent because the independence only holds true

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
if we actually know C, and it comes out of this diagram over here.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If we look at this diagram, if you knew the variable C over here,

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
then C separately causes T1 and T2.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So, as a result, if you know C, whatever counted over here

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
is kind of cut off causally from what happens over here.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That causes these 2 variables to be conditionally independent.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So, conditional independence is a really big thing in Bayes networks.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Here's a Bayes network where A causes B and C,

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and for a Bayes network of this structure, we know that given A,

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
B and C are independent.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's written as B conditionally independent of C given A.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So, here's a question.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Suppose we have conditional independence between B and C given A.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Would that imply--and there's my question--that B and C are independent?

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So, suppose we don't know A.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We don't know whether we have cancer, for example.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What that means is that the test results individually are still independent of each other

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
even if we don't know about the cancer situation.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please answer yes or no.
