00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,500
Now all of these examples, we're accessing a live

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,400
site. But you can also setup Port Forwarding to

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,960
allow your mobile device to access a local server

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,690
on your development machine over USB. Let's take a look.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,750
To do this, you want to make sure you have

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,050
a server running on your local development machine. In

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,840
this case, I'm going to use Python's simple HTTP

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,740
server on Port 9999. Now to verify that it

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,310
is actually working, I'm going to access that on

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,810
the local machine and it's working fine. If I

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,650
want to now access that same page on my

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,160
mobile device, I need to set up Port Forwarding. I

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,000
can go back to the Chrome Inspect page, click on Port Forwarding and set up a

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,740
port forwarding rule. In this case, port 9999 on local host or

15
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:58,080
IP address 127001. I enable Port Forwarding and click on Done.

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,490
When I refresh this page, you'll see that Port Forwarding is

17
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,510
now running on Port 80 80, and 99 99. At this point,

18
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:15,150
we're all set up. So let's try it out. I'll open a new tab, navigate

19
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,630
to localhost 9999 on the mobile device. And voila, the page is ready to go.
