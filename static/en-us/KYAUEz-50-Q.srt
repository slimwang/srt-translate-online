1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,036
Gallons of gasoline is not a construct, because we already have a way of

2
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:10,388
measuring it in gallons. Intelligence is a construct. How do we measure and

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,135
define intelligence? We have the IQ test, or maybe we could measure intelligence

4
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:21,645
with grades. But grades may also help us measure something like how hard we're

5
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:27,987
working. Like effort. Effort is a construct. We might measure effort by how many

6
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:33,516
minutes we spend working on homework or by grades, or GPA. Age is also a

7
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:39,535
construct. If I had put age in years, I would have defined age as the number of

8
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:45,366
years you've been living but some people might look at age as how mature you

9
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:46,258
are.

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,907
Here I didn't put a way of measuring it, and age therefore is kind of tricky,

11
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:56,029
would be considered a construct in this case. So maturity, age in years, and

12
00:00:56,041 --> 00:01:01,124
wisdom are all three different ways you could possibly measure age. Hunger is

13
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:06,515
also a construct. Hunger could be measured by how often your tummy grumbles or

14
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:12,790
by how deficient in nutrients your body is. Annual salary in US dollars, is not

15
00:01:12,802 --> 00:01:19,090
a construct. That's because we put in US dollars. And therefore we have a way of

16
00:01:19,102 --> 00:01:25,338
measuring your annual salary. And finally itchiness is a construct. How would

17
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,160
you define and measure itchiness? I'll let you ponder that one yourself. We have

18
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:34,973
to think carefully about how to define and measure constructs. The descriptions

19
00:01:34,985 --> 00:01:39,688
for constructs that we settle on, and that allow us to measure them, are called

20
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,347
our operational definition.
