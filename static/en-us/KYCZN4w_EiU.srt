1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,760
So let's look at the two
options we have here.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,160
First one says, file permissions
can change after an open call.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,540
Remember checking was done
when an open was formed.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,500
This call was made, this call complete,

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,270
that's when we down to the IO table or
the file meta-data table,

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,680
setup the open file table entry, return
an index, all the checking got done.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,930
Well at that time, this user lets
Alice was able to read the file.

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,890
Later on, Bob who owns the file comes
and turns read permission off for Alice.

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,230
But Alice's process is still running.

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,800
And Alice's process to actually read
the open before Bob was able to

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,220
revoke this permission.

12
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,860
And Alice's process hasn't
closed the file yet.

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,090
Will Alice be able to
continue to read this file?

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,540
Yes, because we're not
performing any more checks.

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,110
The checks were done at the time
when we opened the file, okay?

16
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,750
So it was separated from the use.

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,680
So the check was during an open( ) call,
okay?

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,450
So sequence here is Alice did open,
sometime after that Bob comes and

19
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,830
removes the permission, and

20
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,650
sometime after that Alice is
trying to read this file.

21
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,990
Alice is doing read not open now,
so there's no check happening.

22
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,278
So if file permissions change after
an open ( ) call, it completes, but

23
00:01:14,278 --> 00:01:18,772
before it's closed, Alice has the file
open, hasn't closed it, because if she

24
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:22,810
closes it, and then it has to be
opened again, we'll check again.

25
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,270
And when we check again, Bob's
change might be seen by the system.

26
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,540
So if permissions change
between the time we check and

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,970
the time we use, well,
that actually is the reason for

28
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,520
this vulnerability talked to
vulnerability that we're talking about.

29
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,750
And the second option is saying,

30
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,720
the file permissions only change when
the file is currently not opened by any

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,380
program, then this
vulnerability will not arise.
