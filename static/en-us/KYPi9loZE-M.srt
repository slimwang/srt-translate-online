1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer, of course, is:

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Fetching documents are good with GET requests,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and requests that can be cached.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
GET requests are often cached--

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
not always--you can control that with headers but, generally, yes.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
For updating data on the Server, a POST request is more appropriate.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Likewise, sending a lot of data to the Server--

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
a POST request is also more appropriate

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
because, of course, the amount of data

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
you can send in a GET request is limited.
