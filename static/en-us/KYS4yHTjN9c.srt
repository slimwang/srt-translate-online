00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,220
Historical financial data
is of course essential for

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,510
effective financial research.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,780
One reason people are attracted to
finance as an area of research,

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,530
is because they believe the data
is very well documented.

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,360
In other words, all the data is
monitored and recorded by computer and

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,050
saved for us to pore over later.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,460
It turns out though that there
are many ways the data can be faulty.

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,960
In this lesson, we're going to look
at how missing data can occur and

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,840
what we can do about it.
