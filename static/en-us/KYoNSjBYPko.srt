00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,580
In the analysis of the algorithm for
polynomial identity verification,

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,570
I avoided the word probability because
we haven't defined what it means yet.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,460
We'll do that now and
use the algorithm to illustrate

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,000
the meaning of the abstract
mathematical terms.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,220
A discrete probability space consists of
a sample space omega, that is finite,

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,890
or accountability infinite.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,220
This represents the set
of possible outcomes for

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,220
whatever random process we are modeling.

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,160
In the case of the previous algorithm,
this is the value x that is chosen.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,700
A discreet probability space
also has a probability function

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,850
with these three properties.

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:39,030
It must be from the set of subsets
of the sample space to the reals.

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,900
Typically, we call a subset of
the sample space an event, say E.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,400
For every event, the probability
must be at least 0 and at most 1.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,400
The probability of the whole
sample space must be 1, and for

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,090
any pairwise disjoint collection
of events, the probability

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,320
of the union of the events must
be the sum of the probabilities.

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,640
To illustrate this idea
with a polyequal example,

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,510
let's define the event Fi to be the set
consisting of the single element i.

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,870
This corresponds to i being
chosen as the value at which we

21
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,380
test the polynomials.

22
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,540
And we define the probability
of Fi as one over omega,

23
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,530
the size of our sample space or
one over 100d.

24
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,230
Now these Fi aren't
the only possible events.

25
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,310
They're just the single element
subsets of the sample space.

26
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,760
We need to define our
function over all subsets.

27
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,876
But actually we've done some implicitly
already because of this property here.

28
00:01:40,876 --> 00:01:45,359
For any subset s of the sample space,
we have that this subset is

29
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,190
the union of some Fi, the individual
elements of the sample space.

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,310
These are all disjoined, so

31
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,779
the probability of the union is the sum
of these individual probabilities.

32
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,220
And so the result is that the overall
probability is the size of the set,

33
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,210
s, divided by the size of the sample
space, as we would expect.

34
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,950
Let's now confirm that this function
meets all of the criteria for

35
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,110
the definition.

36
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,020
This third property holds because
the size of a disjoint union

37
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,190
is the sum of the sizes
of the individual set.

38
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:25,680
Clearly the probability of the whole
sample space is one, as we see from this

39
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,230
ratio here and the probability of
any event is between zero and one.

40
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,730
So this example here is in fact
a discrete probability space.

41
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,130
By the way, this probability
function is called uniform,

42
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,890
because the probability of
every single element event,

43
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,000
that is to say the Fi here,
they're all the same.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,580
Not all probability
functions are like that.
