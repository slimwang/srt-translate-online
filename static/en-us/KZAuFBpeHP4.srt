1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,830
There are various options of indexing.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,610
And that gives NumPy
indexing great power.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,690
NumPy array can be indexed
with other arrays.

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,810
It is just one other tool
which can be used to make

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,130
process of accessing
values in array easy.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,140
To start with, we create a one
dimensional array of five random values.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,470
Next we create a variable indices
which is also a one dimensional array.

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,490
But the elements of this array,
which is 1, 1, 2, 3,

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,509
are actually the index
we need to access.

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:38,420
That is, we want the value at index 1,
again at 1, 2, followed by 3.

11
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,560
Next step we learn how to use
this indices along with the edit

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,860
to access the desired values.

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,740
Yes, you saw that right.

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:52,150
Just passing the area of indices to
another area will give us the values.

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,190
Let's check the output.

16
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,220
So here is the output.

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,590
Observe that the length
of the indices array and

18
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,150
the returned array is the same.

19
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:08,701
Also it return value from
array a at index 1,1,2,3.

20
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:12,503
It is a bit difficult to understand
the application of this now, but

21
00:01:12,503 --> 00:01:16,330
this is a tool you would like
to use once you get hold of it.

22
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,060
We can do such indexing using
multidimensional array as well.

23
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,090
But things get complicated with
creating multi-dimensional index array.

24
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,020
These are just a few
interesting ways of indexing.

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,670
There are a lot more out there for
you to experiment with.

26
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,390
