00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,420
Many widely used operating systems
don't support mandatory access control,

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,680
like BLP models.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,740
And hence, cannot be in a TCSEC
division higher than what?

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,100
Okay, so the two options here, D and C.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,510
So you're saying,

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,790
if you don't implement MAC, I know you
can't be higher than either D or C.

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,240
Well, if you can't be higher than D,
then you can't be higher than C either.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,310
See which option here makes sense in
terms of, if you didn't do something,

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,820
what division could you go into?
