x squared and 2x have a common factor of x. So for the first two terms we can

2
00:00:05,329 --> 00:00:10,533
rewrite them as x times the quantity x plus 2. The second two terms have a

3
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:15,886
common factor of 3. And that will leave x plus 2 inside these parenthesis.

00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:20,710
Awesome. Maybe now you can see that there's a method to my madness.
