1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,750
So the idea behind the example
we've seen so far,

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,950
has been that basically we're
interested in controlling illumination.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,280
We can control illumination
with a camera, and

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,240
that will allow us to extract various
types of information from a scene.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,960
So, given a control lights, we can
basically scan or re-light a scene.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,190
Scan to extract 3D information,
re-light to be able to then be able

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,470
to generate novel images with
different lighting conditions.

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,800
So, one big question now comes up is,

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,350
how can we actually do much more
elaborate computer control of light?

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,140
In the previous example, we basically
showed how we can use an iPhone display

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,160
itself to light a scene or how we can
use LEDs which are computer controlled.

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,870
But now we want to actually be able to
do much finer control of the light.

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, that's where projectors come in,
because projectors can be thought of.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,710
And these days, with projectors
with micrometer devices and

15
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,890
stuff like that, and the high intensity
light that they actually can generate,

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:02,560
can be used as really detailed types
of controllable light sources.

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,650
Let's see how we can use them.
