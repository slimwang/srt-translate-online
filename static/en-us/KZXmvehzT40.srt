1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,370
Alright Michael.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:01,980
>> So.

3
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,810
>> You think you got an answer?

4
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,560
>> Yeah. It's interesting. So I guess it

5
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,300
really does make some intuitive sense that the

6
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,090
line is really, really nailed down by the

7
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,270
points close to it. And the points that are

8
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,980
far away from it, really don't have any

9
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,870
influence. So I would put non zero, sorry, I

10
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,590
would put zero alphas on the lower left

11
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,800
hand minus and the, one of the upper pluses.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,990
>> Yes, and, you know, I haven't actually worked out the answer here.

13
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,630
But, both of these pluses probably don't matter.

14
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,740
Certainly, this one doesn't. certainly, this minus doesn't

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,372
matter. Maybe this one doesn't matter, either. But

16
00:00:34,372 --> 00:00:36,910
the point that she raises, is exactly right. The,

17
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,640
the points that are far away from the

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,980
decision boundary, and can't be used to define

19
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,190
the contours of that decision boundary. Don't matter,

20
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,620
whether they're plus or minus. Does that make sense?

21
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,380
>> Yeah, cool.

22
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,310
>> Does this remind you of anything?

23
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,960
>> Nearest neighbors?

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,390
>> That's almost always the answer. Why

25
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,165
does it remind you of nearest neighbors?

26
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:56,860
>> because only the local points matter?

27
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,130
>> Oh, that's a good answer. I was going to

28
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,420
have a different answer. Know what my answer was?

29
00:00:59,420 --> 00:00:59,850
>> What?

30
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,690
>> It's like KNN except that you already

31
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,750
done the work of figuring out which points actually

32
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,210
matter. So you don't have to keep all of them. You can throw away some of them.

33
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,450
>> Oh, I see. So it doesn't just take the nearest ones, it actually

34
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,380
does this complicated quadratic program to figure

35
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,980
out which ones are actually going to contribute.

36
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,230
>> Right, so it's just another way of thinking

37
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,180
about instance-based learning, except that rather than

38
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,940
being completely lazy, you put a lot,

39
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,360
some energy into figuring out which points

40
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,590
you could actually stand to throw away.

41
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,920
>> Interesting.

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,350
>> Okay. Yeah, I think that's kind of interesting. I think it's kind of

43
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,420
cool. So good. So you got that. Well let me show you one more thing,

44
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,110
Michael. Alright, so you got this notion of there being very few of the, the

45
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,460
support vectors that you need, but I

46
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,030
want to point out something very important about

47
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,740
some of the parameters in this equation. So

48
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,310
we just got through talking about the alphas,

49
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,006
right? Basically the alphas say, pay attention to

50
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:52,240
this data point or not. But if you look

51
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,930
carefully at this equation, the only place where the xs come into play with one

52
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:02,034
another is here. So Michael, generally speaking,

53
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:08,120
given a couple of vectors, what does xi transpose xj actually mean?

54
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,710
>> It's the dot product.

55
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,200
>> Right, and what is the dot product?

56
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,570
>> It's like the projection of one of those onto the other right?

57
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,270
>> Yeah, and that ends up giving you what?

58
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,160
>> A number.

59
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,630
>> Yes. Does that number kind of represent anything? And if you

60
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,210
say the dot product, I will climb through the screen and kill you.

61
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,560
>> What about the length of the projection.

62
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,276
>> Right, and what does that kind of represent for you?

63
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,470
>> Well, I guess in particular if the x's are,

64
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,640
well if there are five going to each

65
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,600
other than it's going to be zero. But if they

66
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,160
kind of point in the same direction, they're going to be,

67
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,790
it's going to be a large value, and if they

68
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,380
put in opposite directions it's going to be a negative

69
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,960
value. So it's sort of kind of indicating how

70
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,300
much they're pointing in the same direction. So, I

71
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,615
guess it could be a measure of their similarity.

72
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:54,520
>> Rightl, I think that is, that is exactly right. This is the kind of

73
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,630
a notion of similarity. So if you look at this equation, what it basically says.

74
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,860
Find all pairs of points. Figure out which ones matter

75
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,970
for, for defining your decision boundry. And then think about how

76
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,920
they relate to one another in terms of their output

77
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,320
labels. With respect to how similar they are to one another.
