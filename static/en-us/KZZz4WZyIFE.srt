00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,139
When we talked about rational numbers, we
said that they are numbers that can be

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:09,970
written as ratios of integers. Irrational
numbers are numbers that are not rational,

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:15,455
so they are numbers that can't be written
as ratios of integers. We've seen that

4
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:21,177
rational numbers are either integers or
have decimals that either end or repeat.

5
00:00:21,177 --> 00:00:26,265
Irrational numbers, therefore, have
infinitely long decimals that don't follow

6
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:30,831
any sort of pattern. Perhaps the most
common way that we run into irrational

7
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:35,264
numbers is through taking square roots of
numbers that are not perfect squares, just

8
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:40,600
like we tried to do with the slide
example. There are some other numbers that

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,535
have special roles in math and physics
that are also irrational, like the number

10
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:57,402
E, which is about equal to
2.71828182845... or pi. Please remember

11
00:00:57,402 --> 00:01:00,647
that I have just rounded off these
decimals because I don't want to write any

12
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:05,510
more numbers, but like all the other
irrational numbers, pi and e have

13
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:11,083
infinitely many numbers in the decimals
and they do not repeat. So now we've

14
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:15,272
developed a whole world of numbers that
fit most things that we need to count,

15
00:01:15,272 --> 00:01:20,226
measure, and calculate in every day life.
There are still more types of numbers that

16
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:25,911
we haven't touched on yet. Let's look at
the whole entire world of numbers just for

17
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:32,429
a second. Let's start with the natural
numbers, such as 3 and 718. We then went

18
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:37,644
from the natural numbers to the whole
numbers by adding 0 to that set. And on to

19
00:01:37,644 --> 00:01:44,647
the set of integers by adding the negative
whole numbers. From the integers we get to

20
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:52,631
rational numbers by creating ratios of
integers with a non-0 denominator. Those

21
00:01:52,662 --> 00:01:57,865
numbers which are not rational are known as
irrational numbers, such as e and pi. They

22
00:01:57,865 --> 00:02:04,265
have infinitely long, non repeating
decimals. Finally, we get to real numbers,

23
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:09,354
which include the rational and irrational
numbers we have discussed this far.
