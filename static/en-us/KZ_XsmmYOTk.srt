1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,980
What happens if we start looking at the Fourier spectra, for real images?

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,730
So here of course, bricks.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,180
In the previous case I showed you simple examples of just stripe patterns,

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,320
here of course has some structure like this, this is of course a rooftop,

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,969
also has a nice structure, and of course, much more natural scene like grass,

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,320
this of course, are human made of samples, this is,

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,770
of course, purely natural, this spectrum of this one, if you notice,

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,750
does have two dominant directions, one, of course, in this direction,

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,070
the other one also because there are repetitions in this axis too, so you

10
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:42,080
could see a dominant two axis here, shown by of course, these two variations.

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,170
What would be your guess for this image here?

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,750
If you notice, yes, there is a dominant direction because this way, but

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:55,500
if you were to look carefully, there is repetition going on in this axis too,

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,440
and therefore you see, this axis here.

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,670
See the domain, the axis are visible here and

16
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,830
this way, and this one's because primarily there is a,

17
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,410
dominant direction repeating this way, in addition to one of course this way.

18
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,240
And you can see that or hopefully clearly in this one.

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,900
For this one, there's no dominant direction but

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,880
actually some may claim that frequency repeats on equally in all directions if

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,380
you were to look at it, and that's showcased very well by,

22
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,760
this frequency transform here, it's distributed equally in all directions.

23
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:29,840
Of course, so far,

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,380
we haven't talked about the magnitude, we'll get to that also.
