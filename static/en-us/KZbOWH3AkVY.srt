00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,990
So we've all used our phones to send out text messages. But sometimes there is a

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,280
need for code to send texts. Consider the

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,360
following. Taxi companies send out text messages to

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,730
their passengers informing them of the cab driver's

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,200
location. Dating websites help potential couples communicate with

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,130
each other while using texts, but without sharing

00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,520
phone numbers. To make authentication more secure Gmail sends

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,590

00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,710
then use in addition to their

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,840
password. Retail organizations communicate daily deals to

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,010
their customers, while using texts. This use case seems important to a lot

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,630
of different companies, but what does it have to do with classes and objects?
