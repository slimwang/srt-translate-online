1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,860
In this scenario, you're working
on an app called Health Check, and

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,382
what HealthCheck is is basically
an app that administers a quiz, and

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:11,350
that quiz can tell the person who's
using it how healthily they're living.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,331
The questions appear in this box here,
and the user can answer either Yes,

5
00:00:16,331 --> 00:00:20,526
Sometimes, or No, and let's say there's
about 100 different questions, and

6
00:00:20,526 --> 00:00:24,740
they range from things like, do you
exercise more than three times a week?

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,140
Do you drink less than two
caffeinated drinks a day?

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,840
Or, do you have a supportive
social network?

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,490
Now, the questions are phrased in such
a way that when you say Yes, that always

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,410
means you're more healthy and when you
say No, it means you're less healthy.

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,240
Sometimes is sort of
an inconclusive answer.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,980
And what the app is doing is
really keeping track of a score.

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,890
When you hit Yes,
it adds 1 to the health level.

14
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,300
When you answer Sometimes,
it remains unchanged, and

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,260
when you answer No,
it subtracts 1 from the health level.

16
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,940
Also, once you've selected
one of these options,

17
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,800
it'll show you a summary of
what you just answered and

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,020
what your current health level is
before giving you the next question.

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,470
We're just going to look at
the interaction between clicking one of

20
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,360
these buttons and showing the summary
of where you're at right here.

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,310
Let's look at the code.

22
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,130
Okay, so here's the code, and I've also
provided it in the instructor notes,

23
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,250
if you want to take a look at
the sort of text version of this.

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,120
Again, it's not the complete code.

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,700
These little ellipses here mean
that there's code before and

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,560
after the methods that
you're shown here.

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,955
So how does this work?

28
00:01:21,955 --> 00:01:25,850
Well,.when you hit the Yes button,
the yes method is called.

29
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:31,210
This increases the healthLevel, makes a
message, and then displays that message.

30
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:36,030
Similarly, when you hit the Sometimes
button, the sometimes method is called.

31
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,840
The only difference here is that
instead of adding 1, you add 0,

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,640
which means that the variable
value doesn't really change.

33
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,770
And the format is similar
when you hit the No button.

34
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,520
The no message is called,
1 is subtracted from the healthLevel and

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,740
a message is printed.

36
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,230
Okay, we have two variables in this
program, healthLevel and message.

37
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,860
Let's look at message first.

38
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,510
So my first question to you is,

39
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,610
from the code that you see here,
is message a local or global variable?
