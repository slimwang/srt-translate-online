00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,120
Now let's illustrate Diffie-Hellman key
exchange algorithm using an example.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,640
The prime number q is 353, and

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,890
the alpha,
which is the primitive root of q, is 3.

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,660
User A selects a random number,
which is a secret to herself, and

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,550
this value is 97.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,030
So as you compute you, which is 3
raised to the power of 97 mod 353,

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,510
and the result is 40.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,689
User B selects a random number,
which is a secret to himself and

9
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,160
this value is 233.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,900
And you compute YB, which is 3 raised

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,880
to the power of 233 Mod 353,
and the result is 248.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:51,470
And they exchange these values,
that is user A sends 40 to user B.

13
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,450
And user B sends 248 to user A.

14
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:00,877
Then user A computes the following,
Y8 rates to the power of X8.

15
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:06,240
In this case, will be 248 Raise
to the power of 97 mod 353.

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,778
And the result is 160.

17
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:15,690
Likewise, User B] computes you
raised to the power of XB, mod q.

18
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:21,830
In this case, it is 40 raised
to the power 233 mod 353.

19
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,540
And the result is 160.

20
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:31,130
So as you can see, by exchanging you and
YB, both users A and

21
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:36,200
B compute the same secret value,
which is 160.

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,700
And this would become the shared
secret key between users A and B.

23
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,060
We assume that an attacker would be
able to obtain these publicly exchanged

24
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,750
values which encode in public keys, and

25
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,630
they also know the publicly
known numbers Q and alpha.

26
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,730
In this case, because the integers
involved are very small.

27
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,550
It is feasible that the attacker
will be able to figure out

28
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,150
the secret value Xa and
Xb, which is 97 and 333.

29
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:12,350
However if very large number is
involved, such as when the prime number

30
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,630
Q is at least 200 bits long,
then a task of finding Xa,

31
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:22,400
the secret value,
from 1a the public value is not feasible
