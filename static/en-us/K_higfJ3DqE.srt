1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,000
now we'll combine the data from all the
regions using the Union tool since all

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,539
the data streams are the same no
configuration is needed of the Union

3
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:09,559
tool

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:17,060
let's run the workflow and take a look
at the output looking at the output of

5
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:20,329
the Union tool we can see that we have
the control treatment pairs

6
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:24,679
however we need to add the store
attribute information from the store

7
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:29,780
information data to perform the analysis
so let's try to join two on the canvas

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,310
and join the output from the in tool
with the store information data stream

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:39,829
will join the treatment field from the
Union tool to the store field for the

10
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:44,780
store data and then we'll remove the
right store filled because we don't need

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,469
the store information twice so let's run
the workflow and see what our output

12
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:55,939
looks like now we now have a data set
that can be used to perform analysis a

13
00:00:55,939 --> 00:01:00,859
list of control and treatment pairs with
the region and associated test group so

14
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:04,759
let's drag an output two on the canvas
and save the data file for later use

15
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:09,108
we're now ready to perform analysis and
summarize the results of the test
