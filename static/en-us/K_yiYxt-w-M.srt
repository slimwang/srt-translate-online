1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,700
So what do we mean by
a linear dynamics model?

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,400
Well, it's pretty straight forward.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,461
A linear dynamics model says
that our state at time t will be

4
00:00:09,461 --> 00:00:14,630
distributed according to
a normal distribution whose mean

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,820
is just the linear function
of the previous belief, okay?

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,021
So D here is a it's either a scalar or
a matrix,

7
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:26,790
depending upon whether x is a scalar or
a vector.

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,460
And then we take that and
we put some Gaussian noise around it,

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,240
some covariance.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,820
And by the way, you'll notice this
little t here on these Ds, okay?

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,090
What that says is, it could be that
our dynamics model changes over time.

12
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,660
That is the actual multiplication
that we do, might change.

13
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,380
But we assume we know it.

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:55,070
So I'll tell you the vast majority of
Kalman filters, those Ds are constant.

15
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,530
So that the, the transformation and
this thing here,

16
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,420
which is referred to as
the process noise, is constant.

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,490
All that's absolutely required is
that it's known for every time t.

18
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,210
So that's the linear dynamics model.

19
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,550
We're going to do an example
of that in just a minute.

20
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,850
We also assume a linear
measurement model.

21
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,020
And that looks stunningly similar,
right?

22
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,480
What that says is that the measurement
we'll get will be some Gaussian

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,090
normal distribution that's
about some linear, m,

24
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,600
here is a measurement matrix,
that linearly multiplies the state.

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,390
And that the measurement noise.

26
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,070
Is also a Gaussian, and
again, it's subscripted by t,

27
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,640
because it could vary with time,
but we assume that it's not.

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,540
So, what I haven't mentioned is that
this x, both on this slide, and

29
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,210
on this slide, those x's are unknown.

30
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,280
We don't, remember,
it's the hidden state.

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,560
We don't actually know
what this state is.

32
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,360
What we're saying is that this is
how our linear dynamics model works.
