00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,810
Well, let's see and the answer is 8. So here what's happening. Python is looking for x and y.

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,530
It finds y inside the local scope of add_nums.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,870
It doesn't find x inside that local scope so it moves up

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,370
into the globe of variables and it finds x there.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,190
It makes use of it--6 + 2 is 8.
