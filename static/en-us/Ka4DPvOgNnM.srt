00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here's a geometric interpretation that may help you understand a little better what's going on.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Here we've gone back to the two-finger Morra game.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Now, remember we looked at the two possibilities of E going first

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and revealing a strategy of playing one with probability P and two with probability of 1 - P.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Now O has a choice of what to do, and O wants to minimize.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If O chooses one, he'll be somewhere along this line

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
corresponding to this strategy for different values of P.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This graph here is showing the utility to E for different values of P

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that P chose in P's strategy.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now since O can achieve the minimum

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
since O gets to chose the strategy of doing one or two,

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
O can be anywhere on this frontier.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It makes sense to E to push that up at high as possible since H is the maximizer.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
E will choose this point here, which turns out to be at P = 7/12.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The same argument going on this side.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Here O has gone first and chosen the strategy, q:one and (1 - q):two.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now E has a choice of what to do. E can either choose two and be along this line,

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
depending on what the value of q is,

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
or can chose one, which will be along this line.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It would make sense for O, who is trying to minimize,

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
to get this frontier down as low as possible.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
O would choose the value of q that puts us right here at this point.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It turns out that that also is q = 7/12.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We see that each side is trying to maximize or minimize,

25
00:01:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and we end up at a distinguished point that's the intersection of their two strategies.
