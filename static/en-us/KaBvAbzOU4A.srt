00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,609
In the last lesson, we looked at Motion Problems, by looking at the distance,

2
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:08,016
rate and times of different objects. We saw how fast some people could bike and

3
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:11,556
we saw how fast some things could travel. We're going to tackle a similar

4
00:00:11,556 --> 00:00:15,543
Motion Problem, this time it's going to involve a current. And in order to

5
00:00:15,543 --> 00:00:18,907
solve these problems involving current, we want to be clear on 2 words,

6
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:23,453
upstream and downstream. If we think about swimming laps inside of a pool, I

7
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:27,988
could say that my speed would be 5 miles per hour. That's about how fast I swim

8
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:32,350
from each side of the pool. 5 miles per hour would be considered to be my speed

9
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,539
in still water, since there's no current pushing me forward or backward. I'm

10
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:41,386
just swimming along inside of a pool. But what if instead I went swimming in a

11
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:45,642
river? A river has a current to it, so if i swim downstream I would be swimming

12
00:00:45,642 --> 00:00:50,880
with the current. And if I swim upstream i would be going again the current. If

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,158
the speed of the current is 3 miles per hour. And I know that in still water I

14
00:00:55,158 --> 00:00:58,398
can swim 5 miles per hour, what would be my speed if I was traveling

15
00:00:58,398 --> 00:01:04,772
downstream? And, what would be my speed if I traveled upstream? Write those 2

16
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:06,090
answers here.
