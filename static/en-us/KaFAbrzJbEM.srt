00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,105
The best and fastest way is to find a mathematical relationship between the

00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:08,320
number of days that have passed and the total number of wipers said that I've

3
00:00:08,332 --> 00:00:12,150
been made. Completing the table would work, but it would be pretty time

4
00:00:12,162 --> 00:00:16,485
consuming. Estimating is often a good way to begin thinking about a problem, but

5
00:00:16,497 --> 00:00:20,483
it doesn't give exact answers. We want to get information to Grant quickly but

6
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:00,000
we also want to be really accurate about. it.
