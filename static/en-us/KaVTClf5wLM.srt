00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The variance is a measure of how far the data is spread.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's really small if the data is centered around the mean,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and it's really large if the data falls far away from the mean.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Here are two trees, and both of these trees have a couple of apples

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Of course, the apples at some point fall down.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
When they're on the ground, then all of them are centered equally around the stem of the tree,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
so if you computed the mean you would get back exactly where the stem of the tree is.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But on the wide tree, the spread is much larger,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
whereas for the small tree, the spread is much smaller.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You can think of variance as a measure of how wide the tree is from which the apples fell down.
