1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,680
Now that we have the menu XML, add the code in

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,590
the fragment to inflate it. You can leave a placeholder for

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,020
when the Refresh button is selected. This is what it should

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,740
look when you're done. You should see the Refresh menu item there,

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,730
but tapping on it doesn't do anything. That's fine for now.

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,600
If needed, you can look at mainactivity.java for reference. If you get

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,570
stuck and don't see the menu item appear, try to answer

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,630
this question first: what fragment method do you need to call in

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,430
order to report that it has menu options to display?
