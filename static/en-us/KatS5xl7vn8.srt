00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
[Thrun] Now let's flip the coin 4 times, and let's call Xi the result of the i-th coin flip.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So each Xi is going to be drawn from heads or tail.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What's the probability that all 4 of those flips give us the same result,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
no matter what it is, assuming that each one of those has identically

5
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
an equally distributed probability of coming up heads of the half?
