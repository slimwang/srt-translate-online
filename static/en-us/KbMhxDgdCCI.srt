00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,719
In the last lesson, you saw how
Xcode can automatically create

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,770
a view controller and
wire it up for you.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,070
You even added a code to
this view controller.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,878
At this point you might be wondering
what is a view controller and

5
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:15,430
how do I know what methods
to override in it?

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,830
As we're going to see,
the documentation will be our guide.

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,730
The view controller is a special kind of
class that, as the name implies,

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,990
controls a view and handles all of
the actions required by that view.

9
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:27,950
In iOS development,

10
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,009
this means that this class is usually
a subclass of UIViewController.

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,750
Inherited from the UIkit framework.

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,780
The view controller is called by a OS
when certain events happen to it or

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,620
your app overall.

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,500
In the beginning, your app is not
running as soon as the icon is pressed

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,855
in moves through the inactive state and
immediately into the active state.

16
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:52,735
When an event happens,
maybe a phone call or

17
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:54,705
the user decides to go to another app,

18
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:58,972
your app will transition to the inactive
state and then to the background.

19
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:00,382
From the background state,

20
00:01:00,382 --> 00:01:03,152
after a few seconds it will
go to the suspended state.

21
00:01:04,282 --> 00:01:06,942
What happens when the user
wants to go back to your app?

22
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,092
If your app is in the background,

23
00:01:08,092 --> 00:01:11,780
it will go through the inactive
state to being active.

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,620
Last but not least,
if iOS needs more memory and

25
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,900
your app is in suspended state and
may be moved off memory entirely,

26
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,420
and we're back to the beginning of
this diagram to the not running state.

27
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,360
How do I know or functions UIV
controllers has that I should override?

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,120
How do I know which
functions get called and

29
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,190
then the what events
in this state diagram?

30
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,220
It's all in the documentation and it's
always the first place you should look.

31
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,450
Now, it's a good time to learn how
to open up documentation in Xcode.

32
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,120
Let's open up the ViewController.swift
file, and navigate to the top.

33
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,230
Here, you can see the line this
shows that the ViewController

34
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:50,220
class inherits from UIViewController.

35
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,970
If you hold down the option key,

36
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,000
you can see that the cursor changes to
a question mark when we go over a class.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,330
In this example, UIViewController.

38
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,990
If we click once,
we can see a contextual manual come up

39
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,807
showing us all the information
about the UIViewController class.

40
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,210
Clicking anywhere else
dismisses this contextual menu.

41
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,730
If you click anywhere you can
dismiss the documentation pop up.

42
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,030
Another way to see the full
documentation is to hold down the option

43
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,457
key but this time double click
on the UIViewController class.

44
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,580
This will show you the documentation
window and open it in full screen.

45
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,000
Showing us UIViewController.

46
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,410
Another way to view the documentation
window is to go under help and

47
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,330
choose documentation and API reference.

48
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,260
You can also get this window to come up
by using the key combination Shift+Cmd+0

49
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,080
anywhere within Xcode.

50
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,680
Take a moment now to look for

51
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,000
viewDidLoad under the UI view
controller documentation.
