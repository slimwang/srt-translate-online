1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,930
Sometimes it's really obvious that code
has a bug because the bug makes the code

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,010
crash.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,260
And when it crashes it usually
gives some kind of error message.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,200
Error messages can be confusing, but
they do give some kind of information

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,310
besides just, it didn't work,
try something different.

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,210
Specifically, when Python code crashes,

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,400
the message it gives
is called a Traceback.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,420
The Traceback tells you what line it
crashed on, what file it was running,

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,680
and how it got there.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,960
The information the Traceback gives you,
especially the line number and

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,170
function name,

12
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,720
can focus your attention on the part
of the code that might be going wrong.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,700
Even if the root of that problem
isn't on that exact line,

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,670
it's somewhere upstream of that line.

15
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,640
In this case, line number 5 is
doing something that doesn't work,

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,950
trying to add a number and a string.

17
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,930
And we can look up the error message
to find out what to do about it.

18
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,321
In this case, if we look up
unsupported operand type(s) for

19
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:57,550
+: int, str, how about you try it.

20
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,280
Look this error message up on
your favorite search engine, and

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,550
see if you can find a solution.
