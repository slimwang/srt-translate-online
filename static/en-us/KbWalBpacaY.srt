1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,000
Now where is Larry, our octopus?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,110
How do our model and our view connect to each other?

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,800
Well, let's think about what things happen in our app and

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,400
maybe we can sort this out.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,370
So, first of all, the app loads up.

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,300
We start with a blank screen.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,940
First the list gets created, then the list view populates with cats.

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,160
Larry the octopus does both of these things.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,620
Now, not for rendering it on the screen, that's the job of this particular view.

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,140
But our octopus is what tells this view to render itself in the first place.

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,960
In other words, the octopus gets things going.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,770
Then the octopus changes the current cat in our model.

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,150
Current cat gets set to this first cat.

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,080
When that happens, the octopus says, hey, go ahead and

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,040
render this view here and then the current cat view gets rendered.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,050
Now again, the rendering of this view here is not the responsibility of Larry.

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,230
But Larry the Octopus does tell that view when to render.

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,350
So now the octopus has gotten our model started, gotten our views started and

19
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,110
everything has gotten rendered.

20
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,980
Now let's talk about the case where the user has clicked on a cat.

21
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,950
Well, the octopus is keeping track of where you click.

22
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,830
So if you click on this cat here, the octopus will run

23
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,690
a method with increases this counter, first, in the model, and then in the view.

24
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:24,430
Now if a user clicks on a cat up here, let's say on this second one here,

25
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,880
then the octopus does the following thing, first it changes the model.

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,720
The current cat is now being set to Purr and

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,500
then it tells the view over here, to re-render itself.

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,700
So to recount, when the app loads up, first Larry initializes the model.

29
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,100
Now in this case, we just have simple data so that doesn't mean very much.

30
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,100
Then Larry tells all of the views to render themselves.

31
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,630
Then finally out octopus says whenever you click on any of these things,

32
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,500
do this particular or that particular piece of functionality.

33
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,280
And then tell the respective views that have changed to rerender themselves
