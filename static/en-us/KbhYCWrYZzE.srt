1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,610
The first question, the best-case running time for a given input size is no longer

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,970
than the best measured time for each algorithm.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:14,830
This is true and to think about this, all you really need to do is realize that our definition--

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,240
the best-case running time is better than all other possible running time.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,480
If there's one smaller than it, well, it's not really the best is it, and you can think

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,730
of the same thing for the worst-case running time to the second one, which is also true.

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,910
The worst-case running time for given input size is at least the worst measured time for each algorithm

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,110
because if there is a worst or longer measured time, then the worst-case running time--

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,260
well then it's not worst is it.

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,930
Now, for the third question, algorithm beta is the fastest for all inputs.

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:51,570
This is actually false, and even though it's actually true for all of the inputs that we tested,

12
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,540
it might not be true for much smaller inputs--for example, n=1 or 2.

13
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:04,129
We can't say that it's the fastest for all inputs because well we haven't tested it on all inputs.

14
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,580
It might very well be the case but in order to say that we'll actually

15
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,860
need to test it and that's not really feasible.

16
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,400
And for the final question, what else can for smaller inputs the algorithm with exponential behavior

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,640
is faster than the algorithm with polynomial behavior, and this is actually true.

18
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,700
If you got alpha and gamma, alpha being the exponential algorithm and gamma being

19
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:33,170
the polynomial one, actually is faster--25 minutes is quite a bit faster than 500.

20
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,450
So this is actually true and it's interesting to see that sometimes for small inputs

21
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,740
and exponential algorithm isn't really that big of a deal.
