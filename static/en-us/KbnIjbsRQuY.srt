1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,650
So far, we've worked with the numerator being 1. We have only had one piece out

2
00:00:03,662 --> 00:00:07,175
of five. Let's see what else we can do. Here's a square again, and I'm going to

3
00:00:07,187 --> 00:00:10,775
split it up into four parts. Now, instead of having one piece, I'm going to have

4
00:00:10,787 --> 00:00:14,125
three. So now the area of this shaded square is 3 4ths. My numerator is 3,

5
00:00:14,212 --> 00:00:17,650
because I have three pieces. My denominator is 4, because I've split up my

6
00:00:17,662 --> 00:00:21,218
square into four equal pieces. Here's another square, and this time, I'm going

7
00:00:21,218 --> 00:00:25,605
to have all the pieces. Let's see what that looks like. So, now I have 4 out of

8
00:00:25,617 --> 00:00:29,705
4. When I have 4 divided by 4, that's really 1. Now that we've seen that the

9
00:00:29,717 --> 00:00:33,970
numerator doesn't have to be 1, let's try an example where it's not. We'll try

10
00:00:33,982 --> 00:00:35,055
this out with a quiz.
