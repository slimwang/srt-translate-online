00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here is an MDP question.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We have a deterministic environment, which means the state transitions are deterministic.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There is no probablistic or stochastic outcome of actions.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The cost of motion is -5. The terminal state is worth 100 as indicated.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We have four actions: north, south, west, and east.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The shaded state can't be entered.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please fill in the final values after value iteration converges.
