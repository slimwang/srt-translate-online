1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,400
In order for f of x equals a to the x, to exhibit exponential decay. A must lie

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,925
between 0 and 1, not including either of these numbers. When a is in this

3
00:00:10,925 --> 00:00:14,955
interval, the value of the function is multiplied by a fraction each time x

4
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:21,881
increases. Making f of x get smaller and smaller. Let's experiment with this

5
00:00:21,881 --> 00:00:25,587
for a second. Here we are, back in friendly old Desmos, and I've typed in the

6
00:00:25,587 --> 00:00:30,836
general function that we've been talking about, f of x equals a to the x. I've

7
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:37,130
made a into a number that I can adjust by sliding this right here. Right now, a

8
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,718
is set to 1 and, as we calculated before, this is just a horizontal line, f of

9
00:00:41,718 --> 00:00:47,610
x equals 1. Now, let's see what happens as I decrease a. You can see right

10
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,315
away, just when I let it go below 1, we already have a function showing

11
00:00:51,315 --> 00:00:56,894
exponential decay. As I continue to make it smaller, the decay gets more and

12
00:00:56,894 --> 00:01:00,930
more steep. It's happening more quickly. That's going to continue to happen

13
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,590
until a gets too small. When a reaches 0, we have that constant function again.

14
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,504
Except, this time, it's at f of x equals 0. We can, of course, also slide over

15
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:14,415
into the exponential growth area as well. That would just mean we need to

16
00:01:14,415 --> 00:01:20,010
increase a past 1. Let's try that. Here were are back in our exponential decay.

17
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:26,096
And there we go, we're growing. Just above 1 we already see that new pattern

18
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:31,380
forming. And the growth gets steeper and steeper as a increases. Since we're

19
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,375
going to be multiplying by more and more each time x increases. If I let a get

20
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:41,634
really big, our graph's going to increase at incredibly quick rate. I would

21
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,548
encourage you to visit the Desmos website and play around with this on your

22
00:01:44,548 --> 00:01:47,858
own. It's really fun to see how many different things you can do with

23
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,459
exponential functions.
