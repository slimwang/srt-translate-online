00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,820
So far, we've been talking about taking
over part of the user's home screen

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,750
with widgets.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,970
Meaning that they trade their
precious home screen space for

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,742
more information from Sunshine.

5
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:12,280
A useful trade off for me, and maybe for

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,350
many others but there's another element
on the home screen we haven't looked at,

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,580
the background of the home screen,
called the wallpaper.

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,430
Could we use the wallpaper as a passive
way to bring weather information

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,730
to the user?

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,580
Yes, we can.

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,350
Now, the type of information
we can provide for

12
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,940
wallpaper is somewhat
different from a widget.

13
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,380
Colored icons and text don't exactly
scream most beautiful background ever to

14
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,815
me but what we can do is make beautiful
backgrounds into the weather.

15
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:46,960
A sunny picture for a sunny day,
a snowy picture for wintertime fun,

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,356
and some ominous rain clouds for
when an umbrella's a good idea.

17
00:00:50,356 --> 00:00:54,460
Sounds neat but
how would you actually do it?

18
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,410
What about pictures that are too bright,
making the text or icons hard to read?

19
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,480
How can we build something like
this without becoming an expert

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,060
on dynamically changing wallpapers?

21
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,670
Sometimes, you do have
to become an expert but

22
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,470
just as many times, some good Google
fu might reveal the perfect library or

23
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,710
the perfect app that makes
your job much, much easier.

24
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,880
It just so happens,
this is one of those cases.

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,560
There's already a live wallpaper
app out there called Muzei

26
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,640
that provides an extensible
system Sunshine can plug into

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,110
to build our dynamic weather wallpapers.

28
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,120
So how does that even work?
