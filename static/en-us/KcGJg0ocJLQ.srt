1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,470
So, as long as my frequencies are low enough, I'm okay.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,570
But what if they're not low enough, what happens?

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,330
Well now, let's suppose I have higher frequency thing, so

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,998
this is some random function, and it has some high frequency.

5
00:00:12,998 --> 00:00:18,250
So, here is its f of u, and you see its w goes out a little bit further.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,010
If now, I multiply that by the same comb of M, I'm going to convolve this thing

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,590
with that 1 over M comb that I had before, and I'm going to get this part here.

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,650
Now remember, these things actually sum.

9
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,200
I'm drawing each individual component, but

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,430
in reality, this thing would sum and come back up here, all right?

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,411
So, these things would sum and come back up there.

12
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:48,169
And this area right here is where this is, essentially, this energy has

13
00:00:48,169 --> 00:00:53,320
folded back on itself, it's overlapped and then they're going to add, okay?

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,225
That high frequency that was really this little edge thing here, okay?

15
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:03,070
Or, it's the thing that's there, is pretending it's low frequency.

16
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,110
That's the aliasing.

17
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,642
And once you've aliased the signal,

18
00:01:07,642 --> 00:01:11,372
once you've done this operation, you cannot undo it.

19
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:15,618
The high frequencies have pretended that they're low frequencies, and

20
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:18,913
you can't separate them out from real low frequencies.

21
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:22,375
You have to remove the high frequencies before you do the sampling,

22
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,085
in order to remove the aliasing.

23
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,540
So, how might you do that?

24
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,480
Okay.

25
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,157
Well, how do you remove high frequencies?

26
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,492
Well, we know how to do that.

27
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:32,326
We convolve with h.

28
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:33,527
Maybe its another Gaussian.

29
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,528
What does that do?

30
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:37,064
That reduces the high frequencies.

31
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:40,801
So the, the frequency spectrum of the convolution of f and h.

32
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,370
It has much less high frequency.

33
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:48,824
So, that h is what's referred to as an anti-aliasing filter, and

34
00:01:48,824 --> 00:01:55,710
it has the net effect of trimming the high frequencies of the original signal.

35
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:01,440
So that then, when I do the multiplication by the comb, which is shown here,

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,830
right, I'm now convolving that with a comb filter in the frequency domain.

37
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,788
But, I don't get that overlap, right?

38
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:14,260
So no aliasing goes on, all right?

39
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,590
And then to recover the signal, whatever I get after I

40
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,940
reconstruct from that using the new sampled, convolved function,

41
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,210
I can throw away any high frequencies because those are not real.

42
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,751
As we, so just the way we did with the, the CD right?

43
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,420
We, we low pass filtered the microphone.

44
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,400
Did a A to D conversion to get some digital samples.

45
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,830
We did a D to A conversion to get an analog.

46
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,160
And we knew that any high frequency that showed up, that's not real.

47
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,940
Okay, we could low pass that away and recover the original signal.

48
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,720
So, that's summarized here in terms of aliasing.

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,950
When I don't have an anti-aliasing filter, I get these overlap regions

50
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,070
that cause me to get aliasings that I cannot remove once I've done it.

51
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:05,280
But, with an anti-aliasing filter, I don't get that overlap.

52
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,580
So, that's the mathematics behind aliasing.
