00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,985
Memory is sometimes taken for granted. But it's importance cannot be

2
00:00:03,985 --> 00:00:08,663
overstated. Memory allows us to interact successfully in our world. Through

3
00:00:08,663 --> 00:00:12,439
case studies such as HM, we can gain a better understanding of the areas of the

4
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:18,366
brain involved in memory. We have three types of memory. Sensory memory, which

5
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:22,654
includes iconic and echoic memory, short-term or working memory and long-term

6
00:00:22,654 --> 00:00:28,605
memory. Sensory memory is very short in duration. Working memory allows for the

7
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:31,905
day to day fluidity of our actions, and long-term memory is comprised of

8
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:37,255
several types of memory. Long-term memory includes declarative memory, which

9
00:00:37,255 --> 00:00:43,090
consists of episodic memory or memory for personal events. And semantic memory

10
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,530
which is memory for facts. In addition, we also have explicit and implicit

11
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:53,174
memories. The four steps in long term memory formation are encoding,

12
00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:58,868
consolidation, storage and retrevial. We can use schemas, associative networks,

13
00:00:58,868 --> 00:01:04,156
and mnemonic devices in aiding our memory efforts. Over time, we may experience

14
00:01:04,156 --> 00:01:08,806
forgetting and memory loss. In addition, illness and injury can also impair our

15
00:01:08,806 --> 00:01:13,410
memory. This can result from things such as Alzheimer's disease or dementia and

16
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,160
accidents that may result in amnesia. Some important areas of the brain

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,240
involved in memory include the cerebellum and striatum, the hippocampus and the

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,874
amygdala. Furthermore, the prefrontal cortex. Auditory cortex, visual cortex,

19
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:32,690
and somatosensory cortex all play a role in memory.
