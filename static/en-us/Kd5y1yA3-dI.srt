1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,019
We have discussed that in
the encryption key should be a secret.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,470
What about the encryption
algorithm itself?

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,220
In general,
we should keep the algorithm open so

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,460
that it can be revealed and
improved by the broader community.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,680
More importantly,

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,320
we don't have to rely on the secrecy
of the algorithm for security.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,800
In other words, we don't have
to use obscurity for security.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,350
Therefore, in practice we should
always use the widely known and

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,670
deployed algorithms and standards.
