00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,900
You might be wondering how we're going to save the awesome images that we're

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,630
creating inside the canvas.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's go ahead and do that right now.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,020
I'v opened up the HTML document that we've been building,

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,420
with this script inside that we're using to control the canvas.

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,700
And I've added these two lines here.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,240
In this one, I've created a new variable called saved image, and

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,338
I've used this new method, toDataURL.

9
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:24,100
I'm calling toDataURL on c, which,

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,135
as you may recall, is the canvas object that we grabbed earlier.

11
00:00:28,135 --> 00:00:31,540
toDataURL, creates a text string that represents the photo.

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,830
It can output a couple different image formats, but

13
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,500
we're only going to use the default for now.

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,250
So I've created this new text string representing the image.

15
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,600
And now I'll call window.open on the new save savedimage that we just created.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,820
This should open the new image in a different window.

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,550
Let's go ahead, and see if it works.

18
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:53,210
I will save this and come over to the browser, and refresh, and OK.

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,425
It doesn't look like a new window is opening.

20
00:00:56,425 --> 00:00:57,660
Okay, that's kind of weird.

21
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,058
Let's see if we can figure out what's going on here.

22
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:00,578
Uh-huh.

23
00:01:00,578 --> 00:01:01,760
Okay.

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,370
So we're getting an error, which says that tainted canvases may not be exported.

25
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,740
This is an interesting problem.

26
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,330
There are a number of different ways to get around it but basically what it's

27
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,800
saying is that we need to figure out a way of safely hosting and

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,960
serving these images in order to save them.

29
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,180
Depending on your browser, you've got a few different options for

30
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,350
getting around it.

31
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,400
First off in Chrome you can actually just simply right click and hit Save image

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,280
as on whatever you want to save it, which is a really easy way of saving images.

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,310
Or you can take an even simpler out which is to simply take a screenshot, and

34
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,020
save your image that way.

35
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,920
But that isn't necessarily what we're going for here.

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,280
If you want to actually be able to export these and

37
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,360
to save them later without right-clicking on them you actually have to

38
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,150
create your own server, running probably on your local machine or online.

39
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,580
And the steps to do so are definitely outside the scope of this course, but

40
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,710
you can check out some of the links in the instructor notes for

41
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,200
more details on how to do that yourself.

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,245
But for now if you want to save an image using chrome you can just simply

43
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:07,020
right-click on the image and that should work, or you can take a screenshot or,

44
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,620
you know, if you're feeling ambitious check out the instructor notes to

45
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,980
