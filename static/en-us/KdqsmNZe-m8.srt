00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,100
Take a look at this simple exercise. The solution is somewhat straightfoward.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,220
The bind function will take the key value that we're given and map it to an

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,724
action string that we define before. The on-key down event will then need to do

4
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:15,215
something a little bit different too. It will actually have to look up the

5
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:18,680
action value given the key code through the binding system and then mark the

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,819
action as true. If the code hasn't actually defined the action, which is

7
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:28,228
possible, this block of code won't be executed. Thus saving you from any sort

8
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:31,236
of weird out-of-bounds errors or code being executed that doesn't actually

9
00:00:31,236 --> 00:00:32,320
exist.
