1
00:00:00,325 --> 00:00:04,800
But the DMCA does allow some exclusions.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,220
So, there are exclusions for
research and educational purposes.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,645
So, if you're doing research in sort of
understanding how strong, secure some

4
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:18,830
anti-piracy techniques are, hopefully
you're not doing anything illegal.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,290
Similarly, as I said,
libraries can make some

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,050
limited number of copies and
that's not viewed as illegal either.

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,920
So that's one of the exclusions.

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,379
However, I should say that,
one of the criticisms people have for

9
00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:36,812
these laws is that they're
kind of vague and broad.

10
00:00:36,812 --> 00:00:40,982
And people sort of have different
interpretations of those depending on

11
00:00:40,982 --> 00:00:41,812
who they are.

12
00:00:41,812 --> 00:00:45,892
So although we sort of say there
are exclusions, of course,

13
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:50,854
how far those exclusions go, there
have been disagreements about that.

14
00:00:50,854 --> 00:00:57,610
So RIAA, which is the Recording
Industry Association of America,

15
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:03,910
they'll actually file lawsuits
against P2P sharing music.

16
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:09,270
So these are on one side, the
Electronic Frontier Foundation or EFF,

17
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,270
sort of what is about a too
broad a scope of these laws and

18
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,610
potential abuse of the laws themselves
