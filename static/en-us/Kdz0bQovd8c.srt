1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,870
So here's an example that we're going to
use to kind of motivate this idea.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,510
So here's a representation of a POMDP.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,600
It's got how many states?

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,500
>> Four.
>> Good.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,420
It's got how many observations?

6
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:10,920
Three!

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,360
Right, blue, green, and red.

8
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,490
And so these two states
are indistinguishable by their

9
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,630
immediate observations.

10
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,130
And let's say there's four actions,
north, south, east, west.

11
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,314
So north from this red
takes you to this green,

12
00:00:20,314 --> 00:00:22,710
north from this red
takes you to this blue.

13
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,900
East and west from this blue
leave you where you were, etc.

14
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,750
Does that make some sense?

15
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,490
>> Yes.

16
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,190
>> So we've got left, right, up, down as
our actions and these four states and

17
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,800
these three possible observations.

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,620
And so we can represent this as a POMDP.

19
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,290
If we know these dynamics,
we know this system, we know this model,

20
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,930
we can represent what's the probability
we're in each of these states, one, two,

21
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:44,830
three, four, the states.

22
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:50,080
And so for example, if I say okay, I'm
going to start off uniformly at random.

23
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,010
And by the way,
the state you're in is currently red.

24
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,640
So then our belief state would be
what zero, zero, a half, a half.

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,460
If we then go left, then our
belief state would be zero, zero,

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,355
a half, a half still.

27
00:01:00,355 --> 00:01:01,110
>> Right.

28
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,300
>> If we went up and observed green,

29
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,010
then our probability distribution
would be zero, one, zero, zero.

30
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,440
We'd definitely be in this state.

31
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,220
And actually, given that there's
no stochasticity in this case,

32
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,840
we would know where we were
forever after, right, and

33
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,870
we would continue to act and
we'll know where we are.

34
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:20,130
We're going to to try to re-represent
the same idea, the same system, the same

35
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,950
model, but not using a POMDP but
instead by using a set of predictions.

36
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,770
So I'm going to claim that the tests
that we're going to use for

37
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,160
this representation, well,
there's lots of possibilities, but

38
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,160
we're going to do is say, hey,
what would happen if you were to go up?

39
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,260
Would you see blue?

40
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,510
So what's the probability that
you'd see blue after going up?

41
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,090
And if you were to go left,
would you see red?

42
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,910
What's the probability of
seeing red if we were to go

43
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,750
left from the current state?

44
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,666
And so again,
the state is going to be predictions.

45
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,243
It's going to be probabilities
on these two quantities, and

46
00:01:51,243 --> 00:01:52,958
we're going to try to keep that updated.

47
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,910
We're going to keep these
predictions updated as we move

48
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,200
around in the environment.

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,470
>> Okay, so we're replacing
a distribution over states with

50
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:07,630
a kind of distribution over the outcomes
of tests that we might take.

51
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,180
>> Yeah, I think that's
a good way to think about it.

52
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,890
Probabilities that we get here
don't necessarily have to add up to

53
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,500
one, right?

54
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,840
That's sort of independent,

55
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,160
the question of how likely is
it to see blue when we go up?

56
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,810
How likely is it to see
red after we go left?

57
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,960
But other than that,
it is a sort of probabilistic quantity.

58
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,188
But we kind of like this notion that
these tests are actions and observations

59
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:32,281
because in any given time, we could say,
hey, this seems like the kind of

60
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:36,205
situation where it's two-thirds
probable that I go up and see blue.

61
00:02:36,205 --> 00:02:38,210
Let's just try that just to make sure.

62
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,790
So we can go up, see whether or
not we see blue, and

63
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,280
see how often that
actually seems to happen.

64
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,200
It's still not trivial
to learn in this case,

65
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,810
but at least it's grounded out in
observables, actions, and observations.

66
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,390
>> Right, and I guess sort of
philosophically, if I might

67
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,930
wax philosophical for a moment, there's
really no difference between this and

68
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,840
states, right, because states
are kind of made up things,

69
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,100
which represent states of the world,
dare I say it.

70
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,170
Then these tests also kind of represent,
at least implicitly,

71
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,136
other states of the world and are just
as fine a reasonable representation

72
00:03:10,136 --> 00:03:12,150
as these made up nominal circles.

73
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,410
>> Yeah,
they're not certainly no worse, but

74
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,600
I'm going to argue that in principle,
they might even be better.

75
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,410
Because again,
you can actually execute these tests and

76
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,720
see what the outcomes were.

77
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,440
>> And then that will tell you where
you were and possibly where you are.

78
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,300
>> Yeah, or at least would let you
validate your current predictions.

79
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,010
Whereas with states, if I think,
okay, I'm in the belief state zero,

80
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,280
a half, a half to zero,
there's nothing that you can validate.

81
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,470
There's no test that you can run.

82
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,310
There's no experiment you can do
in the world that would tell you

83
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,420
what the states actually were
because states are not observable.

84
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,730
>> But these tests can tell
you sort of whether you are,

85
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,295
I'm going to try to ground
this out an example.

86
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:51,550
So, am I sick,
do I have a particular disease?

87
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,880
Well, there are tests that I
could run that would tell me, and

88
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,230
then I might be able to do
other more interesting things.

89
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:02,020
And that's kind of a practical thing to
know, rather than asking the question, I

90
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,040
mean, it's one way of sort of answering
an underlying question of am I in

91
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,245
the state of being sick or in the state
of, I don't know, having blue hay fever.

92
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:12,195
>> [LAUGH] I guess that's
this upper left state.

93
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:15,780
>> Yeah, so I'm intrigued,
so what's next?

94
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,170
What do we do with these tests?

95
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:22,850
>> Well, so in principle, we should
be able to learn PSR representations.

96
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,790
And because again, if we have a test,
we should be able to validate it and

97
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,880
make our predictions better over time.

98
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,438
And in principle, we could plan
in this kind of space as well.

99
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,460
We're not going to talk about
either of those in the class, but

100
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,460
I do want to do a slightly more concrete
example of these test probabilities with

101
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,170
this little grid that we've got going
here, just to make it more concrete.

102
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,670
>> Okay.
