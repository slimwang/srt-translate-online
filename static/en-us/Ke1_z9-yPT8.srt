1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,790
All right. Now for a little fun exercise.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,700
If data that we needed to store

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,320
included images or other binary data,

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,500
how would we store it?

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,900
Would we put the raw data
in the database?

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,470
Would we store files
into a public folder on the device?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,690
Or would we store the files
in a private folder

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,790
and reference the location
in the database?
