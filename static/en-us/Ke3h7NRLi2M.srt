00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,170
Just like you right hand and left hands, both have 5 fingers but look different,

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,456
coordinate systems also have an orientation to them. We need to find a set of

3
00:00:08,456 --> 00:00:12,062
axes. You also need to specify one other fact, whether the axes are in

4
00:00:12,062 --> 00:00:16,100
right-handed or in left-handed system. Here's an example of a right-handed

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,763
coordinate system. Say, I want to build a building. I define the x-axis as going

6
00:00:20,763 --> 00:00:25,902
east and the y-axis as going north. Now, my floor plan shows x pointing right, y

7
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:29,882
pointing up. This is the standard 2D Cartesian coordinate system. If I had to

8
00:00:29,882 --> 00:00:34,106
find altitude as the z-axis with the arrow coming out of the diagram towards the

9
00:00:34,106 --> 00:00:38,410
viewer, this is a right-handed coordinate system. Why is this right-handed?

10
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,883
Well, if you place your thumb along the x-axis and the index finger along the

11
00:00:42,883 --> 00:00:47,500
y-axis, the middle finger is the z-axis and points towards you. You'll notice if

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,965
you try to do the same thing with your left hand, you can't match up all 3 axes,

13
00:00:50,965 --> 00:00:55,230
at least not comfortably. This is a left-handed coordinate system. The key thing

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,584
to realize is that the left-handed coordinate system is equally valid. It does

15
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:02,444
not change the underlying reality of, of the situation. For example, intelligent

16
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:06,940
rabbits might agree that x is east and y is north, that's fine. However, they

17
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,704
might decide that the z-axis points down into the page. The rabbits care more

18
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:15,184
about how far down a tunnel is dug from ground level and want to say 5 feet,

19
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:18,716
instead of negative 5 feet when they're digging. This is a left-handed

20
00:01:18,716 --> 00:01:22,672
coordinate system. The underlying reality is the same in both cases, nothing has

21
00:01:22,672 --> 00:01:26,948
changed place, just how we and the rabbits refer to location differs. When we

22
00:01:26,948 --> 00:01:30,672
say 12 meters, the rabbits would say, negative 12 meters and vice-versa. To

23
00:01:30,672 --> 00:01:34,759
convert between these particular two systems is simply a matter of negating the

24
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,933
z-coordinate value.
