1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So the answer here is 1 or true,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and you can see that as follows:

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So X1 is equal to 1, not X2 is equal to 0,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
so 1 or 0 is equal to 1,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so this whole part here is equal to 1,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and actually X3 is also equal to 1.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So we have that this whole part here is equal to 1,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
X3 is equal to 1, and 1 or 1 is 1 again,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
so this whole part here is equal to 1.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And over here we have not X1, which is 0 or X2,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but X2 is true or 1,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and so the whole thing 0 or 1 is equal to 1,

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and so we have 1 and 1,

14
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which evaluates to 1.
