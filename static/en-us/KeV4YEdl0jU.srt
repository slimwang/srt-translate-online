00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,150
Encryption schemes and attacks on
encryption schemes have been around for

00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,460
thousands of years.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,660
The main attack approaches
are brute force and cryptanalysis.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,160
One other use of cryptography
includes some combination of hash,

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,530
secret key cryptography, and
public key cryptography.
