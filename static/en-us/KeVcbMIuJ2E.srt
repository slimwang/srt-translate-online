1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,180
The Medicare and
Medicaid Incentive Payments

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,030
are based on achieving the stages
of Meaningful Use, shown here.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,630
The amount providers can earn is tied

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,080
to the number of Medicare
patients in their practice.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,780
For the Medicaid program, 30% of
a practice is necessary to qualify,

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,420
except for pediatricians
where the threshold is 20%.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,610
The details for
Medicare are shown here, and

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,280
you can review them
if you're interested.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,420
Basically the earlier provider starts,
the more they can earn.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,710
Not shown here are the reductions
in Medicare Payments for

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,860
providers that haven't achieved
meaningful use by 2015.

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,410
But there are no penalties
under the Medicaid program.

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,550
Why do you think there are no
penalties under the Medicaid Incentive

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,019
payments program?
