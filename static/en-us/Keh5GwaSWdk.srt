1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,270
We've learned even more about the relationship between age

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,620
and friend count by making use of the variables' gender

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,970
and tenure. We've seen that users who have been

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,270
on the site longer, typically have higher friend counts across

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,650
ages. Now, this leaves me wondering if friend requests

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,820
are the same or different across groups. Do new users

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,520
go on friending sprees? Or do users with more

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,248
tenure initiate more friendships? Let's explore this with a plot.

9
00:00:25,248 --> 00:00:26,781
I want you to create a line

10
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:30,406
graph of friendships initiated per day, versus tenure.

11
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:32,506
You need to make use of the variables

12
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:37,270
age, tenure, friendships initiated, and year_joined.bucket. The color

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,126
of each part of your one line should

14
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:42,410
correspond to each bucket of year_joined. You'll also

15
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,220
need to subset the data to only consider users with at least one day of tenure.
