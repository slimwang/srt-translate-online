00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,380
Now an application, such as Google Earth, sits at

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,230
the top of the hierarchy. And it's code for

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,910
tracking the mouse movement on the screen, written in

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,380
whatever high level language is compiled into the instruction

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,530
set and traverses the rest of the hierarchy and

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,940
magic happens on the screen. Now within this hierarchy,

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,870
the operating system acts as a broker between the

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,700
application at the top. And the physical resources such

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,950
as CPU, memory, and IO devices, can provide an app,

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,730
with all it needs, for its successful and safe execution.
