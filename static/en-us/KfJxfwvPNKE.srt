00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,870
lets try another division problem. We are going to divide this rational

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,290
expression by this rational expression. Remember to change your division to

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,488
multiplication and then multiply by the reciprocal of the second fraction. Then

4
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:15,494
your problem turns into something that you've definitely seen before. You can
