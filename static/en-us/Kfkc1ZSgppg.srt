Andrew Goldberg described a data structure that can be used

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to very rapidly compute shortest-path distances between nodes in a network.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The way that it worked was each node of the network has a label.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What a label is is a list of other nodes in a network that he called hubs

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
along with the distance to that hub.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The hubs are chosen for each node,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
the labels are chosen for each node,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
so that they have the property that for any two nodes in the network,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
any two nodes where you want to compute a shortest-path length between them,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
will have some hub in common in their labels that is on the shortest path

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
between those nodes.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let's make sure that you have a feel for this idea,

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and let's look at a particular kind of network--a star network--

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
where there is one node in the middle and all these other nodes directly connected to it.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How many hubs do we need to list in the labels of each of the nodes in a star network

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
so that we can make sure that we satisfy this property

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that we can compute the shortest path length sufficiently,

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
specifically because for any pair of nodes in the network

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
their labels will have some hub in common.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Why don't you type the number into the box.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You can use this particular star network as your example

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and give the answer for this star network,

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
but it turns out it actually works for star networks of any size.
