1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,670
In this unit I'm going to introduce you to 3 computer problems

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,670
that will actually turn out to be quite challenging.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,910
And I'm going to do this by introducing you to 3 computer scientists, Alice, Bob, and Carol.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:16,820
All 3 haven't yet had the chance to learn theoretical computer science or about challenging problems.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,600
Maybe they just didn't have the time or didn't think it was useful to them.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,460
But they're all pretty good practical computer scientists.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,360
So they have experience in programming, and know their way around basic algorithms.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,630
That's also why all of them work in very high-profile jobs.

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,670
Alice works in telecommunications; Bob works in biotech or bioinformatics,

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,060
and Carol works in finance.

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:44,650
Throughout this unit, you'll learn more about the problems that Alice, Bob, and Carol are working on,

12
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,850
and you'll also meet some additional computer scientists throughout this course.

13
00:00:48,850 --> 99:59:59,999
But let's focus on Alice first.
