1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,050
My name is Gene Gurkoff, and
I'm the founder of Charity Miles.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,933
Charity Miles is a free app that
allows people to earn money for

3
00:00:05,933 --> 00:00:08,050
charity whenever they walk,
run, or bike.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,257
I was a finance lawyer for a number of
years, and when I was in law school,

5
00:00:11,257 --> 00:00:14,992
before that I started running marathons
to raise money for Parkinson's research,

6
00:00:14,992 --> 00:00:17,220
in honor of my grandfather
who has Parkinson's.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,137
And I figured if I got
enough people together,

8
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:21,560
then collectively we would
have the clout of a celebrity.

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,300
And then companies would
want to sponsor us.

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,067
The first technological project that
I worked on was actually while I was

11
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:26,710
still a lawyer.

12
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,038
And I thought it would be really cool if
we could make something where we could

13
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:33,220
crowdsource what we think the law should
be and it totally failed [LAUGH].

14
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,590
But it was a really good experience.

15
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,701
If you're going to create an app or
you're going to be an entrepreneur,

16
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:41,150
in any field, I think there
are many moments of failure.

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,990
How you spin those failures
into a learning lesson or

18
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,800
a success that I think
are the most important.

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,010
I never would have thought of
Charity Miles if I hadn't had failures.

20
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,540
Before I got the engineers I
talked to a lot of people.

21
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,280
Just ran the idea by them just
to see what they thought.

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,550
Then I got the developers and we worked
on wireframing and designing everything.

23
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,160
All these features that,
you know, we had in there,

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,170
crammed in there, we are going to
take that out, take that out, so

25
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,500
we ended up with something
that just did one thing.

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,355
We just choose from over 30
world-class organizations from

27
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:18,090
Wounded Warrior Project to Feeding
America to World Wildlife Fund, ASPCA.

28
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,397
I'm going to choose the Michael J Fox's
Foundation for Parkinson's Research,

29
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:22,590
in honor of my grandfather.

30
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,734
And then we're going to go for
an outdoor walk, and

31
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:29,610
now thanks to Johnson &amp; Johnson,
we're able to earn money for

32
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,920
Michael J Fox Foundation for
every mile that we walk.

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,909
And this little mile counter down here
shows us how far we have walked and

34
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:41,350
if we press this we can see more so
we can again see how far we've walked.

35
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,940
And we can also in real time, the amount
of money that we've raised for

36
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,880
the Michael J Fox foundation.

37
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,620
And you know,
every mile really does matter.

38
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:54,490
So, as you continue to walk, you'll be
earning more money to cure Parkinson's.

39
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,360
And if you scroll down,

40
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,799
you can get a little bit more
information about Johnson &amp; Johnson and

41
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:00,640
the other things that they're
doing to support great charities.

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,460
And when you're done, you just press the
stop button and finish, and that's it.

43
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,550
Very simple.

44
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,482
Whether you're a social good app or just
an app, try to create value versus hype.

45
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:14,070
Try to create an app
that makes people happy,

46
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,930
that makes people healthy,
that improves life somehow.

47
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,500
You're going to have to tell investors
about it, you're going to have to tell

48
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,270
your family about it, you're going to
have to tell your friends about it.

49
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,860
And if it's not something you love
then it's going to be really boring.

50
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,390
I never get tired of talking about
Charity Miles because I love it, and

51
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,250
I feel good about being able
to share this with people.

52
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,860
So I think it would be great if the next
generation of entrepreneurs could

53
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:46,670
use apps to harness the power of crowds
to drive major advances in science.

54
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,370
The phone has so much on it from
the accelerometer to the GPS that it's

55
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,500
monitoring all this data
about us all the time.

56
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,450
And that data is super critical for
Alzheimer's, for asthma, for

57
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:03,010
heart disease those being able to
use phones and apps to crowdsource.

58
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,600
That type of scientific is
going to change the game.

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,700
I would tell potential developers
to do something that they love.

60
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,390
It's the thrill of a lifetime,
they should do it.
