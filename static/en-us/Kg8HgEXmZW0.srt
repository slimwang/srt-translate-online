1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,630
So AT&T collects data about you, and

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,700
it doesn't tell you how long
they're going to keep it.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,700
So it doesn't disclose
its retention policy.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,270
Actually we talked with Google,

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,450
it didn't do that either but
we'll get to that.

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:19,840
So they get a lower score because they
don't disclose their retention policy.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,400
They do use industry best
practices to protect the data.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,370
So this is the information security,
the data they collect,

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:32,229
how do they secure it from attacks
that can come from bad guys?

10
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,920
So they do best-practices.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,340
But other reason they lose points is
because they're not transparent about

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,860
what data government demands.

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,000
Okay, so

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,050
law enforcement department comes to them
to get information they have collected.

15
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,960
And being transparent means
you tell what kind of

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,810
requests they get from
the government and

17
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,680
what kind of data they supply
in response to those requests.

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,000
And this transparency is not there, and
because of that, they lose another star,

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,680
and that's how they end
up with very low scores.

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,330
So, both of these,
if you don't do these things,

21
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,830
should count against you
in a privacy score, yes?

22
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,640
That's what,

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,880
and this is not true in this particular
case that we're talking about.
