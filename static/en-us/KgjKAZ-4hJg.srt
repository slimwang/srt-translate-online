1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,000
As we discussed, one of the major reason for DNSs vulnerabilities is a lack of

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,520
authentication. The DNS sec protocol adds authentication

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,870
to DNS responses simply by adding signatures to

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,240
the responses that are returned for each DNS reply.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,461
When a stub resolver issues a query, assuming there is no caching, the query is

6
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:27,855
relayed by the recursive resolver to the root

7
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:30,870
name server. Which, as we know, sends a referral

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,790
to .com, but this referral includes the signature by

9
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,000
the root of the IP address and the public

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,570
key of the .com server. As long as this

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,010
resolver knows the public key corresponding to the route,

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,090
it can check the signature and it knows then,

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,950
that the referral is to the correct IP address

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,980
for .com. It also now knows the

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,930
public key corresponding to the .com server, thus

16
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,965
when the .com server sends the next referral

17
00:01:00,965 --> 00:01:04,920
to Google.com, that referral is signed by .com's

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,720
private key. But the root has told the

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,010
resolver the public key corresponding to .com, and

20
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,440
thus the resolver can check that this referral

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,970
is not bogus and in fact, came from

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,100
the .com server. Similarly, the .com server

23
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,105
will return, not only the IP address for

24
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:25,470
Google.com, but also the IP address and public

25
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,830
key for the Google.com authoritative name server. So

26
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,520
that when Google returns its answers, the

27
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,060
resolver can check the signatures coming from google.com.

28
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,990
In other words, each authoritative name server in

29
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,850
the DNS hierarchy returns not only the referral,

30
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,830
as it would with regular DNS, but also a signature containing the IP address

31
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,940
for that referral. And the public key

32
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,520
for the authoritative name server that corresponds

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,610
to that referral. That public key then

34
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,330
allows the resolver to check the signatures

35
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:03,060
at the next lowest level of the hierarchy, until we finally get to the answer.
