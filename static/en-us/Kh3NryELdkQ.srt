00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,086
>> To answer this question,
let's start by clearing our database.

2
00:00:04,086 --> 00:00:08,480
Then, we'll open up the app,
press the plus button, enter a name, and

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,060
then press the create button.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:15,360
Looks like it flashes green for the list
name node and yellow for the root node.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,610
It flashed green here because
you're adding the list name value.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,340
The route node flashes yellow

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,010
because it is the parent of
a node which has changed.

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,780
When you made additional
changes to the list name,

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,690
you'll notice it no longer flashes
green and, instead, both flash yellow.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,040
In this case, the list name is
being overwritten and not created.

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,570
Now that you know
a little more about data,

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,630
Lila will show you how to
read from the JSON database.
