00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,280
You're looking at the jQuery library.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,170
This is the entire library.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,340
Notice that it's actually just JavaScript.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,500
Let me repeat that.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,680
jQuery is just a JavaScript library.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,060
It's not a language on its own nor is it fundamentally different

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,880
than the thousands of other JavaScript libraries available.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,960
There's no magic in here that you couldn't devise yourself.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,850
If we had a week or so,

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,230
I'd be willing to bet that you could recreate a lot of jQuery's functionality.

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,759
Look at this method, isFunction.

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,402
Do you see that?

13
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:37,940
Look, it's just returning true if the object passed into it

14
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,310
has a type of function.

15
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,620
If you recreated jQuery,

16
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,380
your library probably wouldn't be as performant as jQuery.

17
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,340
But you could pretty easily recreate a lot of the same methods and

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,890
functionality that J query offers.

19
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,020
jQuery exists largely because manipulating the DOM with

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,220
vanilla JavaScript isn't always easy.

21
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,240
For instance, inserting a new DOM node with JavaScript means

22
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,319
creating an element, setting attributes and

23
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,400
content of the new node, selecting the soon-to-be parent of the new node, and

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,770
then finally inserting the new node as a child of the parent node.

25
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,030
But with jQuery, all of that is simplified to one simple function.

26
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,400
And no one wants to worry about developing Web sites for

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,890
different browsers when all you want to do is concentrate on

28
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,460
creating a Web site with a fantastic user experience.

29
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,560
jQuery exists so that you can focus on UX, not browser quirks.

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,220
But before you start writing jQuery functions,

31
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,870
I want you to take a look under jQuery's hood.
