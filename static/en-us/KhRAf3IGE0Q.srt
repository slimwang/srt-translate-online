00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,690
Paid social marketing is another way to
get your product in front of valuable

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,680
customers.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,830
Now you're probably already using social
media to engage with the community for

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,380
free, but when you want to drive
customer acquisition directly,

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,930
you can consider buying paid
marketing on social media.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:20,580
LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
Snapchat, StumbleUpon, Pinterest

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,148
are all among some of the biggest names
in paid social marketing right now.

8
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:27,250
Now there are few things you
should think about when paying for

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,970
social media marketing.

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,600
First, you need to understand
how the different ads are sold

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,920
because each network
does it differently.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,460
For example, LinkedIn and Facebook
will have you pay by impression.

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,840
On the other hand, Twitter is going to
have you pay based on engagements.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,600
Second, optimize the design
of your ad for smartphones.

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,480
Social media is overwhelmingly
consumed on mobile devices.

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,200
Over half of Facebook users visit
the site on a mobile device, and

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,750
Twitter users spend 80% of their
time on the mobile devices.

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,670
So you want to keep that in
mind with your messaging.

19
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,320
Your ad should be short and
to the point.

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,820
Your ads should also link directly
to the mobile landing page or

21
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,160
directly to the app you
want them to download.

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,700
And the settings should be aligned
to different mobile platforms youâ€™re

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,440
aiming for.

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,000
And third, have some fun with it.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,057
Explore with the different
platforms they let you do.

26
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:14,763
For example,
Twitter will let you pay for

27
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:16,337
tweets that are targeted by ZIP code.

28
00:01:16,337 --> 00:01:20,700
On the other hand, Snapchat lets
you sponsor selfies like this one.

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,338
So let's hear from the social
media marketing expert.

30
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:26,180
>> My name is Chris Morell and
I worked in social media marketing and

31
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,730
content marketing for
the last ten years or so for

32
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,520
brands including Fitbit, Clif Bar, Sony
PlayStation, and now here at Udacity.

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,490
When you're thinking about
starting with social media,

34
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,640
there's some really important
things to consider.

35
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,170
I think first and foremost,
know your audience.

36
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,820
I can't stress that enough.

37
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,060
Go and do research on your
audiences on each social platform.

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,130
Dig into analytics.

39
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,490
Dig into Twitter analytics,
Facebook analytics,

40
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,790
anything you can to get a really
good sense of your audience.

41
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,525
Make sure you're constantly listening
to what your audience is saying.

42
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:57,925
This will give you a really great
perception of your audience and

43
00:01:57,925 --> 00:02:00,925
exactly who you're trying to
market to with paid social.

44
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:04,075
The target audiences for
each social channel are going to vary.

45
00:02:04,075 --> 00:02:06,775
And I think the more that your app or
product develops and

46
00:02:06,775 --> 00:02:10,180
the more time you spend in each channel,
you're going to realize that each

47
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,950
audience has its different,
unique characteristics.

48
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,230
For example, Twitter might be really
great for customer support and

49
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,560
Instagram and Pinterest might be great
for sharing organic photo assets,

50
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,600
brand images and just really great,
engaging content.

51
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,410
It's important to really
know your demographics.

52
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,370
Do some research, use free tools, use
anything at your disposal to discover

53
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,970
age, gender and any important
demographic info that you think is

54
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,990
going to help create a better and
more successful ad campaign.

55
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,930
When you start setting up campaigns
you're also going to notice that the big

56
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,850
platforms Facebook, Twitter and
LinkedIn, they're really competitive.

57
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,490
Something to consider if you
want to stay ahead of the curve

58
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,310
is to advertise on emerging channels.

59
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,050
So think Instagram and
Pinterest, think Snapchat.

60
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,530
These aren't going to be as competitive
as channels like Twitter, Facebook,

61
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,680
LinkedIn and
you might get better returns.

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,020
Success on channels like Instagram and
Pinterest might be as simple as creating

63
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,450
experiences and
ads that feel real to the user.

64
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,600
They feel like organic posts from
our brand, and not an advertisement.
