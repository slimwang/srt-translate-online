1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,126
The center will be at negative 1 negative 2 the opposite signs of these and a

2
00:00:05,126 --> 00:00:11,606
value is 3 and the b value is 2. Nice thinking if you got these right. Now

3
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:15,584
let's check out your graph. We'll start by graphing an ellipse and the center

4
00:00:15,584 --> 00:00:21,092
is at negative 1 negative 2. We'll go one unit to the left, and two units down.

5
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:26,264
Now we use our a and b values to get the other points. Three units in the x

6
00:00:26,264 --> 00:00:31,390
direction for a, and two units in the y direction for b. We carefully construct

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,160
our rectangle around our ellipse. This is going to start our hyperbola graph.

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,154
Next, we draw on our two diagonals across the rectangle. And now we're ready to

9
00:00:40,154 --> 00:00:44,866
draw on our hyperbola. Our hyperbola will open left and right, since the x

10
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:49,031
squared term comes first. So we'll cut open our ellipse, and we'll split the

11
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:53,917
two halves outward. We'll stretch the ends of the hyperbola to our diagonals,

12
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:58,588
which gives us our final graph. Keep in mind, that the reason this parabola

13
00:00:58,588 --> 00:01:02,945
opened left and right was because the x squared term came first. It was

14
00:01:02,945 --> 00:01:07,704
positive in this case. We use the opposite signs for h and k to get our center,

15
00:01:07,704 --> 00:01:12,485
negative 1 and negative 2. These are some of the most common pit falls students

16
00:01:12,485 --> 00:01:16,854
make. So you want to make sure you pay close attention to signs and which term

17
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:19,505
comes first for hyperbolas.
