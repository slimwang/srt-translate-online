1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,880
So, the operation of putting A on B will bring us to this state.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,800
Given this state, we can have, again,

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,930
apply a means of analysis. Again, I'm not sure that all these states here, but

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,940
I'd like you to find out how many possible states are there and

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,210
how many of those states reduce the difference to the goal described.
