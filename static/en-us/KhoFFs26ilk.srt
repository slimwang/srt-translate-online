00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We're going to rule out function as our best solution, because it was a bit too messy.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But we learned in week ione that we have this incredible toll called the list comprehension.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's try that.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Using list comprehensions, we can solve this in one nice, elegant line of code.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This solution creates the exact same list that we created with our function,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and then it spits out the sum. Not bad, but it's not perfect.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What's the biggest problem with this solution?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
