1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,890
Okay, how did you do? Spectacularly well, I hope. Lets

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,740
go over the solution. Okay, so my solution looks something

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,950
like this. First we have an ordered list at the

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,560
top and bottom. You know? Opening and closing. And then

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,490
we have a for loop for going over the range from 1 to n plus 1 and then we say,

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,630
basically, if x is divisible, and we can use the

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,440
mod operator to determine if something is divisible. Mod basically

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,120
says, it gives you, it gives you the remember. So, x

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,760
is divided by 15, what is the remainder. If that, If

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,670
that's zero that means x is divisible by both 3 and

11
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,910
5 we print FizzBuzz. If it's divisible by 3 we print Fizz,

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,740
if it's divisible by 5 we print Buzz, else we just

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,920
print x. And we have our end if and our end for.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,930
Okay, not too bad huh? Now there's lots of ways of,

15
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,560
you know, if you want to minimize the logic done here but

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,340
that's not really what I'm trying to look for right here. I

17
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,760
just want to see if you can actually use your for statements

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,730
and your if statements and your

19
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,510
variable substitution. And your variable substitution

20
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,690
to make a quick little template. So if you got that, nicely done.
