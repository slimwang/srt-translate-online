One method of adding indirect illumination in a scene is to capture the effect

2
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:08,560
of surrounding light for various points in space. Here's a view of the idea

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,830
from work by Greger Et Alia in 1998. The spheres represent the captured

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,129
illumination. For a point on a surface in space, the nearby spheres are

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:21,488
accessed by the surfaces normal and blended together. There are many different

6
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:26,533
texture map types, what type of map would these spheres use? Specular map?

7
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:33,424
Normal map? Diffuse environment map? Refraction Map? Displacement Map? Or Road

8
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:33,929
map?
