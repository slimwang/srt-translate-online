1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
With the Central Limit Theorem, things become really easy.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Take a coin flip. There is a true probability p for the coin.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now we know that we sampled the coin N times and compute from it

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
our empirical mean using the formula you well know.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That it's well true that it could easily happen that p doesn't end from µ

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and that's because flipping the coin number of times is a stress and estimate of a true probability p.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now whole likely our estimates, so suppose this is a true p and I gave you three possible µ.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This one, this one, and one out here, and I put a little check marks underneath.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Check the box that is the most likely µ you might observed,

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
if p is a true probability using our statistical estimator.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And of course, it's near this one.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If it the most likely one will repeat itself and the further out you are,

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
the less likely is to have a sample that it gets you this far out.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And now, we'll be using the Central Limit Theorem.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
For large N, say N large N=30, we know that the distribution of µ you might observe is Gaussian.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,000
For any value here, let's call this one a. The chances that we observed in µ that's smaller than a

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
is the same as the surface area and then the Gaussian over here.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
There's a trick you haven't seen but the probability is driving any µ

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
is at least in the limit given by the height of this Gaussian.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So for any value a, we can compute a probability that µ becomes smaller than a.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And by symmetry, for any value of b, it's is equally away from p as a as on the left side of p,

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
they can do exactly the same thing.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Now, where does the 1.96 come from? and here's the trick, 1.96 marks the 95% confidence interval.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So we plug in the observed μ instead of the p which we don't know

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
under the Central Limit Theorem, we get the same Gaussian

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and then we compute the x which μ-x or μ+x give us these decision boundaries

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
such as the total area in these two tails over here is exactly 0.05. That's the same as 5%.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In fact, you placed half of this on the left side and half of it on the right side.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:49,000
When that's the case, the confidence interval itself carries 95% of all possible values for p,

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
so the chances that p lies outside the green confidence interval is 5%,

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
hence, we call it a 95% confidence interval.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let me ask you a quiz. Suppose you go from 95% to 90%,

33
00:03:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
does this make x smaller, larger, or will there be no change. Which one is it?
