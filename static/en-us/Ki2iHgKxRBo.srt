1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,530
This class is divided into
three subclasses, three parts.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,010
They are supervised learning.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,670
>> Yeah.
>> Unsupervised learning,

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,470
and reinforcement.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,145
So, what do you think
supervised learning is?

6
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:17,510
>> So, I think of supervised learning
as being the problem of taking labelled

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:23,057
data sets, gleaning information from
it so that you can label new data sets.

8
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:24,138
>> That's fair.

9
00:00:24,138 --> 00:00:26,355
I call that function approximation.

10
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:28,798
So, here's an example
of supervised learning.

11
00:00:28,798 --> 00:00:31,342
I'm going to give you an input and
an output.

12
00:00:31,342 --> 00:00:32,912
And I'm going to give
them to you as pairs, and

13
00:00:32,912 --> 00:00:34,360
I want you to guess
what the function is.

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,441
>> Sure.
>> Okay?

15
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:36,185
Okay.

16
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:36,845
1, 1.

17
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:37,925
>> Uh-huh.

18
00:00:37,925 --> 00:00:38,784
2, 4.

19
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:40,920
>> Wait, hang on,
is 1 the input and 1 the output,.

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,840
>> Yes.
>> And 2 the input, and 4 the output?

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,057
>> Correct.
>> All right.

22
00:00:44,057 --> 00:00:45,820
I'm on, I think I am on to you.

23
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,440
>> 3, 9.

24
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,628
>> Okay.
>> 4, 16.

25
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:48,383
>> Nice.

26
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:49,148
>> 5, 25.

27
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:50,426
6, 36.

28
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:51,446
7, 49.

29
00:00:51,446 --> 00:00:52,666
>> Nice.

30
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,503
This is a very hip data set.

31
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:54,349
>> It is.

32
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:56,010
What's the function?
>> It's hip to be squared.

33
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,200
>> Exactly.

34
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,490
Maybe.

35
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,660
So if you believe that's true,

36
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,150
then tell me if the input is 10,
what's the output?

37
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,519
>> 100.
>> And that's right, if it turns out,

38
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,880
in fact, that the function is x squared.

39
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,920
But the truth is, we have no idea
whether this function is x squared.

40
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,800
Not really.
>> I have a pretty good idea.

41
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,360
>> You do?
>> Well-

42
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,760
>> Where's that idea come from?

43
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,070
>> It comes from having spoken with
you over a long period of time.

44
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,990
And plus, you know, math.

45
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,970
>> And plus math.

46
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,430
Well, I'm going to-

47
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,100
>> You can't say I'm wrong.

48
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,230
>> You're wrong.

49
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,060
>> Oh.
>> Yeah, I did.

50
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,910
>> You just said I was wrong.

51
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,330
>> No, you've talked to me for
a long time, and plus math.

52
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,280
I agree with that.

53
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
>> Okay.
>> But

54
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,510
I'm going to claim that you're
making a leap of faith.

55
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,110
>> Hm.
>> Despite being a scientist,

56
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,019
by deciding that the input is 10 and
the output is 100.

57
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,250
>> Sure.
I would agree with that.

58
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,562
>> What's that leap of faith?

59
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:44,903
>> Well, I mean, from what you told me,
it's still consistent with lots of

60
00:01:44,903 --> 00:01:48,840
other mappings from input to
output like 10 gets mapped to 11.

61
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,046
>> Right or
everything is x squared except 10.

62
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:51,603
>> Sure.

63
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:53,344
>> Or everything is x,
x squared up to 10.

64
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:54,365
>> Right, that would be mean-

65
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:55,446
>> That would be mean-

66
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:57,802
>> But it's not logically impossible.

67
00:01:57,802 --> 00:01:59,161
>> What would be the median?

68
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,100
>> A-ha.

69
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,727
>> Thank you very much.

70
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:01,955
I, I was saving that one up.
