00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,636
Well right here, is the point that's the minimum, the vertex of the parabola. It

2
00:00:04,636 --> 00:00:09,150
looks like its height, or its vertical coordinate is 3 and its horizontal

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,089
coordinate is 2. Since the vertex of an upward facing parabola represents the

4
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:18,953
minimum point on the entire curve, 3 is the lowest y value, or lowest value of f

5
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:21,908
of x, that any point on this fuction will have.
