1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Just to shake things up, let's get started on the right.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Here our start symbol is S and it goes to PQR and there actually aren't that many choices.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If we think about it, there are two strings in this grammar--PQR and PQ nothing.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So this doesn't look like a good bet because it doesn't produce PQQ, or P, or PR.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is not a match. All right. What do we have over here?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, every string is going to have to start with lowercase p and then Q,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
looks like I can have 0 or more Qs and then eventually we end with an R.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This looks pretty good because it matches the first string

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and the string down here, but it doesn't get PQQ so I don't like this one.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
How about this grammar in the middle that uses ABC instead of Senatus Populus Que Romany

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
in the name of the senate and the people of Rome--A, B and C?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, we have two choices for our start symbol that definitely complicates things,

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
but both of them start with a P--well that's convenient

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
since all five of our strings starts with a P.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's just go through the strings one at a time. Can I get P alone?

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes. A goes to PB. B goes to nothing--so I can get that one. How about PQQ?

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
A goes to PB. B goes to Q and then Q again and then nothing. Yeah, I can get that one.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
How about PR? A goes to PBC. B goes to nothing. C goes to R.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is looking super promising. PQR--we use the first rule-PBC.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We'll gather up one Q and then we'll have an R. Great! PQQR. We use the first rule--PBC.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We'll go around this loop twice to get two Qs and then end with an R.
