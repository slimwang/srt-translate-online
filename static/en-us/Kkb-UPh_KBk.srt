1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
When we think about the money is it's really a promise from a trusted bank.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If the promise it says if someone brings this money to the bank,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
the bank will exchange it for something of real value.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today, we think of the paper itself as having real value.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But in the early days, what the paper meant was you could go to the bank

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and exchange it for something that everyone would recognize as real value,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
say a bar of gold--almost as valuable as a gold star.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If that's what money means, well then we should be able to do the same thing with cryptography.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's see how that would work.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Alice would go to Indivisible Prime Bank, which everyone knows is very trustworthy,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and she would give to the bank a $100 in some other currency,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
let's assume the bank to take US dollars.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The bank will read the message that says, "The bank owes the bearer of this note $100."

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The bank will send Alice a signed version of that message.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The message, along with its signature, which is signed by the bank using the bank's private key,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
signing a hash of that message.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This signature proves that it is a valid IOU from this bank,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and now Alice has something representing currency.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now Alice could spend the currency. She could buy some tacos from Bob's Taco Emporium.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Give him the currency. Pretty expensive tacos.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And Bob could take the note--this signed message from the bank--

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and give it to the bank and ask the bank to deposit into his account.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now the question is how well would the scheme that I've described work?

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let's assume that everyone in the universe trusts Indivisible Primes

25
00:01:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and knows that bank's public key.
