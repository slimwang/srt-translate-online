00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,578
>> Genomics is the study of all the hereditary material,

2
00:00:03,578 --> 00:00:06,455
or DNA, that makes up who you are. Now, until about

3
00:00:06,455 --> 00:00:08,915
a decade ago, it wasn't even possible to look at

4
00:00:08,915 --> 00:00:11,833
your whole genome at one time. We were only looking at

5
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:15,263
bits and pieces of your genome, regions we called genes,

6
00:00:15,263 --> 00:00:19,406
individually, in a field called genetics. And eventually over time the

7
00:00:19,406 --> 00:00:22,517
field of genetics, looking at these individual genes one at

8
00:00:22,517 --> 00:00:25,708
a time blossomed into this field of genomics. Now the global

9
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,268
picture of genomics is to get a global picture of

10
00:00:28,268 --> 00:00:30,914
you. Looking at many genes at one time to see

11
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:33,970
how they shape who you are. Obviously, this is a

12
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,840
pretty big task and we could use a little bit

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,110
of help. We've teamed up with 23andMe, a personal genetics

14
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,970
company based in California that aims to connect people with

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,460
their own genomes. I'd like to introduce to all of

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,316
you the Senior Director of Research at 23andMe, Joanna Mountain.

17
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:51,351
>> Thank you, Matt. I'm really excited to be part of Tales from the Genome.

18
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,191
>> Well, we're pretty excited to have you here. I'm curious, is there any

19
00:00:54,191 --> 00:00:56,470
trait about yourself that you've always wondered

20
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,257
more about what the genetic cause is?

21
00:00:58,257 --> 00:01:00,316
>> I have to say, I was always curious

22
00:01:00,316 --> 00:01:02,801
about why I had red hair and freckles and no

23
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:05,036
one else in my family did. And where did

24
00:01:05,036 --> 00:01:07,774
that come from? Yeah, how did I get so lucky?

25
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:08,139
[LAUGH]

26
00:01:08,139 --> 00:01:12,227
And so that's something that I was curious about for much of my

27
00:01:12,227 --> 00:01:14,790
life. And when I was able to look into my DNA, I could

28
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,273
start to learn more about who I might have inherited that from, and,

29
00:01:19,273 --> 00:01:22,690
and what the genetic basis was for, for that red hair and freckling.

30
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,950
>> Now I'm sure some of you out there

31
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,270
have wondered about your own traits, so tell us.

32
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,250
What's one trait about yourself that you've always wanted

33
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,390
to know a bit more about the genetic basis for?
