1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,660
Okay, so to understand better
how the order book works and

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,080
how exchanges work, let's look
at a couple more example orders.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,207
For brevity I'm leaving
out the symbol IBM.

4
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:14,990
This is all about IBM, so
just keep that in mind.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay, so a market order comes
in to buy 100 shares at market.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,893
So again, we see that there's 1,000
shares that people are willing to sell.

7
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:29,134
And the exchange has to give
the best price to the client, and so

8
00:00:29,134 --> 00:00:32,348
we give the client 100
shares at this price.

9
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:34,530
So what happens, the order comes in.

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,319
100 shares go away.

11
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:38,640
And now the order book
has changed just so

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,811
that there's 900 shares available
here now instead of 1,000.

13
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:47,312
And the execution price is $100.

14
00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's consider now a limit order.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,624
Someone wants to buy again 100
shares at a limit of 100.02.

16
00:00:55,624 --> 00:00:59,212
So, again looking at the order book,
again,

17
00:00:59,212 --> 00:01:03,380
we can satisfy that order and,
again, at $100.

18
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,610
So we're saying that we want
to pay no more then $100.02.

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,660
So again, we can execute at 100, and

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:17,410
now this goes down to 800 shares
instead of 900 being available.

21
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,830
And the execution price for
this transaction again, is $100.

22
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:27,060
And note also that that's less
than that limit price of $100.02.

23
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,260
Let's look now at one last order,

24
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,890
a market order,
where someone wants to sell 175 shares.

25
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,210
So that comes in.

26
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,770
And we have 100 shares available
at 99.95, so those get sold.

27
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,330
And there's none left
there at that price.

28
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:52,290
So a 100 shares get executed at 99.95.

29
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,290
So to get this 75 more shares,
we need to go deeper into the book.

30
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,160
So we'll take these 50, 0 left there.

31
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,340
We still need 25 more shares
to meet this order for 175.

32
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,050
So we go even deeper into the book and
take some of these.

33
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,073
So after all these transactions,

34
00:02:11,073 --> 00:02:14,293
the order book has been
changed quite substantially.

35
00:02:14,293 --> 00:02:18,595
And this client gets
a 100 shares at 99.95,

36
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:22,457
50 at 99.90, and 25 at 99.05.

37
00:02:22,457 --> 00:02:27,450
So all together, there's some average
price at which this was executed for

38
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,720
that client.

39
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,590
Note now that as time has gone on, the
executed prices have been decreasing.

40
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,080
Clearly we're seeing
that's a consequence of

41
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,920
there's much more sell
pressure than buy pressure.

42
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,440
So that's how the order book works and
how exchanges

43
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,109
use order books to facilitate
transactions between their clients.

44
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,210
This is what an order book
looks like in real life.

45
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,100
Here in the middle, we have prices.

46
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,900
And on either side here,
we see the order sizes.

47
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,150
We're seeing here, sell orders and
how large they are, and

48
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,990
on this other side, buy orders and
how large they are.

49
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,910
And the prices that they're being
executed here are in the middle.

50
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,290
And as you can see,
it's changing dynamically and

51
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,440
rapidly as trades are executed.

52
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,750
Here we see a price chart showing
how the prices is going up and

53
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,270
down as these trades are being executed.

54
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,030
So that's a live order book.

55
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,590
This is using the trading
platform called Think or Swim.
