00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
As we go deeper the force of gravity shrinks,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and it does so by a factor of 2.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's see in detail why this has to be the case.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The trick is to add an imaginary sphere of half the radius.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Then we can look at the force from the core part

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and the force from the shell,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and this is where the name "shell theorem" comes from.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The core part is again a sphere

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
as is the complete object, so we can compare what's going to happen as we go

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
from the large sphere to the small sphere.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Distance is multiplied by 1/2 as we go down that hole.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The mass is multiplied by 1/8 as we are shrinking the original sphere

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
to half of its radius.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We're shrinking the volume to 1/8.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And hence the mass to 1/8 of the original value.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If we take these two together, the original force will be multiplied 1/8,

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
because the mass appears in the numerator,

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
divided by 1/2 squared, because the distance squared appears in the denominator.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And in total, this is a factor of 1/2.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And to see what's happening with the force from the shell,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
let's put an imaginary sphere close to the inside of that shell.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If there is a gravitational force on the surface of that sphere,

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
it has to be rotationally symmetric, for instance, like that.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Can this be? No. Where would the water be flowing?

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We would have to drain that water somewhere, which we don't.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Can the force points to the outside? No.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Where would that water come from in the first place?

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So the only reasonable value for the magnitude of the force is 0.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And hence, in total, the force goes down to 1/2 of its original value.
