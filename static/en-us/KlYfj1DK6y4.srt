00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,550
Lets put together what we've
learned to draw a smiley face.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,380
We'll use ShapeRenderer to draw
the circles and arcs, and we'll also use

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,160
an orthographic camera and
an ExtendViewPort to frame the scene.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,720
The tricky part is going
to be drawing the mouth.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,830
Since we can't draw lines thicker
than a single pixel without

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,490
Open GL monkey business that doesn't
work everywhere, making a thick line for

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,400
the mouth is going to be hard.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,130
The trick is to draw two arcs.

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:30,930
First, draw a black arc, and then you
can draw a slightly smaller yellow arc.

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,690
The portion of the black arc that
isn't covered by the yellow arc

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,310
becomes the mouth.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,960
All right, check out the course
code to give it a try.
