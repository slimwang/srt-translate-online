1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,270
So I started as a pilot
in the Israeli Air Force,

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,550
which is a very entrepreneurial place.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,854
When I finished that, I started my
first company and like many of them,

4
00:00:09,854 --> 00:00:11,190
it was not very successful.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,994
And then I started my second company
which luckily was more successful which

6
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:18,275
I sold many years ago,
talking about close to 20 years ago now.

7
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:21,792
After that I started my
journey to the dark side and

8
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:27,580
moved to become an executive in
the company that acquired my company.

9
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,911
Moved on there up to being a CEO, then
became the CEO of another company and

10
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:32,273
then built another company.

11
00:00:32,273 --> 00:00:33,706
Last company I ran for

12
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:39,740
five years was a publicly traded company
in London called 888 Gaming Company.

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,253
Around 1500 people
dealing with internet and

14
00:00:42,253 --> 00:00:45,319
started investing in companies or
11 years ago as a hobby.

15
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:48,710
A friend came to me with
an idea I really like the idea.

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,235
I gave him a bit of money and
the lot of advice and then after a year,

17
00:00:53,235 --> 00:00:56,539
I got a big fat check and
I said well I can do that.

18
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:57,790
I love that.

19
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,540
And so I took all that money and
I decided I'm going to reinvest it in

20
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,090
other companies and I was very lucky
in that some of the companies I chose

21
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,400
became more successful and
so I continued with it.

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,479
And so over the years,
I invested in quite a few companies.

23
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,210
And then when I left my last corporate
role five years ago, I decided that it's

24
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,296
going to be a good idea to not take
another big ugly corporate role and

25
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:23,401
instead of it just stick to
the entrepreneurship and investments.

26
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:25,080
And that's what I've been
doing the last five years.
