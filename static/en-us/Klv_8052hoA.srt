00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,230
Let's say we want to know how a song about the content are used to teach the

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,556
content might impact engagement. We're going to set up for a hypothesis test,

3
00:00:09,556 --> 00:00:13,196
which will compare our current population with what we predict will be our new

4
00:00:13,196 --> 00:00:18,512
population after this treatment or intervention. Remember, in a hypothesis

5
00:00:18,512 --> 00:00:23,119
test, we have the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. And the null

6
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,831
is that there's no significant difference between the population after the

7
00:00:26,831 --> 00:00:32,920
intervention is given and the current population parameter. And the alternative

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,804
could be one of three things, that the current population is less than what it

9
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:42,280
will be after the intervention, that it's greater, or that it's just different.

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,383
In this example, what could the null hypothesis be? Check all that apply.
