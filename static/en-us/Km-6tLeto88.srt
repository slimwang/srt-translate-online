1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,019
And the answer here is that--yes, I think you should play the game

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,070
well, at least, if you're okay with playing games with money.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,730
So with the probability of 5/6, you're making 30% profit,

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,510
and with the probability of 1/6, you're making 100% loss.

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:24,050
So, your expected profit for each time you play is going to be 25% of this part over here

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:30,330
minus about 16.7% for this part over here, which means each time you play,

7
00:00:30,330 --> 99:59:59,999
you make about 8.3% of profit on average as an expected value of course.
