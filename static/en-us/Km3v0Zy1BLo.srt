00:00:00,481 --> 00:00:05,327
I can't think of anything right now, but it, I think, it's going to be along,

2
00:00:05,327 --> 00:00:08,779
along the lines of it's going to be hard to extend it,

3
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:11,220
functionality later on at this point.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,350
>> You're getting there.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,060
And, and, you mentioned something about this this earlier on.

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,275
One hint to all this, is we have designed three classes that

7
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:22,890
satisfy the requirements of the coffee maker spec, but they, as yet,

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,150
don't depend on the specifics of the Mark 4.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,410
If when we added the methods, we were explicitly include calls to the API, then

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,160
we couldn't reuse those classes when next years version, the Mark 5, comes out.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,100
A better approach is to use a technique called dependency inversion.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,120
Let's see how that works.
