1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,190
So the Generalized Hough transform or

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,200
Generalize Hough transform algorithm is very easy.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,593
If the orientation is known,

4
00:00:07,593 --> 00:00:11,059
you know the orientation of the object, you do exactly what I showed you.

5
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:15,165
For each edge point, you compute the gradient direction, you retrieve

6
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:19,675
the displacement vectors r for that direction to vote for the reference point,

7
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:23,680
and the peak in this space, in this case, we're only voting in X, Y.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,720
That's the reference point, that's where your object is.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,730
It's the one with the most, sort of, supporting edges.

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,370
Now, it's sort of unreasonable that you might know the orientation and

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,480
the scale, so let's talk about orientation.

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,250
Okay? Supposed the orientation is not known.

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,450
Well, all we have to do is try the different possible orientations, and

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,210
that's written here, again for each edge point.

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,610
But now, we have a, what we'll call a master orientation.

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,280
This is the actual orientation of the object.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,330
For each orientation, possible master orientation,

18
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,990
we compute the gradient direction, but we subtract off the master.

19
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,260
So the master here is this theta star, the actual gradient is theta.

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,660
But the, the gradient we're going to use is this theta prime,

21
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:12,450
which is just the gradient with the overall orientation subtracted off of it.

22
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,750
And so now, we retrieve the displacement vectors for theta prime.

23
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,924
So we're still voting, and peaks in this Hough space are the reference point,

24
00:01:22,924 --> 00:01:26,765
but notice now that we're voting in X and Y and also theta star.

25
00:01:26,765 --> 00:01:30,240
So you remember that space complexity, which is k to the n?

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,680
Well, n just went from being two to three, and the bottom line is any

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,040
decent sized number squared is much smaller than any decent sized number cubed.

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,010
So you just got a lot bigger by going to this adding this orientation.

29
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,390
What's kind of cool by the way and this was in the original arbitrary shapes

30
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,880
paper, you could also do this for say scale.

31
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,570
Suppose the scale was unknown, our algorithm looks stunningly similar for

32
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,330
each edge point.

33
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,260
But now instead of having a master theta, right?

34
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,090
We have a master scale.

35
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,840
So for each possible master scale, we again compute the gradient direction.

36
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,508
We again retrieve the displacement vectors, but now we have to

37
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:15,440
vote with the scaled displacement, the vector scaled by S.

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,190
And again we vote, whichever gets the most votes is the right point.

39
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,520
And the peaks in this space and

40
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,670
now the space is X, Y and S where S is the scale.

41
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,320
So again, it's cubic.

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,970
Now you can imagine that if you had scale and

43
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,535
orientation, that would be quartic, that's raised to the 4th.

44
00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:34,430
Modest numbers raised to the fourth power are brutal, so

45
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,490
you have to be careful in terms of how you do this.
