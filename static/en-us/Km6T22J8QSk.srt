1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Accuracy is an obvious issue with our computer-based solution.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
To check what the computer does, the easiest way to learn

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
what goes wrong with the computer simulation is to use a toy example,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which we can compute by hand as well.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This toy example will be a circular orbit.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A space craft moving around earth for instance with the earth at the center of this orbit.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's call the radius of that orbit r and let's call the orbital period

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the time its takes for one orbit capital T.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The velocity vector of that spacecraft will be tangential to that orbit

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and the speed that is the length of that velocity vector.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The speed will be constant and we can't easily compute the speed.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It takes the spacecraft amount of time, capital T, to go around that circumference

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and the time capital T, the distance traveled by the space craft is 2 πr circumference of that orbit.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The acceleration vector of these points perpendicular

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
to that orbit to the center of the earth.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The acceleration does not change the speed, the length of the velocity vector that is,

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
it simply changes the direction of that vector.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We can compute the length of that acceleration vector in a similar fashion. This goes as follows.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We start with the velocity vector that takes us up

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and then we move and then the velocity vector changes to the left.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
At this point, it points to the left and eventually it goes round to full circle.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
After one orbital period, it's going to be that blue vector again with phase shift of 90°.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So we can't say that the velocity vector executes the same circular motion

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
as does the position vector that we have a phase shift of 90° between them.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Nonetheless, we can still apply the same equation.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It takes us one orbital period to make one full revolution and that has a length of 2 π*r.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
All of these vectors have the length of 2 πr/T.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So the circumference would be 2π times this radius 2 πr/T, which boils down to (2π)² r/T².

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So given the radius and the orbital period of this circular motion,

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
we can determine what the speed is and what the acceleration is.
