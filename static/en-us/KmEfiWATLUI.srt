00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,288
The correct answer is negative 2.5. Call the formula for the t statistic x bar

2
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:09,135
minus mu, divided by the standard error of the mean. So we have 126 minus 151

3
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:15,716
divided by 10, gives us negative 25 divided by 10, equals negative 2.5.
