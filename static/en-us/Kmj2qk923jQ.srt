00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,050
What are some approaches to coping with

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:07,060
inconsistency? Running different controllers for different switches, keeping

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,350
a hot spare replica that has a complete

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,650
view of the network state, keeping the old

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,790
and new state on the routers and switches

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,820
and switching over only when all of the

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,760
switches have received the new state Or relying

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,250
on the routers themselves to resolve the conflict.
