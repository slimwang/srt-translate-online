1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,718
First things first.

2
00:00:01,718 --> 00:00:07,550
There are too many fields and
a lot of them are completely irrelevant.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,950
Why is this form asking for
a middle initial?

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,660
First off, not everyone has one.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,401
And secondly,
it's just not necessary for a checkout.

6
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:18,676
Same thing with age and gender.

7
00:00:18,676 --> 00:00:22,850
This is a checkout form not a census.

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,100
And still, why is age a drop down?

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,230
Isn't that a number?

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,880
Anyway, there's Confirm Email Address
which just annoys me,

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,450
like I don't know how to
type it the first time?

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,340
Don't put these on your forms.

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,440
I could keep going.

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,430
There are a lot of examples of
totally irrelevant information here.

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,420
And the layout isn't that great either.

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,300
The form doesn't try to help you out.

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,596
There's no indication of progress, and
nothing is being validated whatsoever.

18
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:53,102
So, it looks like you'll
have your work cut out for

19
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:55,390
you at the end of this
lesson when you fix this.
