00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,776
As Susan said, these drugs depress the central nervous system, which is the

2
00:00:04,776 --> 00:00:09,926
opposite of what stimulants do. That's why benzodiazepines are often used to

3
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:14,214
treat anxiety. Barbiturates are not used as often today to treat anxiety

4
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:19,672
because they are not as safe as benzodiazepines. People are more likely to

5
00:00:19,672 --> 00:00:24,074
overdose on barbiturates than benzodiazepines. Also, if barbiturates are

6
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:28,595
consumed with alcohol, it can cause death. Barbiturates, are however, used to

7
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:33,075
treat some medical conditions, such as epilepsy, because they often help to

8
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:38,730
suppress seizure activity. Alcohol is not used today in an official medical

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,600
sense. However, it's a widely abused drug that people use to self-medicate.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,590
That is, they may use it to help them cope with problems in their life.

11
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:54,856
However, it is important to know that alcohol is a drug. You may hear people

12
00:00:54,856 --> 00:01:01,990
say alcohol and drugs, when in fact it should be alcohol and other drugs.

13
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,266
You'll now be able to point that out to be people when you hear such a mistake,

14
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:08,270
because you know that alcohol is a drug.
