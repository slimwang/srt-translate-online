1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,240
Next, we will use the content
resolver to call this method query.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,310
This query method is
part of a set of four,

3
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:10,029
mapping to the four CRUD
methods mentioned earlier.

4
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:12,099
Just like with a SQL live database,

5
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:15,179
there are four basic things that you
can do with the content provider.

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,660
You can read from the data,
add a row or rows to the data,

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,170
update the data, or delete a row or
rows from the data.

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,740
These actions amount
to four basic methods.

9
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:29,449
Query, insert, update, and delete.

10
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:33,869
So basically, you specify what you want
to do, by calling contentresolver dot,

11
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:35,890
and then one of those methods.

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,159
Then the content resolver tells your
content provider to perform that action.

13
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,500
You want to read data from the content
provider, not change anything.

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,869
So, you'll be calling the query method.
