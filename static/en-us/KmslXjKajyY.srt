1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,410
This work would not be correct, since we know that four-eighths would be equal

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,546
to one-half. More importantly, we know that this step cannot be correct. The

3
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:12,377
student tried to simplify terms in the numerator and in the denominator.

4
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:17,220
Remember terms are separated by addition or subtraction. We cannot cancel terms,

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,960
but we can cancel factors. Factors are numbers or variables that are multiplied

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,264
in the numerator or denominator. For example, if we started with six-12ths. We

7
00:00:26,264 --> 00:00:31,946
can rewrite the 6 as 2 times 3, and 12 as 2 times 6. We can simplify the factors

8
00:00:31,946 --> 00:00:37,594
of 2, since these cancel out to equal 1. This would leave us with 3 6. We repeat

9
00:00:37,594 --> 00:00:42,712
this process one more time by rewriting 3 and 6 with factors. We can cancel the

10
00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:47,544
3s, since they make an equivalence of 1. This leaves us with one half. So

11
00:00:47,544 --> 00:00:51,899
whenever we're working throughout this unit keep in mind that we can't cancel

12
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,321
terms, we can only cancel factors, things that are multiplied in the numerator

13
00:00:56,321 --> 00:01:01,288
and in the denominator. And finally, we know 5/8 cannot be simplified since 5

14
00:01:01,288 --> 00:01:06,273
and 8 do not share a common factor. So we also need to include this reason.
