1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,050
There is a specialist for
each of these body systems.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,490
A cardiologist for the heart.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,390
A pulmonary specialist for the lungs.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,220
An endocrinologist for diabetes.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,050
And an internist to manage hypertension.

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,510
Unless Marla develops a particularly
severe issue, a PCP might manage

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,060
all of these problems,
with occasional help from a specialist.

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,050
Since she doesn't have a PCP,
she ends up just seeing specialists.

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,620
Unless things change, this trend toward
specialty care is projected to grow.

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,420
By now you're probably wondering
why this is a problem.

11
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,950
Primary care physicians have been shown

12
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,110
to deliver similar quality to
specialists for certain conditions,

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:52,630
such as diabetes and hypertension,
often while using fewer resources.

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,420
They often provide better
preventative care than specialists,

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,640
reflecting their ability to better
manage the whole health of patients and

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,190
can help reduce hospitalization rates.
