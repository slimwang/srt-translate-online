Okay, here is our little load balancer simulator. I've give

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,540
you a list of servers, servers 1, 2, 3, and

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,720
4. And I'd like you to implement the function get_server

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,420
that returns which server we should send our connection to. It

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,780
should return in order 1, 2, 3, 4 and then

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,300
cycle back over to return 1. There are a number of

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,160
ways of doing this in Python. I'll include some links

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,190
in the instructor comments for some different approaches that might work.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,800
The way we'll test it is, we'll just call your function

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,470
a bunch of times and see what it returns. So, good luck.
