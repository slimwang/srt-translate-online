00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,572
>> Now, if we don't look at these, you've seen that the average salary of

2
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:09,454
Geography majors is about 48,000. However, in the mid 1980s, the average

3
00:00:09,454 --> 00:00:14,668
starting salary of Geography students at the University of North Carolina was

4
00:00:14,668 --> 00:00:20,008
well over 100,000. Why was this? Well, maybe UNC had a really good Geography

5
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:25,684
program or UNC's career services program found top-tier jobs for students, or

6
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:31,346
maybe salaries in North Carolina were just higher in the 1980s. Actually, it's

7
00:00:31,346 --> 00:00:36,741
because Michael Jordan graduated from there and his starting salary was over

8
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:42,122
$500,000. So, you saw that the mode isn't influenced by an outlier at all, but

9
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:46,865
the mean is influenced a lot. We need something in between. This is where the

10
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:49,755
median comes in, which is the middle of the data.
