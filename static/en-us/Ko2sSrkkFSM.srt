1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,990
Writing these out as equations so

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,540
the prediction can be
thought of as this way.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,730
What is the next predicted state
of the object here, here and

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,980
back to x of t given t minus 1,
given all the previous measurements?

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,600
Okay?

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,210
So you see here that it says
given y from 0 to t minus 1 so

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,630
those are all the measurements up until
before t, make a prediction at time t.

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,690
Correction is again I want
a distribution, remember I'm

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:37,290
coming up with a probability
distribution of x t, given what's new.

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,080
Well what's new is I have
my new measurement, okay?

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,800
So basically, this was my prediction
based upon my measurements up until t.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,390
Then when I'm done,

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,100
I should have a prediction
including the current measurement.

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,840
So basically, the tracking is this
propagating what's called as I said

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,490
the posterior distribution, posterior
density of state, given the measurement.

16
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,630
So this term here,

17
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,570
this is my posterior because it's after
I've taken the measurement at time t.
