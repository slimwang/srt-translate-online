You've had some practice expanding logarithmic expressions, so now let's try

2
00:00:04,118 --> 00:00:09,794
one that has a natural log. Here I have ln of the square root of 4x minus 6

3
00:00:09,794 --> 00:00:15,046
over 3. Now, eventually, we can try expanding this using the quotient property,

4
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:18,518
but first, all I'd like us to do, is just rewrite the numerator here using an

5
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:22,279
exponent instead of the radical sign.
