1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,588
It's a little bit tricky, because
the width is defined at 640 pixels.

2
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:08,390
But the max-width is set to 100%.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,670
The max-width actually overrides the
width, which means that the owl image

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,920
will be kept contained within its
container, so this one is responsive.

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,190
Looking at the logo,
we see its width is 125 pixels.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,190
This is actually fine, because 125
pixels is pretty much smaller than any

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,520
device, so this one will actually
work well and be responsive.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,900
This one is actually a little dangerous.

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,820
Even though the width isn't really that
large, the viewport width on some of

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,180
the smaller devices can be as low
as 320 pixels, which means that

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:46,500
a box with a width of 350 pixels could
cause some horizontal scrolling.

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,590
So this one isn't responsive.

13
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,370
And finally, with the city div,
we see its width is 100%,

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,570
which means it's always relative and
will be responsive.
