1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,009
Have you thought any more
about offline access?

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:03,920
>> Mm-hm.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,410
>> I'm just thinking about the gift
shopping I'll be doing during my

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,950
vacation in Hawaii.

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,310
I'm not sure how my cell network
access is going to be out there and

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,220
it'd be really good to not lose
all my shopping list data when

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,510
the internet connection is flaky.

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,711
>> Well.
>> Well,

9
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:22,157
I guess it's a fair point but,
I don't know the more you think about it

10
00:00:22,157 --> 00:00:24,880
the more tricky it sounds
like it be to set up.

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,598
So first of all you need to be caching
the data locally somewhere which would

12
00:00:28,598 --> 00:00:32,210
necessitate using maybe a sequel like
database or something like that.

13
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,255
You'd also be needing to cache kind
of the stuff that the user does when

14
00:00:36,255 --> 00:00:37,900
the app is offline.

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,790
So say you were to buy.

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,378
I don't know some tiki masks or
something offline.

17
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:45,410
You would then need to send
that data that you bought that

18
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,340
to the phone when you reconnect.

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,770
And frankly, we just don't have the
engineering resources right now to even

20
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,660
start implementing that.

21
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,660
>> Firebase is actually doing some
caching by default as well as

22
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,940
queuing any actions your
user makes offline.

23
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,720
>> Well, actually that's awesome.

24
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,450
In that case don't we just
get offline access for free?

25
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,460
>> Some of the time.

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,550
>> Okay, well.

27
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,990
I'm wrapped up in important
business decisions.

28
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,790
So maybe you can talk to the developer
about all that offline stuff.

29
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,500
>> Sure.
You do know your camera is on right now?

30
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,090
>> Yes, yes it is
>> Okay let's talk a little

31
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,030
about how Firebase deals with offline
access and data in general and

32
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,890
what you get for free.

33
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,540
We have two clients your phone
in my phone for example.

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,120
And let's say my phone isn't connected.

35
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,760
Maybe I put my phone into airplane mode.

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,880
But I still have shopping list
plus plus up on my device.

37
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,450
In this situation,
my client keeps a local cache.

38
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,570
This includes all the data that was in
the app the last time I had access.

39
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,330
I can keep making changes and
see them immediately.

40
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,540
In actuality,

41
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,250
every client of Firebase app maintains
its own version of active data.

42
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,310
And changes made for
this local copy of the database trigger

43
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,860
actions locally first before
data gets written to the server.

44
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,570
So it's not just a matter
of it works offline.

45
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,860
It's actually by design.

46
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,940
Anyway when I'm connected again,

47
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,720
the app will get updated based
on the changes I made offline.

48
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,680
In that situation my client will push
the correct events to the server,

49
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,360
the ones I made offline, and

50
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,150
I will get the changes from the server
based on the changes you made.

51
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,720
This is what you get for
free with Firebase.
