00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,130
Our student just learned Java.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:02,950
>> That's amazing.

3
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:03,560
>> It's huge.

4
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,800
>> It is huge.

5
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,420
They also learned how to
add a button on the app.

6
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,220
Click on the button,
something happens magically.

7
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,217
It's called event-driven programming.

8
00:00:10,217 --> 00:00:11,260
>> Oh, yeah.
>> You know it, we know it,

9
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:11,860
they know it, now.

10
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,340
>> Yeah, now they know it.

11
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,405
And we also learned about variables.

12
00:00:16,405 --> 00:00:17,050
>> Mm-hm.

13
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,420
>> Which is what makes the quantity
picker go up and down.

14
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,330
>> Correct.

15
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,010
Alice, the Android developer,
made a guest appearance.

16
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,920
>> Oh yeah, Alice.
>> She was talking about how she gets

17
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,535
unstuck when she comes across a bug.

18
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:27,080
>> Mm-hm.

19
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,120
Those are some good tips.

20
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,080
>> Right.
>> Yeah.

21
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,970
>> So, do you know what that means?

22
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:31,760
>> We're basically done.

23
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,570
>> We're done with lesson two.

24
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,070
>> Nice.

25
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,060
>> You done with that?

26
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:36,585
>> Yeah.
>> I think so.

27
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:38,430
>> because we closed an hour ago.

28
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,310
>> Oh, sorry.
>> Oh, sorry.

29
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,940
>> I'll take it from here.
