1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,573
And the way we do that is the process
is called de-identification.

2
00:00:04,573 --> 00:00:07,980
De-identification essentially
says drop or

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,050
remove all the values that
identify a particular user.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,583
Now, de-identification
alone is not sufficient.

5
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:17,630
Sometimes we have to do what
is called anonymization.

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,215
So, think about the example where
there was only one student with junior

7
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:21,980
standing.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,700
Although we dropped the student ID
that directly identified that student.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,470
But the standing field or
attribute will tell us,

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,400
even without the ID,
who that particular tuple is about.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,480
So one way to do that is you can
do some sort of anonymization.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,580
And one way to do anonymization
is what's called generalization.

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,140
So you replace an exact value
by a set of values or a range.

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,280
So, we may combine
junior-senior standing and

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,960
we can just say upperclassmen or
something like that.

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,720
And if you only have juniors and
seniors, then that would then avoid that

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,760
problem we had where the junior standing
identified a particular student.

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,270
So, even when you do
the de-identification and

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,430
anonymization it has
to be done with care.

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,795
Depending on your data set that you
have, or what's stored in the database,

21
00:01:10,795 --> 00:01:12,418
this may not be sufficient.

22
00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:17,143
Think of an example where we're looking
at people, with certain diseases,

23
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,043
who live in various zip codes.

24
00:01:19,043 --> 00:01:22,865
So, well someone may be able to make
some sort of an inference based on a zip

25
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:27,010
code and publicly available information,
addresses, and things like that.

26
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,023
So, we may want to drop the last
digit of the zip code, or

27
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,959
the last two digits of the zip code.

28
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,918
So that's one way to generalize it.

29
00:01:33,918 --> 00:01:37,334
Okay?
So, Georgia Tech is 30332.

30
00:01:37,334 --> 00:01:40,014
If we replace the last two by zero zero,

31
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:44,990
then perhaps the three digits we
have match with a much larger area.

32
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,684
But what if,
even after you do that generalization,

33
00:01:48,684 --> 00:01:53,199
the disease that we have is the same
across all those different zip

34
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:56,584
codes where the first
three digits are the same?

35
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:59,688
The disease values are not
diverse enough, let's say,

36
00:01:59,688 --> 00:02:01,630
if they're exactly the same.

37
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,420
Everybody has some sort of infectious
disease or something like that,

38
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,630
which CDC maybe looking at on how
those infections are spreading out and

39
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,380
stuff like that.

40
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,180
Generalization won't do anything
on that case, isn't it?

41
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,510
Because it's the same value C same
disease D for example that we didn't

42
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:24,150
want someone to see that this particular
zip code had incidence of that disease.

43
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,420
That's why we do the realization saying
well it could be any of the four or

44
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,037
eight or whatever number of zip codes
when you replace the last two digits by

45
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:32,580
zero zero.

46
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,560
But if the values,
the disease values are not diverse then

47
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,880
just generalizing or anonymizing
the zip code value doesn't go very far.

48
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,831
So in a generally,
either this transformation involves

49
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:45,970
de-identification, generalization,
anonymization.

50
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,330
There are things called k-anonymities so
they're at least multiple tuples and

51
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,650
you focus on certain subset of
the values that could be used as a quasi

52
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,800
identifier are the same in the database
And then we have to see that

53
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,070
across the same set of quasi-identifiers
that we have, they're multiple values,

54
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:08,070
so we can't say that given
an identifier that we have here, for

55
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,920
sure we know that this must
be the sensitive value.
