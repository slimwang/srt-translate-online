1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,672
So, in summary what we have done is we have taken a mechanism, that is

2
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:08,543
typically used in distributed systems, namely RPC, and

3
00:00:08,543 --> 00:00:10,992
we ask the question suppose we want to

4
00:00:10,992 --> 00:00:13,520
use RPC as a structuring mechanism in a

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,667
multiprocessor. How to make that efficient so that

6
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:21,062
the designers of services will in fact use

7
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:25,770
RPC as a vehicle. For building these services.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,620
And the reason why you want to promote that, is

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,170
because when you put every service in its own protection

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,150
domain you are building safety into the system. And that

11
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,160
is very important for the integrity of an operating system.

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,430
As an operating system designer, we worry about the integrity

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,590
of services and we can provide the integrity by putting

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,860
every service in its own protection domain. And we're making

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,000
RPC cheap enough that you would use as a structuring

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,360
mechanism we are promiting a, a software engineering practice

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,670
of building services in sep, in sepearate protection domains.
