00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,210
In this quiz you're going to practice
creating a text view object and

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,210
then call methods on it.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,930
Since this is just for practice,

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,250
we're going to do this in a new Android
app outside of the JustJava app.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,020
That way we don't mess
up the JustJava app.

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,070
Open up the project wizard in Android
Studio by going to File &gt; New Project.

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,650
Then you can accept the defaults for
all of these.

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,620
Make sure you have blank activity
template selected, then click Finish.

9
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,190
Once your project gets created go
ahead and run your app on your device.

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,220
The default behavior should be to see
the words Hello World show up here.

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,220
But now we're going to do
something a little different.

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,340
In the main activity class, we're
going to modify the on create method.

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,600
Instead of calling set content view
on this activity main XML layout,

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,080
we're going to create our own
text view and set that here.

15
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,960
On the Android Developers site,

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,010
there’s a Training section where it
talks about building your first app.

17
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,600
Specifically, I’m looking at the Display
the Message part of the tutorial.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,220
It tells you that in
the activity onCreate method,

19
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,930
we can create a TextView.

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,290
And here's the code we recognize
from earlier in this lesson.

21
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,850
We're creating a new TextView and

22
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,720
we're storing it in
a variable called textView.

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,708
This constructor requires
a context as an input parameter.

24
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:18,140
And passing (this) as
an input parameter,

25
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,780
because (this) refers to
the current activity.

26
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,450
And an activity is also a context,
so this so

27
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,530
this will correctly create
a TextView object for us.

28
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,610
Then we can call methods
on this TextView object.

29
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:35,330
Remember that this is a textView
variable name, not a TextView class.

30
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,360
That's why t is lower-case here.

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,430
We can call textView.setTextSize and
textView.setText as an example.

32
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,160
When you scroll down it says
to call setContentView and

33
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,890
pass in this textView
as an input parameter.

34
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,690
If you scroll down further
it actually shows you

35
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,230
a code sample of the onCreate method.

36
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,520
We don't need this part.

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,360
We're just focused on this part
where we're creating a textView and

38
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,160
then we're setting that as
the contentView of the activity layout.

39
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,610
Back in Android Studio in
the MainActivity class,

40
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,030
I'm going to modify the onCreate method.

41
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,394
I'm going to insert
some blank lines here.

42
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:12,065
First I'm going to create a new
TextView object using the constructor.

43
00:02:13,245 --> 00:02:15,535
I'm going to give it a variable
name of TextView, but

44
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:20,075
feel free to call it something else as
long as it's appropriately descriptive

45
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:21,075
of what this is.

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,870
The text you constructed
requires a context, so

47
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,100
I'm going to pass in this
to refer to this activity.

48
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,500
And then on the next line of code,

49
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,630
I'm going to call a method
on the textView object.

50
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,100
As soon as I hit dot, it's going to show
me all the possible methods that I could

51
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,730
call on this textView object.

52
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,340
If I start to type then it will filter
down these auto complete options.

53
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,720
You can see the options have narrowed.

54
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,230
I'm going to choose setText so I can
hit enter to use this auto complete.

55
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,370
Then I can put in a string
as an input argument.

56
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,230
And the last step is to change
the set content view line.

57
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,240
So instead of using this XML layout file
I'm going to just paste in textView.

58
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,810
I'm going to save this and
then run this on the device.

59
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,840
What I expect to happen now is that the
screen will show a new text view that

60
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,030
says Wow on it instead of hello world.

61
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,660
And it does.

62
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,860
It's a little underwhelming though.

63
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,390
So I want you to make it
a little more interesting.

64
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,198
I want you to call other methods,
on this textView object,

65
00:03:24,198 --> 00:03:27,254
like try to change the color,
or the text size.

66
00:03:27,254 --> 00:03:29,294
If you're even more adventurous,

67
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:32,780
you can try calling up other
methods on the textView object.

68
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,280
Look at the online documentation for
textView.

69
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,370
In order to figure out what
the other possible methods are.

70
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,490
When you're done,
check these boxes to continue.
