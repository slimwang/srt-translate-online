00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,630
Well, the EFF report actually
gives a lower score to Google.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,920
I think Google got three,
if I remember it right.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,570
But one of the reasons they
have a lower score, or

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,910
they lose a star,
is because they don't disclose it.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,190
So data retention policy
is not disclosed.

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,030
The answer to that is no.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,690
And the Google policy,
we didn't talk about it, and

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,040
in fact the policy doesn't.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,480
Not only did we not talk about it, the
policy does not address data retention.
