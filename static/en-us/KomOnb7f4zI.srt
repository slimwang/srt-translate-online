00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,326
Minor stimulants are things such as caffeine and energy drinks, whereas major

2
00:00:04,326 --> 00:00:09,560
stimulants are drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine. In general,

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,766
stimulants do what they word says. They stimulate. And they do so by activating

4
00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:17,781
the sympathetic nervous system. You remember, our fight-or-flight nervous

5
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:22,109
system. Now in general, all stimulants produce similar effects, but they do so

6
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,788
to a different degree. For example, caffeine will increase energy, but nowhere

7
00:00:26,788 --> 00:00:32,798
near the same level as cocaine or methamphetamine. The stimulants produce an

8
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:37,859
increase in energy, talkativeness, and motor behavior. In addition, they also

9
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,505
elevate mood and can produce feelings of power or confidence. In fact, it's

10
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:46,135
these powerful effects on feeling and mood that make the major stimulants such

11
00:00:46,135 --> 00:00:52,057
as cocaine and methamphetamine drugs of abuse. These stimulants produce their

12
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:55,576
reinforcing effectiveness by activating the nucleus accumbens and the dopamine

13
00:00:55,576 --> 00:01:00,024
reward pathway. Now it's important to remember that tolerance can develop to

14
00:01:00,024 --> 00:01:02,576
some of the drug's effects, and I'm going to send it back to Lauren to talk

15
00:01:02,576 --> 00:01:04,620
more about tolerance.
