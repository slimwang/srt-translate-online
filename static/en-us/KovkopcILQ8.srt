00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Now, one of the interesting things about customer development

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,630
that makes startups very different from large companies

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,230
is that customer development is done by the founders.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,730
Why the founders?

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,650
It turns out that there's a couple of interesting things,

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,220
and this is about human nature. There's no technology involved.

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,230
In a traditional startup in the old days, you would hire a VP of sales

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,880
who would go out because you were smart, this was your idea, and you'd say,

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,060
"Go try to sell this. Go talk to customers. I'll just hire somebody to do this."

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,040
But remember, an employee doesn't have the vision.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,610
They're just executing what you told them.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,250
And guess what happens if they go out and talk to people who say,

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,920
"This is the worst idea we ever heard," or "No, we won't buy it."

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,250
What happens is they'll come back and tell you in the first time they do this,

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,430
and you'll say, "Well, you're just not describing it right."

16
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,920
And you send them back out for another couple of days or weeks or months,

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,620
and they'll come back again.

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,650
And if you're like any passionate founder, you'll go, "I hired the wrong executive. You're fired."

19
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:04,209
Now just imagine we run the exercise this time not with a proxy head of sales or marketing,

20
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:08,470
but we force you to get out, you the founder to start talking to customers.

21
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,480
And if you got that same exact feedback, it might take you 3 customers

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,370
or 5 or 30, but eventually, smoke will start coming out of your ears

23
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,870
because cognitive dissonance is now coming into effect.

24
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:24,480
It's that you might realize that your story or vision isn't right.

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,080
But unlike a proxy, a VP of sales or marketing,

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,080
you have the power to change the company's strategy.

27
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,400
You have the power to change the entire value proposition, to say,

28
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,530
"What if we had these features?"

29
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,200
And customers might say, "Nah, nah, nah, still not."

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,760
But then if you said, "Well, what if we had this?" they might say,

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,260
"Oh, if you could do that, you could have my check right now."

32
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,800
If you're a smart founder you'd say, "Let me get right back to you,"

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,560
because what you'll do is you'll go test that new feature with 5 or 10 other customers.

34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,420
And all of a sudden you realize that you had the wrong feature set

35
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,090
and just by adding this small, little change,

36
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,920
you can now actually get a whole series of paying customers.

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,160
Only founders could do that.

38
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,400
And what we did in the past is we would wait till first customer ship,

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,280
we'd wait till sales didn't match the revenue plan,

40
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,050
and we'd actually make these changes by firing executives

41
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,540
instead of actually having the founders engage in Day 1.

42
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,540
So it's the founder who could change the product, make pivots,

43
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,790
and hear customer feedback firsthand.

44
00:02:25,790 --> 99:59:59,999
And that's the idea of getting the founder outside the building.
