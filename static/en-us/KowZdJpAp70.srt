Here's the simplified expression. Great work if you got it correct. We can

2
00:00:04,593 --> 00:00:08,993
divide 10 and 15 by 5, so I get 2 3rds in the front. Then I notice that I'll

3
00:00:08,993 --> 00:00:13,339
have 3 more g's in my numerator than in my denominator. So g cubed in the

4
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:17,919
numerator. Finally, I'll have 3 more h's in my denominator than I would in my

5
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:22,746
numerator. So I'll have an h cubed, or h to the 3rd, down below. But remember I

6
00:00:22,746 --> 00:00:27,369
said there's always more than one way to think about this. We can simplify our

7
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:32,078
fraction in the front, just like from before, so we'll have 2 3rds. Then we'll

8
00:00:32,078 --> 00:00:36,503
have g to the 7 minus 4 here, we follow that with h to the 5 minus 8, 7 minus 4

9
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:41,114
makes 3, and 5 minus 8 is negative 3. G to the 3rd, has a positive exponent, so

10
00:00:41,114 --> 00:00:45,633
we make sure we list it in the numerator. H to the negative 3 has a negative

11
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:50,232
exponent, so we know that moves to the denominator, and we change the sign to

12
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:55,139
make it positive. Think about the two ways to do this problem, and choose the

13
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:56,724
best that works for you.
