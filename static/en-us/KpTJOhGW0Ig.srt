[Evans] The answer is the cost per bit for a hard drive

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
is approximately 0.01 nanodollars per bit.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Remember a nanodollar is a billionth of a dollar,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so this is a cent of a billionth of a dollar per bit.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The latency distance, though, is quite high.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's 2098 kilometers.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So that means accessing data from the hard drive

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
is like traveling between Munich and Moscow.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This is a pretty big difference between accessing data from the DRAM memory,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
which is only about 3 meters away, about what you can reach with your arms,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
which is again very different from accessing data from the CPU,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
which is the distance between your thumb and your finger.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So when people write programs and they care about performance,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
you really have to think about memory quite a bit.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You have to make sure that the data that you access frequently

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
is stored in these close, fast-to-reach places,

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
not in the hard drive, which is like traveling between Munich and Moscow

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
to get to your data.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And no one is storing data in light bulbs.
