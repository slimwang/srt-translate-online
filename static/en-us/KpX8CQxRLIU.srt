1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,280
Social learning is a learning theory
that puts very explicit emphasis on

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,280
the interaction and collaboration among
people during the learning process.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,558
It was derived from Albert Bandura's
work and just like Jean Piaget

4
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:15,355
suggested, that authentic experiences
are really important for developing

5
00:00:15,355 --> 00:00:19,096
a real understanding, or constructing
a real understanding of some topic,

6
00:00:19,096 --> 00:00:22,663
Bandura suggested that part of that
authenticity is the authentic social

7
00:00:22,663 --> 00:00:24,879
interactions that
happen during learning.

8
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:26,243
That we learn together and

9
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:29,282
we develop our concepts of
different material together.

10
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:33,019
And it's really important to preserve
that in any learning environment, but

11
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:35,460
this presents a real problem for
online learning.

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,360
Because in online learning,
we lose the most accessible device for

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,930
facilitating this kind
of social learning.

14
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,570
And that's the physical classroom.

15
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,800
In a physical classroom we can
actually talk to one another,

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,320
interact face to face.

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,470
Online we don't have that as much.

18
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,860
So how do we develop that for
the online environment?

19
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,220
So this really brings up two questions.

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,160
First of all, how does the loss
of that physical environment,

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,810
that physical classroom
impact online learning?

22
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,350
How does it change what students learn?

23
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,270
Does it actually hurt us?

24
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,584
And secondly, how do we develop devices,
develop technologies,

25
00:01:06,584 --> 00:01:08,515
that can actually resolve this issue.

26
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:11,689
Assuming that it does damage the
learning if we don't have access to this

27
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:14,200
kind of interpersonal collaboration and
interaction?

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,379
Can we develop devices that
actually help alleviate that,

29
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:19,740
that facilitate that interaction online?

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,916
Now I'm obviously very biased,
because I work on this program and

31
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:23,946
I love this program.

32
00:01:23,946 --> 00:01:25,949
I think that with technology,

33
00:01:25,949 --> 00:01:30,280
not only can we develop ways
to overcome this difficulty.

34
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,730
Honestly, I think in
the online environment,

35
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,980
we can develop technologies
that make it even better.

36
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,900
One of my favorite experiences in
this program has been that, I can

37
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,170
logon to the class forum and interact
with ten students in five minutes.

38
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,237
And then come back an hour later and
do it again.

39
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:44,977
And that's a level of interaction,

40
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:48,465
a level of collaboration that I could
never have in a physical classroom.

41
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:52,042
And so, I really think that with
the right effort and the right designs,

42
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:54,975
we can create and leverage
social learning in a way online,

43
00:01:54,975 --> 00:01:57,520
that actually goes beyond
what we can do in person.
