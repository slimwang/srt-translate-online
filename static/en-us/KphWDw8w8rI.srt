1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,830
So we have our object diagram started,
and

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,950
right now these objects
are just floating around.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,580
We haven't really talked about
how they might be interconnected.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,220
So let's add some connections, or if
we're going to use the more formal term,

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,590
we'll say let's add some relationships.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,400
Relationships that we're going to add
are going to be ones that we've borrowed

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,530
from UML.

8
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:23,180
Those are the contains relationship, and
the kind of, or kind of relationship.

9
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,230
And these are also known by other names,
for

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,060
instance contains might
be known as part of,

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,689
kind of might also be known as a type
of, and there's other variations too.

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,220
So what do these mean?

13
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,640
Let's start with
the contains relationship.

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,610
Like it sounds, a contains relationship
is representative of when an object

15
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,960
contains another object.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,790
If we think about the world object, it
contains a robot, it contains an alien.

17
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,550
There's a background.

18
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,800
It also has a dialogue bubble and
the badge here,

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,240
but we're going to leave those out for
now.

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,920
So in our diagram, let's create some
relationships between the world and

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,580
the robot, the alien,
and the background.

22
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,370
So I'm going to go ahead and

23
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,810
move some things around just
to make some extra space.

24
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,730
And to represent
the contains relationship,

25
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,450
we'll draw arrows from the world object
to the objects that it contains, and

26
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,070
label them as contains relationships.

27
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,310
Pay close attention to
the direction of the arrows.

28
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,930
For these relationships, it's
pointing from the world to the robot,

29
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,480
to the alien, and to the background.

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,380
And the reason that it points in
this direction is it allows us to

31
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,980
read the relationship by
just following the arrow.

32
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,580
Now we could also say
that the app contains

33
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,480
each of the objects in this diagram,
but if I'm going to add an arrow for

34
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,630
every single object in our diagram,
it could get a little hard to follow.

35
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,940
To keep our diagram simple we just
want to add the contains relationships

36
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,600
from the app to the most
high level objects.

37
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,500
By high level, I mean objects that are
bigger in the sense that they have more

38
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,380
complexity about them.

39
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,640
For instance, the world object is at
a higher level than the alien object

40
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,520
in a sense that it probably has more
functionality contained within it.

41
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,730
Another way to think about it is that
the world probably plays a bigger role

42
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,620
as part of the app than the alien does.

43
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,850
In general you want to keep this going
from the most high level object,

44
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,940
like in this case the Alien Adventure,
to the lower level objects.

45
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,000
So, for instance,
an Alien Adventure contains a world,

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,770
a world contains a robot,
robot can contain a badge, and

47
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,100
we can add a relationship for
that later.

48
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,025
Now, the distinctions that
we're making here and

49
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:35,030
these relationships that we're adding,
again they're completely up to you.

50
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,340
Where I'm using a contains relationship
between the world and the alien,

51
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,410
you might use something else, or might
not even have a relationship at all or

52
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:49,070
where I'm labeling this as a contains
relationship I might not even have that.

53
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,417
I might even remove alien adventure
because the world is kind of the most

54
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:54,670
[INAUDIBLE] object.

55
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,170
By the title here we know that we're
talking about the alien adventure app.

56
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,020
But again,
it's just personal preference.

57
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,140
You can do whatever you want to.

58
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,100
So moving on,
let's talk about the other relationship.

59
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,220
The kind of relationship.

60
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,890
This is one of my favorites.

61
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,210
It used to describe objects
that have similarities and

62
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,450
it also involves a little
bit of abstract thinking.

63
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,690
For instance, let's think
about the alien and the robot.

64
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,740
They’re actually pretty similar.

65
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,920
The robot and the alien can animate.

66
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,140
We saw that the robot could move
across the screen and the alien's

67
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,030
animating right now and they’re
both able to speak to each other,

68
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,180
so in a sense they’re a little
bit like actors in a play.

69
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,680
Now this is the abstract part.

70
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,140
The aliens and
the robot are like actors in a play.

71
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,760
Then why not add an object to our
diagram that represents an actor.

72
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,080
I mean that sounds pretty good to me.

73
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,330
An actor is an object
that can be animated and

74
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,300
participates in discussions.

75
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,450
And just like we said, both the alien
and the robot are kinds of actors.

76
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,970
And that's how we'll add
this kind of relationship.

77
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,890
We'll start by adding
an actor to the diagram.

78
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,970
And then we'll add relationships
from the alien to the actor.

79
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,730
Because an alien is a kind of actor and

80
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,760
from the robot to the actor because
the robot is a kind of actor.

81
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,880
And I hope you've noticed that for

82
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,140
these kind of relationships,
the direction of the arrows again.

83
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,290
We're going from the alien to the actor,
so it reads very naturally and

84
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,760
alien is a kind of actor.

85
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,970
And we can take this one step further.

86
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,740
We can simplify our diagram and
say that the world contains actors,

87
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,260
and then get rid of the arrows that we
have from the world to the robot, and

88
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,260
from the world to the alien.

89
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,430
So I'll give you just
a second to let that soak in.

90
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,060
The world contains actors, and
the actors can be robots or aliens.

91
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,850
And the world also
contains a background, or

92
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,900
that's what we have so far.
