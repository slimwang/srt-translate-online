00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,389
The Carter Center in
Atlanta is famous for

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,220
monitoring elections to
make sure they are fair.

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:09,320
This year, they decide to have their
interns practice on local elections.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,750
Sally, a Georgia Tech
computer scientist,

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,359
turned activist, needs to visit these
three polling stations on election day.

6
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,620
The night before,

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,130
she plans to stay at a hotel close
to one of the polling stations.

8
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:23,669
After checking the voting
machines at the first station,

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,300
she will visit each of
the other two in turn.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,100
Sally is on her bicycle, so she wants
to minimize her travel distance, and

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,429
she is willing to go the wrong way
down one way streets to do it.

12
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:36,619
Fortunately, Sally took
the artificial intelligence course, so

13
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,519
she knows how to write a program
that tells her where to start and

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,080
the optimal streets to use to
get to each polling station.

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,539
Proud of being a nerd,

16
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:48,420
Sally wrote her program such that it had
minimal runtime and memory overhead.

17
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,640
How did she do it?

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,570
Choose the best answer.

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,780
Remember, these challenge questions
are designed to give a preview of

20
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,109
the lesson to come.

21
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:59,140
We do not expect you to know
how to do the answer yet.
