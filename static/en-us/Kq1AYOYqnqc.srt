1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,220
So this is our continuing solution for

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:08,010
this multipart quiz. We have begun issuing instruction MUL 4,

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,360
so the question is now, what goes into the fields of the reservation station?

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,610
And also, which RAT entries going to modified? The modification of the RAT entry

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,780
is going to be easy because it's going to be the RAT entry for R1. So

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,060
the correct answer here is R1. The RAT entry for R1 is going to be modified, and

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,115
we modified with ROB4. Before we do that,

8
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:34,775
however, we need to read out what is the RAT content for R1 and R2.

9
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:40,358
And we find that it's ROB2 and ROB1. So, the answer here is going to be that,

10
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:46,844
this reservation station entry for the multiplication is going to have two tags,

11
00:00:46,844 --> 00:00:52,420
for R1, ROB2, for R2, ROB1. And it's not going to have either of the values.

12
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,730
We would only put something here if we could actually get their actual value

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,920
from wherever it is. But because we need to wait for ROB2 to get the value and

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,239
we need to wait for ROB1 to get that value, which simply leave these empty.

15
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,190
So that concludes the correct answering for this part of the quiz.
