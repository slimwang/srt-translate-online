>> This time we have to worry about both variables and coefficients. If we look

2
00:00:04,518 --> 00:00:08,910
at the coefficient in each terms, they have a common factor of 6, so we know

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,374
that we have to pull that out of our expression, but there's also an x in both

4
00:00:13,374 --> 00:00:18,029
12xy and in 18x squared. So that is a fact that needs to comes out as well. So

5
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:24,351
the full common factor that 12xy and 18x squared share is 6x. I mean, you divide

6
00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:27,396
each term by that, you get 2y and 3x.
