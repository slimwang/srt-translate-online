When I work with data-bind in Knockout, I often get it a little bit wrong, and

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,440
sometimes it feels discouraging.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,483
So, if that happened to you during this exercise, it's not you.

4
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:11,320
It comes with the territory.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,030
And the best programmers can keep their chin up and

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,920
keep working at it despite things breaking.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,660
Also, your solution may look different from mine.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,300
That's also okay.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,260
There are many ways of doing this.

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,800
So, look at my solution more for inspiration rather than for the right answer.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,505
That said, here's my solution.

12
00:00:30,505 --> 00:00:34,860
First, I added an observable array in my ViewModel.

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,630
I also chose some of the cutest nicknames ever, Tabitha Tab Tabby Catty Cat.

14
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:45,120
Now, in the HTML, as you can see, I've added a div down here for our nicknames,

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,040
an h3 to make it look pretty, and I made a ul with a foreach binding.

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,370
This will take this li and do it again and

17
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,180
again and again for each of the nicknames.

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,670
And these li's have a text binding of $data.

19
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,260
Now, I used $data because I had to get to the actual data in the array that

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,270
we're looping over.

21
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,160
Now, this is great for simple things like nicknames or months or

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,000
lottery numbers where the data is super simple, just a string or

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,500
a number or Boolean for that matter.

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,080
Now, if you filled your observable array with objects on the other hand,

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,540
you would write the name of the property that you wanted out of the object.

26
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,300
This is great when you're looping over objects that are a bit more complicated,

27
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,540
maybe objects that represent people or products.

28
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,860
But in this case, it's just a bunch of strings.
