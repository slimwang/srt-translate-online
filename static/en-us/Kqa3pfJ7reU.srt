00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,015
This is actually a little bit tricky. Even
though we've talked a lot about what

2
00:00:05,027 --> 00:00:10,218
vocabulary is, sometimes it's hard to
apply it to actual situations. Let's start

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,999
from the bottom and work up. -100000 is
part of a term, but the term that it's

4
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:20,293
part of is actually -100,000x. Remember
that the term is the whole thing that's

5
00:00:20,305 --> 00:00:25,980
going to be added to other things or
subtracted from other things. So -100000

6
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:31,850
on its own is not a term, so let's cross
that out. We said earlier that -100,000x

7
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:37,255
is a variable term as a whole, but it's
not the -100000 that makes the term a

8
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:43,121
variable term. It's the x that does that,
so, -100,000 itself is not a variable.

9
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:47,675
Constant was the word that we used for
numbers that were terms on their own,

10
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:52,656
things like 3 million right here. This is
something that is a term by itself that

11
00:00:52,668 --> 00:00:57,595
has no variables as part of it. -100,000
is not standing on its own, it's

12
00:00:57,607 --> 00:01:02,945
multiplied by x, so this is not a constant
either. That leaves us with coefficient.

13
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:07,460
Remember that coefficients are the number
parts of variable terms. So they are

14
00:01:07,472 --> 00:01:12,035
numbers that are multiplied by variables
to create variable terms. I know there are

15
00:01:12,047 --> 00:01:16,275
a lot of subtle differences involved in
this, but over time this will become a

16
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:19,695
much more natural feeling. Great job
working on all this vocab.
