00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,800
Talk about another perspective, in
terms of what the good guys have to do.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,250
First of all, we have to worry
about what we call prevention.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,350
Prevention really is keeping
the bad guys out of our systems.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,201
The bad guys are the threat sources,

5
00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:16,720
they're going to try
to attack our system.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,650
If we can keep them out,
that is prevention.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,250
Unfortunately, prevention
is not going to be 100%.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:28,230
If that happens, we want to detect
the compromise as quickly as possible.

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,130
People talk about advanced persistent
threats, APTs that go undetected for

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,010
a long time.

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,268
That means we don't have good systems to
detect that kind of malicious activity.

12
00:00:38,268 --> 00:00:41,140
Well, if we find out that they
have breached our systems or

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,920
compromised them,
then we have to respond to that.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,110
So response comes next, and what do we
need to do as part of the response?

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,110
We need to recover from
whatever that has happened.

16
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,300
If data was corrupted, maybe we have
to restore it and things like that.

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,980
And then remediation basically has to be

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,100
that the same attack
should not happen again.

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,343
All these things is what good guys have
to do so there are really two parts.

20
00:01:06,343 --> 00:01:07,770
Sort of, how do you do that?

21
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,490
How do you do detection?

22
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,110
How do you do remediation?

23
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,170
And what exactly needs to be done?

24
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,780
So mechanism is sort of the how part.

25
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,110
You want to have a flexible
set of mechanisms.

26
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,320
So policy is always what is the way in
which we're going to address something

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,680
and what's done is through
this whole spectrum.

28
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,590
Cyber security, again, you're not
going to be 100% secure ever but

29
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,520
that doesn't mean that we
leave the door wide open, so

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,960
that's what good guys have to do.
