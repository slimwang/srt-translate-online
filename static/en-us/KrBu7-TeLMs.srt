For this equation, x would equal 3 halves. Great thinking if you found this

2
00:00:05,061 --> 00:00:10,997
fraction. Now we want to start by rewriting these with the same base. So I know

3
00:00:10,997 --> 00:00:16,970
9 is 3 squared. And I know 27 is 3 cubed. We have a power raised to a power, so

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:22,757
I'll multiply these two exponents to get 3 to the 2 x equal to 3 cubed. Now

5
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:27,889
that our bases are identical, then we can set these exponents equal. So we'll

6
00:00:27,889 --> 00:00:33,760
have 2x equal to 3. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we'll have x is

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,600
equal to 3 halves, or 1 and a half.
