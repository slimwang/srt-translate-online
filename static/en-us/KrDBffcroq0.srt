1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,950
So I'm going to first describe to you a

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:08,080
more scalable version of the sense reversal algorithm.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,630
And the basic idea is to use divide

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,280
and conquer. I have a hierarchical solution. That

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,340
is, limit the amount of sharing to a

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,150
small number of processes. Let's say a small

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:26,310
number K of processes and, and in this example, k is equal to 2. So essentially,

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,510
you know, what we are saying is, if you have n processors that the condition,

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,760
break them up into small groups of

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,160
k processors. And so we build the hierarchical

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,490
solution and the hierarchical solution obviously leads

12
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,290
to a tree solution. And so, since we

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,220
have K processors competing and accomplishing a

14
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,150
variable among themselves. If you have N processors,

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:57,870
then you have a log, and the base K as a number of levels in the tree, in order

16
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,150
to achieve the value. And in this case, what

17
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,570
we have done is K is equal to 2. And

18
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,430
so, the number of levels and with the eight

19
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,350
processors The number of levels in the tree is going to

20
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,020
be three. So let's talk about what happens when

21
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,240
we [UNKNOWN] a value. So, at a micro level algorithm

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,530
works exactly like a sense reversing algorithm. And

23
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,620
that is, these two processes if they're sharing this

24
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,240
data structure at count Variable and a locksense variable

25
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,980
and you see that for every k processes and

26
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,010
in this case k being two, every two

27
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,860
processes you have issued two shared variables: account variable

28
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,030
and a locksense variable. Count variable locksense variable, count

29
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,090
and locksense. And, so what's going to happen and

30
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,930
you'll see that you have this count and locksense variable.

31
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,600
Replicated in every level of the tree, and we'll talk

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,590
about how these going to, are, variables are going to be used

33
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,610
in the progression of this algorithm. So let's first talk

34
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,830
about arriving at a barrier. So let's say that P1

35
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,170
has arrived at the barrier. What it is going to do

36
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,440
is, it's going to go and decrement this counter. Now, what

37
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,880
is this counter going to be set to? Well, This counter is,

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,160
is just for the key processes that are value

39
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,730
syncing here and keeping two this counter is going

40
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,580
to be two. And so, this guy is going to

41
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,750
decrement the count and if the count is not zero

42
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,110
it's going to basically wait for the sense to reverse.

43
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,240
Just like the sense reversal of algorithms. The same thing

44
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,690
is going to happen that P1 comes here decrements the

45
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,010
count and it waits for sense to reverse by spinning

46
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:38,740
on this flag. Sometime later, P0 comes to the barrier and

47
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,010
it decrements the count, count goes to zero, but you're not

48
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,340
done with the barrier yet, because the barrier is for all

49
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,360
of the processes. So what P0 is going to say is okay,

50
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,940
between the two of us I know that we both have

51
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,320
reached the value because the count is zero. But I have

52
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,810
to go up, and go to the next level up and

53
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,240
here I'm going to decrement the count here, to indicate that I've arrived

54
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,890
at the value. So P0's the one that arrive up

55
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,690
the tree, P1 is stuck here waiting for sense to diverse,

56
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,090
P0 moves up. So remember that even though P0's come here

57
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,880
decremented the count and made it zero, that doesn't flip the

58
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,900
sense flag yet. Right? Because the value will be done

59
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,440
only when everybody has arrived, and therefore all that P0 is

60
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,210
going to do now is decrement the count, see that it is

61
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,830
0, then it is going to move up in the tree and

62
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,700
go to the next level of the tree. And this

63
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,740
data structure, which is now shared among this half of

64
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,370
the tree this half of the tree is sharing this

65
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,310
data structure, so P0 decrements this count. And what'll this count

66
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,170
be resized to? Again, 2, right? Because at every level,

67
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,770
you have k processors, k being 2 in this case, arriving

68
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,900
at a barrier. So P0 arrives here, decrements the count,

69
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,845
count is not 0 yet, and so it waits. So P0

70
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:52,440
is going to wait on locksense to reverse here. P1 is waiting

71
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,390
on locksense deliveries here P0 is not waiting on locksense deliveries

72
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,990
here because it has arrived at the barrier but his partners

73
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,520
are still stragglers, they have not arrived at the barrier yet.
