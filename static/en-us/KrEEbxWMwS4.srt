1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,070
So the first step was made really easy.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,240
All you need to do is
uncomment these lines here.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,040
For the second step, I had to change
the user profile creation code so

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,930
that user.nickname is used for the
display name and user.email is used for

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,760
the main email value and that's it.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,810
If you set up the web client ID
correctly and configured the consent

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,230
screen correctly, you should now be
able to log in to your app on appspot.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,030
If instead of getting a consent screen
here, you're getting an error message or

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,790
forbidden error, check to make sure
you've entered the URL correctly and

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,450
that the email and project name
are set in the consent screen.

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,440
You can also check the instructor
notes for some help.
