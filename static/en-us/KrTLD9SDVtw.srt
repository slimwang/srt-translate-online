Hello. Welcome to our unit on inheritance. Also known as, what not to do when

2
00:00:04,283 --> 00:00:08,074
you are chased by a bear. So, recall the question we ended the last unit with,

3
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:11,448
which is what was up with these magic methods? And we saw two of them, init and

4
00:00:11,448 --> 00:00:14,628
str, when they're missing, when we didn't define them in the class. It seemed

5
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:17,380
like they were still there. That would make them pretty magical. They're not

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,466
really that magical. So, let me show you what's going on. So, let me show you

7
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:24,216
that they're actually there. So, we're going to define a totally empty class. No

8
00:00:24,216 --> 00:00:28,595
attributes, no definitions at all. And I'm going to create an instance of that

9
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:33,480
class. And we saw that, that instance has an str attribute and it's a method.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,217
And we can invoke that str method and we get the string. Not a very interesting

11
00:00:37,217 --> 00:00:40,490
one, but we do get a string back. And we can see using dir, which is an

12
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,270
operation that takes any object and gives us a list of attributes to find for

13
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,203
that object. That's there's actually a whole bunch of attributes to find for

14
00:00:48,203 --> 00:00:51,965
this empty class already. And we see that these include the str attribute, which

15
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:55,398
turns it into a string, as well as the init attribute, which initializes it.

16
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:59,776
What's going on here is what we call inheritance, which is a way to reuse

17
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:04,040
definitions from other classes when we define new classes. We'll get to

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,560
inheritance soon, as well as, the mystery of where these extra magic methods

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,086
came from. Before getting to inheritance, I want to cover three other aspects of

20
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:14,362
Python that you may not have seen before, that we haven't yet covered in this

21
00:01:14,362 --> 00:01:18,380
class. That's format strings, named arguments, and default parameters. If you

22
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,630
already feel comfortable with those things, feel free to skip ahead to where I

23
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,083
start talking about inheritance.
