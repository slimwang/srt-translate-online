00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,600
What if we wanted to find the median number of friends using this spreadsheet?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,994
Remember, that first we want to order the date. So, there's a very useful tool

3
00:00:08,994 --> 00:00:13,624
called Sort which is in pretty much all spreadsheet software. In Google

4
00:00:13,624 --> 00:00:19,400
spreadsheets, the way you do it is by first highlighting the data. And I'm

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,440
going to show you a keyboard shortcut really quick. From cell A2, hit Shift and

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:30,538
then Right arrow key, so it highlights cell A2 and B2. And then, Command,

7
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:36,138
Shift, Down arrow key. And then, this highlights all the data. It's easier to

8
00:00:36,138 --> 00:00:39,290
do it this way than by simply dragging your cursor all the way down to the

9
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,460
bottom. This is just a quick and easy way to highlight all the data. So now,

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,425
click on Data, and we want to sort by column B because that's the data we're

11
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:54,140
interested in. We're not really interested in the time stamp. So we'll click

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,180
Sort Range, and then we should get a box here saying, Sort Range By, and we'll

13
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:06,180
say column B. And in general, we want to sort from least to greatest. So, I'm

14
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,491
going to stop here and let you try and experiment with this. And then after you

15
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:15,180
sort the data in the spreadsheet, try finding the median
