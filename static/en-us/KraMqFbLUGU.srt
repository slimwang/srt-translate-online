1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,180
The word test may bring
back memories of school.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,159
I remember staying up much too late
the night before a final exam,

3
00:00:06,159 --> 00:00:08,970
trying to cram in as much
information as I could.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,690
These were stressful high pressure
situations because I wanted to

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,950
perform well.

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,670
There was a lot riding on the results.

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,660
Namely passing the class.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,590
In these situations, I sometimes felt
as if the teacher was testing me.

9
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,470
But here's a different
way to think about it.

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,520
What if the teacher was
actually testing themselves.

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,110
I'll come back to this example
in a moment, but first,

12
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,140
let's discuss another kind of test.

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,900
A test that cannot be passed because
the test only gives results when

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,730
the subject fails.
