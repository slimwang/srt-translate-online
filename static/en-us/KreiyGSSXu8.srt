1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,900
So ACTION_DETAIL is the action for when
a user views the details of a product,

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,610
so that's basically anytime they
go to the view product page,

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,100
or they select the product in a list.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,150
And you're going to be doing that
with the dinners in a minute.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,510
When the user purchases the product,

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,330
the action is somewhat
unsurprisingly ACTION_PURCHASE.

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:28,700
When the user removes the product from
the cart, the action is ACTION_REMOVE.

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,500
Okay, I'm guessing this is
going to be ACTION_CHECKOUT.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,680
And in fact, it is.

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,610
So all of these, I think,
are very intuitive.

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,380
The one that's perhaps not quite so
obvious is ACTION_DETAIL, which is

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,470
basically what you use whenever a user
views the product or views the details.

13
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,566
So maybe it should be ACTION_VIEW.

14
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:53,640
But, no, it's not, it's ACTION_DETAIL.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,130
I just need to remind you that
these actions are purely for

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,992
information to send to Analytics.

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,239
You'll still need to write the code
to actually add the product to

18
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,160
the cart, etc.
