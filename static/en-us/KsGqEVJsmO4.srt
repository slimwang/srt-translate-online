1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, here's my answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It centers around this SQL statement.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Select * from links where submitter_id = 62443

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and votes > 1000.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Those are the constraints of the question.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I make a link just as we've done previously.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I use the fetchone function, and then I return that first link's ID.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's give this a run, and we see that the answer is 15,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
which is the correct answer.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now, if you didn't remember that submitter_id is the

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is the column name for the user's ID,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
you could have found it in a couple of places.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
One, you could have looked at the SQL here for creating the table,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and you can see it's called submitter_id.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Or you could have gone up here to the definition of the link class

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and guessed that I would have used the same property.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But that's the answer.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay, let's get a little fancier with our SQL here.
