00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,230
The third kind of UML relationship that we have to

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,330
deal with during design is how are you going to implement dependencies.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,940
Dependencies are at once both the most common and

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,050
the most varied kind of relationship.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,180
Having a dependency between two classes merely means that

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,450
one class somehow uses the other.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,680
This relationship can be implemented in a variety of ways.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,720
Most simply you can have an attribute or

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,900
a global object having the type of the target class.

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,300
You could receive arguments of the target class in one of your methods.

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,100
You could make a method or construct your call to the target.

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,370
Or you could import the target as either directly or

13
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,720
as part of a, a, a package into your class.

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,580
All of those are examples of how you're using the target in your

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,780
particular implementation.
