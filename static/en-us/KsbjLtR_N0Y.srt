1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,950
So, now,
let's look at these steps one at a time.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,040
Let's first look at the prediction step.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,870
Okay?

4
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:11,120
So our prediction step is, given some

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,840
belief about X of, at t minus one,
and given the measurements

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,270
all the way up through t minus one,
make a prediction of Xt.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:26,400
State of time t, still given only the
measurements through time t minus one.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,470
The way we do that and

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,990
I'm, It's going to be written out
here in, in sort of a standard way.

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,770
And then we're going to make
specific use of that both,

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,370
especially in particle filtering
which we'll do in a little bit.

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,570
What, the way you would do
that is what's known as,

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,610
you use the law of total probability and
marginalization, allright?

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,880
So the law of total
probability marginalization,

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,340
I'm only supposed to
be reminding you here,

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,750
you're supposed to remember all
your probability theory, right?

17
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,420
Then if I've got a joint density,
right, P of a and b.

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,250
If I integrate that over all the b's

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,270
what I'm left with is
the density over a.

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,270
Allright.

21
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,220
That's marginalization.

22
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,364
So what I'm going to do here is the idea
is well if I had a joint density of

23
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:13,710
xt minus one,index t and I were to
integrate over all the xt minus ones,

24
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,880
I would just have the density over xt,
so that's the marginalization.

25
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,790
And, the reason we do
that is we can then

26
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,560
break that integral up
into the following, right?

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,580
So, you might remember the conditioning,
right, probability of A and

28
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,420
B is the probability of A given B
times the probability of B, it's

29
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,120
what it says down here, so I've just
broken up this integral down into this.

30
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,040
Where here's the probability of xt minus
one given everything up to t minus one.

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,326
And I multiple that times the
probability of xt given xt minus one and

32
00:01:48,326 --> 00:01:50,090
everything else.

33
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,710
So I'm just applying the conditioning
property to that interval.

34
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,965
And then I can use that independence
assumption that we said before.

35
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:04,730
Remember, the independence assumption Is
that if I want the probability of xt,

36
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,320
and I'm given the previous state, and

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,220
a bunch of other things,
those other things don't matter.

38
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,060
The only thing that matters
is that previous state.

39
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,720
That's our dynamics model.

40
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,690
So, basically, we have two things here.

41
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,800
We have our belief.

42
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,990
About t minus onr,

43
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,560
giving everything up through t minus
one and then we have our dynamics.

44
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,840
Those are the two components that
it takes in order to make that

45
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,870
guess going forward.
