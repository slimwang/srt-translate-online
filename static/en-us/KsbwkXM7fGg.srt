00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,034
This question is something of a test of your vocabulary. Shading refers to per

2
00:00:04,034 --> 00:00:09,233
vertex versus per pixel. With Gouraud being per vertex and Phong being per

3
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:13,354
pixel. We're given the per pixel will be considerably more costly than per

4
00:00:13,354 --> 00:00:17,680
vertex. So this side of the grid will be more expensive. Illumination refers to

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,370
the Lambertian diffuse model versus the Blinn Phong specular model. Since the

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:27,060
Blinn-Phong model builds on the Lambertian model, adding shininess, it must be

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,250
more costly. So the top part of this grid will be more expensive. These two

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,270
facts establish that Gourand and Lambert is the quickest and Phong shading with

9
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,152
Blinn-Phong illumination is the most expensive. The tie break between these

10
00:00:39,152 --> 00:00:42,716
other two combinations is that per pixel shading is given to be much more costly

11
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:46,349
than vertex shading. This tips the balance so that Gouraud shading and

12
00:00:46,349 --> 00:00:50,189
Blinn-Phong illumination is faster than Phong Shading and Lambertian

13
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:51,050
Illumination.
