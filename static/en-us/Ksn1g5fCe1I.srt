1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:06,440
Now this is the way to write, in general, a result of a supervised learner.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,110
On the left side is our target variable, the one you are trying to predict,

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,900
often called the output.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,470
And on the right side, age, is our input variable.

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:23,050
Two other words here, this fact over here, 6.25 is also called the slope.

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,670
And this number over here, which happens to be zero, is called the intercept.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,730
Since they define how steep this curve goes up, 6.25.

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,310
And where this, of course, intercepts the vertical axis over here.

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:39,030
Let's see if it can help us understand slope and intercept in the next quiz.
