1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,100
So if you look at the redo log, it has

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,290
a transaction header, and in between the transaction header and

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,580
end mark are all the changes that have been made

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,740
in that particular critical section by the developer. And for

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,910
each of the address changed within that critical section, what

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,420
is the new data that corresponds to the changes that

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,120
have been made to that page? Similarly what is the

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,030
new data for this range, new data for this range.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,490
That's the structure of this redo log record that

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,220
has been created and forced to the disk. Now,

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,260
when we resume from the crash, what we need

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,020
to do is make sure that the external data

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,760
segments Are updated with all the changes that have

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,270
been made and recorded in the redo log but

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,060
have not yet been applied to the external data

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,460
segments. So crash recovery is of course the whole reason

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,860
for LRVM. And what we're going to do when we resume from crash is read the

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,760
redo log starting from the tail Of the

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,200
entire log segment, and that's where the reverse

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,730
displacements come into play. And once you've read

21
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,890
the log from the disk, apply to the

22
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,090
external data segments where it has to go

23
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,270
to. All of that information is contained in

24
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,710
the redo log record in terms of the

25
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,940
transaction. What is the address range that is being

26
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,700
modified? What is the external data segment that

27
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,550
particular address range corresponds to? All that information is

28
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,440
contained in the redo log record. So you

29
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,880
can take that and apply to the external data

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,570
segment. And once you've done that, you can throw

31
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,400
away the log. So that's how Crash Recovery works.
