00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,716
To give you an idea of how common this interface is, strings are already

2
00:00:04,716 --> 00:00:10,700
comparable. You can check whether a class implements comparable by looking at

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:16,091
its documentation. Under all implemented interfaces, you can see that

4
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:21,687
comparable is listed. Just to get you thinking, what will this method called

5
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:27,372
return Badminton.compareTo Football. Will it return minus 4, 4, 0, true, or

6
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:32,048
false? Think about the natural order of strings. And if you're not sure you can

00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:36,057
try it in bluejay. I haven't totally explained to you how to do this question,

8
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:38,474
but just go with your gut.
