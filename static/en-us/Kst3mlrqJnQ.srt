00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,740
So now that you have a glimpse about what PCA does, let's do PCA by hand,

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,370
and I'm going to kind of make up

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,560
an example here that hopefully makes sense to you once you do it.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,874
So we've kind of made data that lies between the coordinates 1,2,

5
00:00:15,874 --> 00:00:20,570
somewhere uniform and 3,4 along this line of elongation.

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,750
So we know that PCA finds a coordinate system that centers itself in the data

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,100
and aligns the x axis with the principal axis of variation.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,460
Where do you think, relative to the old coordinate system x and

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,710
y, is the center of origin for this new coordinate system?

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,390
Please truncate to the closest integer.
