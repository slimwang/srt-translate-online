1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:04,899
So now we've arrived at these two equations. This is what we learned about Euler's number,

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,099
and this is what you saw in the previous quiz about the exponential function.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,799
Where X was equal to pi. These equations are very elegant, but highly inefficient.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,232
Who wants to compute the product of millions or billions of factors?

5
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:27,432
Power series come to our rescue. If you actually want to compute Euler's number or the exponential function,

6
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:33,432
you're going to use power series. So let's try and turn this product into a sum of powers of X.

7
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:41,566
To get started, here's a quiz for you: One plus X over four to the fourth power. What would that be?

8
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:49,966
Some number without X plus some number times X, plus some number times X squared,

9
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:58,399
plus some number times X to the third power, plus some number times X to the fourth power.

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:06,367
Fill in these numbers using integers such as three or fractions such as five over 42.
