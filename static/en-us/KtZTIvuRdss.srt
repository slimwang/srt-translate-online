1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,980
All right, so it turns out there is going to

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,605
be an useful step here. Which is, we are

3
00:00:03,605 --> 00:00:07,450
going to take advantage of the fact that minus epsilon

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,130
is greater than or equal to the natural law of

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,500
one minus epsilon; which maybe it's not so obvious

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,010
but if you plot it you could see that it's

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,960
true. If this is the epsilon axis then minus

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,360
epsilon looks like a straight line going down like that.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,386
>> Sure it's got slope minus one.

10
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:25,400
>> Yep, and the log of one minus epsilon looks like this,

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,530
it starts off, they'll they're totally lined up at zero, epsilon zero.

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,350
>> Sure because one minus zero is one then absolute log of one is zero.

13
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,060
>> Exactly, and then what happens is it starts to fall away from it, the

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,160
slope is actually, I mean you could, you

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,640
can test this by taking the derivative of

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,510
it but the slope is if it's you

17
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,500
know it's monotonically I'm changing [LAUGH] so that

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,000
it falls away from the line and always

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,510
stays below it,okay, so if we believe that,

20
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,480
which, you know I'm going to just say calculus.

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,730
>> Well, you can kind of see that, right? Because

22
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,170
when epsilon is one, that would be the natural log of

23
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,500
zero and the only way you can raise e to

24
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,730
a power and get zero, is by having effectively, negative infinity.

25
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,340
>> Yeah, so right, by then, it's definitely below and but, it

26
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,280
stay below all along, I mean, because, just that is not enough, because.

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,500
>> Well, it has to stay below all along because

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,730
natural long is the natural log is a monotonic function.

29
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,960
Alright, so it can't like, get bigger and then

30
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,480
get smaller again, so, yeah, okay I buy that.

31
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,985
>> Good, alright, so if that's the

32
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:28,260
case,if we accept this line, then, it's also

33
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,990
going to be the case, that one minus epsilon to the m, is than or equal

34
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,810
e to the minus epsilon m, so why is that? So, if you multiply both

35
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,360
sides by m, and then take each of

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,190
the both sides, you get exactly this expression.

37
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,630
>> Sure. Alright?

38
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,970
So now that we've gotten that, we can use it

39
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,310
here in our derivation and rewrite that as, the size

40
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,350
of the hypothesis space times e to the minus epsilon

41
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,810
m. Alright that gives us another upper bound on the quantities

42
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,860
that we had before and this is much more convienent

43
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,530
to work with. The epsilon which had been kind of

44
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,490
trapped in the parentheses with the y minus now comes

45
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,449
up to the exponent where we can work with it better.

46
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,740
>> Sure.

47
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,370
>> Alright, so what this is is an upper bound

48
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,155
that the virgin space is not epsilon exhausted after m samples.

49
00:02:16,155 --> 00:02:17,421
>> Mm-hm.

50
00:02:17,421 --> 00:02:19,810
>> And that is what we would like delta to,

51
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,480
we would like delta to be a bound on that.

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,021
>> Mm-hm.

53
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:26,530
>> Right, so if delta is the,is the failure probability, essentially. So the

54
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,820
failure probability aught to be bigger than

55
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,360
or equal to this expression here, alright?

56
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,660
>> Okay.

57
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,285
>> So now, the last thing we need to do, is we can just

58
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:37,210
re-write this in terms of M.

59
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:42,060
>> Mm. So if we do that, let's see what happens. All right, when

60
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,910
we're done rewriting that what we find is the sample size M needs to

61
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:50,050
be at least as large as one over epsilon times the quantity the log

62
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,520
of the size of the hypothesis space plus the log of one over delta.

63
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,280
>> Okay and that is polynomial in one over epsilon,

64
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,020
one over delta, and the size of the hypothesis base.

65
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,830
>> Indeed!

66
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,250
>> Nice.

67
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,630
>> So that's pretty cool.

68
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,340
>> That is pretty cool.

69
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,260
>> So, right, it tells us if you

70
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,100
know the size of your hypothesis base, and you

71
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,410
know what your epsilon and delta targets are, you

72
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,760
know, sample a bunch, and then you'll be okay.

73
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,350
>> That's pretty good!
