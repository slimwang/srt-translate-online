In this probability question, we study a potentially loaded or unfair coin, which we flip twice.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Say the probability for it coming up heads both times is 0.04.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
These are independent experiments with the same coin.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I wonder what is the probability it comes up tails twice if we flip the same coin twice.
