Here's another problem similar to the last one. Just to keep checking your

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,070
understanding of these log properties. Once again, figure out the value of the

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,500
expression on either side of each equation. And then use that information to

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,000
figure out which of these equations is true.
