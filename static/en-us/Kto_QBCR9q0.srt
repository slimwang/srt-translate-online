1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,790
Alright, so, one of the things that's very helpful about regression is

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,450
that in many ways it's very simple to visualize, it's very simple

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,570
to think about what some of the issues are and all the

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,460
various topics in machine learning that are really important to understand and

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,720
sometimes are difficult concepts really do come up in a fairly easy

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,070
to understand way. So what I'd like to do now is to

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,890
step through an example Of doing some regression and to point out

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,790
what some of the pitfalls are and how they're generally handled in

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,310
the machine learning context. So, this graph that I put

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,960
up here, is, we just made these numbers up, but it's

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,260
supposed to tell us a, a little bit about housing

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,000
prices. So let's imagine that we're off to buy a house

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,170
and What we notice is that there's lots of different

14
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,810
houses on the market, and there are lots of different, sizes,

15
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,749
right. So ,the square footage of the house can vary. And

16
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,134
in this case the houses that I visited can be between,

17
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,320
about 1,000 to 10,000 square feet. And of course, as

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,910
you get bigger houses, you tend to get more, the, the

19
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,420
prices tend to go up, too. Alright, so the price

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,400
that the house cost is, tends to rise with the size

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,420
of the house. So, what I've done here is I've

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,490
plotted as a little x say a set of nine houses

23
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,030
that I've observed. Start off over here with a house

24
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,790
that's a 1,000 square feet and cost a $1,000? I don't

25
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,740
know what year this happened in. And we end

26
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,790
up with a house that is 10,000 square feet

27
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,730
and cost about $6,000. Again, I don't. This is

28
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,610
not true in Providence Rhode Island, I'll tell you that.

29
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:28,520
>> Are you sure?

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,000
>> Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,820
>> Yeah, it's really not true in Atlanta Georgia.

32
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,070
>> So Alright... So, so, so imagine that this is the relationship we

33
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,500
observe. But now we want to answer a question like, Well, what happens

34
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,050
If we find a house on the market and it's about $5,000,

35
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,110
what do you think a fair price for that would be? So what

36
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,850
do you, what do you think, Charles? Looking at this, what do

37
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,750
you think a fair price for a 5,000 square foot house would be?

38
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,234
>> Apparently about $5,000.

39
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:58,220
>> About, $5,000. Right. So, how did you do that?

40
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,090
>> I looked at the graph, I went over to 5,000 square

41
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,540
feet at the x-axis and I went up. Until I found ,where one

42
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,760
of the x's was on the y axis and I said, oh, that's about 5,000 square feet.

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
>> Well, but there was no corresponding point for that,

44
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,800
so you had to interpolate or something ,uh, based on the

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,700
points that were there you had to kind of imagine what

46
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,580
might, might be happening at the 5,000 square foot mark, right?

47
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,670
>> That's true, although this one was a little easy because

48
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,820
at 4,000 and 6,000 square feet, they were almost exactly the same.

49
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,020
>> Mm, and so that, to you, made it feel like there was probably ,um,

50
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,510
that's probably the level where things in this range would be.

51
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:35,810
>> Yeah.

52
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,260
>> Okay. Alright, that seems kind of

53
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,340
reasonable. So sure, though what we're going to

54
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,570
do in this case is actually try to find a, a function that fits this.

55
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,260
>> Mm-hm.

56
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,630
>> Alright ,so what we can do is actually say, well what

57
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,170
if there is a linear relationship. What would be the best linear

58
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,335
function that captures the relationship between the size and the cost. So

59
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:58,610
,what I have here is, it turns out of all the possible

60
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,710
linear functions, this is the one that minimizes the

61
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:07,240
squared error, the squared deviation, between these x points

62
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,280
and the corresponding position on green line. So it

63
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,300
finds a way of balancing all those different errors against

64
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,300
each other and that's the best line we've got.

65
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,340
Now in this particular case, it's interesting right, because if

66
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,360
you put your idea of 5,000 square feet. Look

67
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,100
what this line predicts. It's something more like $4,000, right.

68
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,590
Do you see that?

69
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,990
>> I do. That is doesn't seem right to me.

70
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,600
>> It doesn't, yeah, it doesn't really look like a very good fit. But it

71
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,050
does at least capture the fact that there

72
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,990
is increasing cost with, with increase in size.

73
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,860
>> That's true.
