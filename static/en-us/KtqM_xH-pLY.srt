1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,200
Let's add a new style sheet and

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,370
a media query that applies only when
the view port is wider than 500 pixels.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:13,920
I'll add a new linked CSS file with a
media attribute, and I'll set the value

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,770
to screen and min-width 500 pixels so

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,730
that it's only applied when
the screen is over 500 pixels.

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,510
You may see references to other
media types, but ignore them.

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,990
Media types like handheld, projected, or

8
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,690
embossed never really gained any
traction and don't do anything.

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,290
Just stick with screen and

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,850
print if you think your users
are going to want to print your page.

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,520
I'll take a look at the style
sheet that gets applied and

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,840
see that it changes
the background color to blue.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,600
All right.

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,680
I'll reload the page in the browser.

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,810
Notice that the background remains
white, but as I start to resize it,

16
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,610
once it hits that 500 pixel break point,

17
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,610
the screen turns blue because
the media query's been matched.
