00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Suppose you observed a number of different fires and you graph

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
the number of firefighters versus the size of the fire.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And for the sake of the argument, let's assume we studied four fires

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
with 10, 40, 200, and 70 firefighters involved

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and the sizes of the fires were given as follows: 100, 400, 2000, and 700

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
in terms of the surface area that the fire occupied.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Putting this into a diagram, you get pretty much the following.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Put the number of fighters. In fact, you've already learned this looks very linear.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So, let me ask a question--is the number of the firefighters correlated with the size of the fire?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Yes or no? Check one of the two boxes.
