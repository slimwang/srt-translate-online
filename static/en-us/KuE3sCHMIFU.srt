1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,070
There are dozens of frame works besides Bootstrap available,

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,320
Foundation 4 by Zerb and

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,540
Yaml 4 by Derk Jesse, provide huge sets of features comparable to Bootstrap.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,344
You'll find everything from responsive grid systems and nice looking buttons, to

5
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:21,060
Java script modules for interactive elements like drop down menus and carousels.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,950
If you need simplicity other frameworks like 960 Grid, Susy and Frameless

7
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,610
provide their own grid systems without the overhead of additional features.

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,930
Bootstrap is currently one of the most popular frameworks and

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,460
actually that's why we're using it.

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,870
It does, however, include some advanced functionality you might never need.

11
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,010
The good news is that because it's so robust, after you've mastered Bootstrap

12
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,660
you'll be able to pick up other, simpler frameworks with very little effort.

13
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,980
