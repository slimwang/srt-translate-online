00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,880
So that concludes this lesson, and

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,210
we've looked up a lot of
pretty complicated code.

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,680
And been able to digest it and
understand what's going on.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,970
&gt;&gt; And trust us, a lot of the problems
you're going to face in programming for

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,290
VR are problems you
can't solve on your own.

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,560
Being able to go out on the web, find
some code that you've never seen before,

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,630
and put them as yours so
your solution is critical.

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,731
So, you've a bit of
experience doing that now and

9
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:24,410
I hope it makes it a lot
easier in the future.

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,000
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, definitely feel
free to look at Google or

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,490
the Unity documentation for example
code that you can use in your project.

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,130
And good job going through this lesson.
