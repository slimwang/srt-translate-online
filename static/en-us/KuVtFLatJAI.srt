00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:05,550
Lamport's clock serves as the theoretical underpinning,

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,120
for achieving deterministic execution in distributed systems,

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,005
despite the fact that that there are

4
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:15,460
nondeterminism that are existing due to vagaries of

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,610
the network and due to drifts in the clocks, and so on. It's a

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:25,370
nice feeling that we can come up with. Conditions that need to be satisfied in

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:31,500
order to make sure that we can have deterministic executions and avoid anomalous

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,440
behaviors using Lamport's clock, both logical clocks.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,610
Where it is sufficient, as well as

10
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,730
the physical clock conditions. In the next part of this lesson module. We

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,230
will discuss techniques for making the operating

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,690
system, communication software stack efficient for dealing

13
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,150
with network communication.
