1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,014
Now we've finished adding the code to create our

2
00:00:04,014 --> 00:00:08,150
author-driven narrative by animating the World Cup.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,910
Now I want to enable the reader to be able to drill down further into our

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,950
data by using D3's event binding to enable interaction.

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,410
While it's great to see the year's animates by us.

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,940
In succession it's very hard to compare one year to the next.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,760
Especially if they may not be sequential.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,190
For example, if I want to compare what happened in 1930 with the world cup

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,160
with what happened in 2014 in Brazil.

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,200
I would have to wait for

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,240
the animation to go through, or dig into the data myself.

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,120
To remedy this, I want to add some buttons that correspond to all the years of

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,710
the World Cup, where if a user clicks on one it jumps to

14
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,370
that individual year and updates the map.

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,250
In this case,

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,560
we're going to be adding some div elements based on the years of the World Cup.

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,489
To start, we're simply selecting the body.

18
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,030
Appending a parent div with class years button, which is then

19
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,370
going to contain 20 elements corresponding to every year of the World Cup
