In linear regression we are given a data set where the x's go 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and the y's 2, 5.2, 6.8, 8.4, and 14.8.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'd like to find the formula y = w1x = w0 by minimizing the residual quadratic error

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
as we learned in class in linear regression.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What will be w1, and what will be w0?
