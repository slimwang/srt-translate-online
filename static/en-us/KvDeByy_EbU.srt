Reviews have become a common part of everyday software development practice.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,260
As such, much has been learned about how to perform them.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,530
What follows in this lesson are some dos and don'ts of gleaned from

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:16,000
actual experience. We begin with some about the participants. First off,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,390
reviews should not be used for personnel eva, evaluations.

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,650
If participants feel that what they say about someone else's code will affect

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,360
their performance rating or salary, they may be reluctant to speak. For

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,340
this reason managers should in general not attend review meetings unless they

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,620
have participated technically in the production of the artifact being reviewed.

10
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,710
Or they're outside of the participant's reporting hierarchy. Similarly,

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,500
in general it is not a good idea to allow non-participant observers in

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,770
review meetings as they can provide distractions. Don't treat a review as

13
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,140
an opportunity for training new staff members. This will reduce the productivity

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,750
of the review session. Instead, hold a separate meeting with the trainee.

15
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,900
The author of the artifact being reviewed should not be the moderator or

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,150
recording. These are specialized tasks that require full concentration.

17
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,960
Some organizations also require that the author not be the reader.
