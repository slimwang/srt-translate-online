Try rationalizing this denominator, you can use the last problem as a guide,

2
00:00:03,672 --> 00:00:07,640
and think about what you would need to do to change this denominator so that it

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,148
doesn't contain a cube root. When you think you have the final numerator, and

4
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:17,953
the final denominator, enter them here. Also, be sure to simplify if possible.
