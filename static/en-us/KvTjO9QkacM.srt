1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer happens to be the square foot costs $30,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but there is a constant cost added of $2000.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If you plug this in, you'll find, for example, that 1700 times 30 gives $51,000,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
but if you add the $2000, you'll correctly get $53,000.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Do it again with 2100 square feet over here multiplied by $30, add your $2000.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You get $65,000 and so on.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now, again, arriving at those numbers is nontrivial.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I wouldn't be surprised if you weren't able to complete this exercise.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But if you did, you're quite amazing, because that is the relationship between the price

10
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the size in my example.
