1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,494
All right, if we search for

2
00:00:01,494 --> 00:00:05,150
a libGDX ShapeType, the first
result is exactly what we want.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,480
And, if we scroll down a little bit,

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,720
we see that the three elements of this
enumeration are filled, line and point.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,400
Filled draws solid shapes,
line draws lines or

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,140
outlines of solid shapes, and
point, well, draws points.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,650
The libGDX Javadocs
are a fantastic resource.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,230
For instance, if we jump up a level
to ShapeRenderer, we get a ton

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,230
of background information and
even some code snippets to get started.

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:31,900
Pretty cool, right?
