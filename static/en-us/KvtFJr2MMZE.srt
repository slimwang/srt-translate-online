1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,130
In this session,
we're going to talk about operators.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,310
Symbols like plus and

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,220
minus, some of the same symbols you
may have used before in math class.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,960
We're also going to
talk about expressions,

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,570
which make use of operators.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,720
Expressions are statements that
can be reduced to a single value.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,950
This session should be a fun one,
so let's get started.
