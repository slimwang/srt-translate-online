1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,950
>> Okay Michael, you go an answer for me? This isn't meant to be a hard quiz.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,340
>> Oh good. Cause I actually have two answers for you.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,640
>> Oh, I like that.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,200
>> So I would say right, right, up, up, right.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,880
>> Okay, so, right, right, up, up, right.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,790
>> But I feel like I could have also said up, up, right, right, right.

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,510
>> And you could have. Both of those are acceptable. right, right

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,420
does what you think it does. You move right and then right and

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,560
then up and then up and then right. And

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,040
that takes five steps. Or you could have gone

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,270
up, up, right, right, right, which would also have

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,430
taken you five steps. So that's pretty easy, right?

13
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,910
>> Yeah, I thought so.

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,570
>> Rag. So yes, either of these would be correct. We're going to

15
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,510
stick with this one in particular, since they're equal, because we gotta pick

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,420
one of them. So this does point out something that often in

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,830
a decision problem like this, there are in fact multiple answers or multiple

18
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,020
optima, if I can tie it back

19
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,490
to our randomized optimization discussions. Okay, so you

20
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,860
got the quiz, you got the world, you understand what you can do here. Yes?

21
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,210
>> Yep.

22
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,700
>> Okay, cool. Now I'm going to throw in a little wrinkle.
