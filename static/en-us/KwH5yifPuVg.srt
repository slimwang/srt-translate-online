1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,430
So we just finished talking about the sign in flow. Now, we're going to talk

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,350
about a second concrete improvement of how to make the UX of your app

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,870
better. And that is with the checkout form. So if you have an application

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,800
that involves your users buying something from

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,760
you, then this step is really important.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,040
>> Yeah, and this is actually a point where 70%

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,460
of users on average on the Internet. Drop off meaning that

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,310
there's 70% abandonment rate of shopping carts across the

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,240
web. That's a huge number. That means like three

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,670
out of ten people are actually making it through

11
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,460
this form. When they see this form the first

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,690
reaction that people have is they run away. So,

13
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,890
so how do you actually make this form better

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,020
since it's such a critical part of you actually

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,940
getting paid. We need to make it easier for users.

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,230
>> Yeah, exactly. So how would you improve this form?

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,778
So, would you add more steps, for example?

18
00:00:53,778 --> 00:00:55,679
Instead of having a single page with all

19
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,600
this information about building information, shipping information, credit

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,160
card information. Would you break it out into multiple

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,970
steps? Or would you improve the visual layout

22
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,970
of this form. Would you add more spacing,

23
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,960
bigger fonts, and make it so that people

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,810
can more easily type information in this thing. Or,

25
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,940
my favorite, would you actually add more text boxes to this form. because, you

26
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,260
know, that's the one thing that people like to do is fill out more

27
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,620
information on tiny, tiny mobile screens. Or

28
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,440
would you rather just replace this form

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,860
entirely with a pre-canned solution, like check

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,580
out with Google, or with PayPal, or Amazon.
