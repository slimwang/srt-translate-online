00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,200
So here's the palette that Nick created
running in an actual Android app.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,470
The first thing I did was
create a colors.xml file

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,610
containing the colors
that I wanted to specify.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,325
For the names, I used what was listed
in the material design guidelines, so

5
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:22,990
indigo_300, indigo_500,
700, and pink_a200.

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,870
And the use the hexadecimal value for
those colors.

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:32,470
In the style for the app, I used those
identifiers, prefixed by @color,

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:38,710
and a slash for my color primary,
primary dark, and the accent color.

9
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,200
This makes it whole
lot more readable and

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,810
you only have to change colors in
one place, your colors.xml file.

11
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:47,790
In the xml for

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:53,800
our view, we can specify those
identifiers in a couple different ways.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,090
So we can see here, we set our app
bar layout, that's the container

14
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,790
that holds our app bar, to have
a background with the primary color.

15
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,570
Now the reason we have
this question mark here

16
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,920
is that colorPrimary refers
to a theme local attribute.

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,000
We could have also listed
?attr/colorPrimary.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,370
So if we look at
the floating action button

19
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:24,120
you might notice that there isn't any
designation of color information here.

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,840
That's because behind the scenes,

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,350
it assigns the color accent
value if you specified it.

22
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,440
So check out this link, which is also
specified in the instructors notes,

23
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,830
to see what other attributes you can
change and customize in material design.
