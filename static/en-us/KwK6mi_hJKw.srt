We know that 3-DOF tracking allows VR
hardware to sense your head rotation.

2
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:07,370
But how does that happen?

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,596
It's pretty incredible how quickly and
accurately VR headsets detect rotation.

4
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:13,895
How do they do it?

5
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:18,470
Well the answer is these headsets are
using a really cool electronic device

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,421
called an IMU.

7
00:00:19,421 --> 00:00:21,906
Or Inertial Measurement Unit.

8
00:00:21,906 --> 00:00:26,586
An Inertial Measurement Unit is
a tiny sensor that is really good at

9
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:29,940
quickly and
accurately detecting rotations.

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,353
It does this by combining the data
from an on board accelerometer,

11
00:00:35,353 --> 00:00:38,067
magnetometer, and gyroscope.

12
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:42,669
Basically, it's using gravity and
the Earth's magnetic field to constantly

13
00:00:42,669 --> 00:00:46,993
infer which way it's pointed, and using
some fancy math an IMU is able to do

14
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:50,861
a surprisingly good job at detecting
the direction it's facing.

15
00:00:50,861 --> 00:00:54,065
[BLANK_AUDIO]

16
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:56,248
So that's how 3-DOF works.

17
00:00:56,248 --> 00:00:59,267
Sometimes an IMU is embedded
inside your VR headset.

18
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:03,879
And sometimes the IMU inside
your phone is used instead, but

19
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:09,042
no matter what, all modern 3-DOF
tracking uses some kind of IMU.

20
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:10,360
Pretty neat right?
