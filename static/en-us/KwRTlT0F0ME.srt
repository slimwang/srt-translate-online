1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,480
With the basic app you've just built,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,090
you can configure the initial state
of the map in a number of ways.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,850
For documentation on all of the ways you
can configure it, using XML attributes,

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,690
look in the instructor notes below.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,480
But for now we'll configure
a few attributes to show

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,210
something interesting.

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,280
So here's the layout that you had
just created with your fragment

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,990
containing the maps fragment.

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,474
And this gave you the default Google
maps that you've been using throughout.

10
00:00:24,474 --> 00:00:26,750
But what we're going to do is
we're going to change this.

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,610
So we're going to take a look at
New York City with a flyover type view.

12
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,514
So first of all, there's going to be
a number of attributes on the fragment

13
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:34,858
that we're going to need to set.

14
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:37,790
And we're going to do these
using the Maps namespace.

15
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,830
So we need to tell the XML
about the Maps namespace first.

16
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,490
So I'm going to do that up here.

17
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,640
And you see,
we have XML namespace tool equals this.

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,937
We're going to create a new
XML namespace for our map.

19
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:52,593
And here are the details for
the XML namespace for map.

20
00:00:52,593 --> 00:00:55,380
As you can see, xmlns:map is equal to

21
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,834
http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-au-
to/.

22
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:04,160
So this will give us the map attributes
that we can now add to our fragment.

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,870
Map attributes will consist of
things such as the latitude and

24
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,870
the longitude of what
you want to look at.

25
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,947
So the latitude and

26
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:13,728
longitude of the area in New York City
we're going to look at a la now.

27
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,328
Here you can see, I've added
the map camera target latitude and

28
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:19,068
map camera target longitude.

29
00:01:19,068 --> 00:01:22,010
Don't worry about the red
underlines on them at the moment.

30
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,510
Now, when you're looking at a map,

31
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,540
you actually look at a map
through a virtual camera.

32
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,040
So you tell the camera
the target latitude and

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,950
longitude that it's going to look at.

34
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,618
So the latitude of downtown
New York City is 40.7484 and

35
00:01:35,618 --> 00:01:38,972
the longitude is negative 73.9857.

36
00:01:38,972 --> 00:01:42,445
But what this is going to do is, if you
remember when you first run the map,

37
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:45,730
you had a view from high in
orbit looking down on the Earth.

38
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,400
And this will do that, but it will
be looking down on New York City.

39
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,430
But all it's going to
do is shift the camera.

40
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,040
From being high in orbit looking down on

41
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,280
the equator to being high in orbit
looking down on New York City.

42
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,661
So we also want to move the camera so
we zoom down onto New York City.

43
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,180
And we'll change a couple of things.

44
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,810
I'm going to add them and
then talk through them one by one.

45
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,140
So these are the three
attributes that I've added.

46
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,292
The first is the Camera-Bearing.

47
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:11,720
The Camera-Bearing is the direction
that the camera is looking at,

48
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,633
with zero degrees being looking north,
180 degrees being looking south.

49
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:18,862
So as a result, you can see I'm
looking at 112.5 degrees, so

50
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:22,118
I'm kind of looking east
with my camera bearing.

51
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:25,730
Next is going to be the camera tilt, so
if you can imagine the camera when it's

52
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,910
looking straight down,
it's going to be tilted at 90 degrees.

53
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,670
But if I can change that to 65 degrees,

54
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,910
then the camera is going to be appearing
somewhat at an angle looking down, so

55
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,800
we have a nice 3-D isometric
view of the world beneath us.

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,470
And then finally is the Camera ZOOM.

57
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,050
The larger the number, the closer
you are to the surface of the Earth.

58
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,790
So if you can imagine a Camera ZOOM 0,
that's what we've had all along,

59
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,390
where the camera is way up.

60
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,790
Looking down on the Earth.

61
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,260
But with a Camera ZOOM 17, I'm going
down really close to the Earth.

62
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,918
And as you'll see, because I've
got a camera tilt of 65 degrees,

63
00:02:56,918 --> 00:03:00,083
I'm getting a 3D view of
the skyscrapers in New York City.

64
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,678
And with the Camera ZOOM being 17,

65
00:03:01,678 --> 00:03:04,940
I'm actually lower than the level
of some of these skyscrapers.

66
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,550
So, let's run the application and
see what it looks like.

67
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,380
So, now here we see the application
running on my tablet.

68
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,120
It gives us a view of downtown New York,
and I can actually scroll around and

69
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,160
see the city in three dimensions.

70
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,450
So I can see some of the skyscrapers
that are cylindrical in shape.

71
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,472
And as we had an earlier on,

72
00:03:20,472 --> 00:03:23,450
we were actually looking the base of the
Empire State Building, and here you can

73
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,270
see the Empire State Building rising
out of the view of the camera.

74
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,140
Because the camera is actually lower
than the height of the building.

75
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,759
And as I zoom around New York City and
I pan around, we can take a look at some

76
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,150
of the interesting features
in some of the buildings.

77
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,130
For example, here is the United Nations
headquarters, overlooking the river.

78
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,060
Here are things like some of
the islands in the river itself, and

79
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,970
we can see the skyscrapers on them.

80
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,000
Sometimes, it takes a little while for
them to show up.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,880
So you've effectively gotten
all of this for free,

82
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,390
you didn't need to set up anything to
get the 3D views or anything like that.

83
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,530
Just basically by the fact
that you tilted the camera and

84
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,070
were close enough into the earth,
to be able to see the 3D views.

85
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,210
If I were to zoom out you'll see,

86
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,880
I'm just going to see now a pan-view
of New York City without the 3D.

87
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,029
As I zoom out, you can see we
were facing towards the East,

88
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:06,713
looking out over Long Island.

89
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:10,437
When I zoom in over the city again, once
I get close enough we'll start seeing

90
00:04:10,437 --> 00:04:12,744
the buildings and
the skyscrapers popping up.

91
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:14,572
And there they are.

92
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:15,377
Pretty simple,

93
00:04:15,377 --> 00:04:19,250
just all of this was done just by
setting attributes on the map fragment.

94
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:19,910
Pretty cool, right?
