1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,806
Once again, we substitute m in place of x. And we end up with this expression, m

2
00:00:04,806 --> 00:00:09,560
squared minus m plus 2. We can't simplify this any further, since none of these

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,354
are like terms. So, this is our final answer.
