1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:06,530
Moving from top to bottom, what CSS
property is used to italicize text?

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,553
For this one,
I'll bring up Mozilla CSS reference and

3
00:00:09,553 --> 00:00:11,796
see what they have on italicizing text.

4
00:00:11,796 --> 00:00:16,546
If I search for the word italicize,
the first result font-style reads

5
00:00:16,546 --> 00:00:21,708
italic specifies that font face is an
italicized version of the normal font.

6
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,360
That certainly sounds like
what I'm looking for.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,630
If I follow the link, scroll down.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,320
I can see that font-style's in fact, the
property I should use to italicize text.

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,770
So the answer for
the first one is font-style.

10
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,910
The next question asks, what CSS
property is used to underline text?

11
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,100
This time,
I'll search CSS-Tricks CSS almanac.

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,180
If I go to their page and search
text underline, I get a result for

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,730
the property text-decoration.

14
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,950
And if I click the link,
the top of the page reads,

15
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,840
the text-decoration property adds
an underline, overline, line through, or

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,830
a combination of lines
to the selected text.

17
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,430
That's what I want.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,200
And check this out.

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,890
Further down the page, CSS-Tricks even
has a demo of the property in action.

20
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,470
That's awesome.

21
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,670
So text-decoration is the answer for
number 2.

22
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,110
For number 3, what CSS property's
used to uppercase text?

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,500
Let's try a good old Google search and
see what we can find.

24
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:29,795
I'll simply type what CSS property
is used to uppercase text.

25
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:35,185
And look at that, our first result
reads the text-transform property

26
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:39,845
is used to specify uppercase and
lowercase letters in text.

27
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:41,960
Sure enough,
that's the answer for number 3.

28
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,480
Finally, what CSS property
is used to bold text?

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,980
Since you've seen some examples for

30
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,150
how to use CSS references,
I'll just write this one in.

31
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,250
To bold text,
use the font-weight property.

32
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,970
Remember, CSS references are great tools
and you should reference them often.

33
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,720
If you ever get stuck
during development,

34
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,940
you can always refer back to them
