1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,470
But as you remember, I said it's not only about your product or service features,

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,230
it's also about pain killers.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,240
That is, what are you going to reduce or eliminate for the customer?

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,110
So here's a couple hypotheses of what some pain killers might be

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,580
because pain killer until now might have sounded like,

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,370
"Well, wait a minute. Do I hand the customers aspirin?"

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,740
And the answer is yeah, you're really going to solve a pain for them,

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,530
but the pain might be is your product going to produce savings--

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,240
that is, in time or money or efforts?

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,120
Is it going to make them feel better?

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,400
That is, entertainment products don't solve a problem but they solve a need.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,490
Does it kill frustration, annoyances, or things that give them a headache?

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,660
Does it fix solutions they already have but are underperforming

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,890
because you have new features or you're better or faster?

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,780
Or does it end difficulties and challenges that customers encounter every day?

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,500
Does it make things easier or help them get things done or eliminate resistance?

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,810
Does it wipe out or add to negative social consequences--

18
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,810
loss of face, power, or trust--

19
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:09,990
or add to social status like Facebook and Twitter, etc, or even LinkedIn?

20
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,100
Or does it eliminate risk?

21
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,840
Is it financial, social, or technical risks?

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,780
Or what could go very wrong?

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:22,540
So pain killers, your hypotheses, should include which one of these or some others

24
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,780
because this list is finite.

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,160
There might be other things you're solving and taking away pain from customers.

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:35,990
But you need to be able to articulate, based on your interactions outside the building

27
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,120
with customers, "Here's what they said."

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,850
"And when I bounced our product off of them, they said, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.'"

29
00:01:41,850 --> 99:59:59,999
"'That really solves this pain and, more importantly, is an important pain.'"
