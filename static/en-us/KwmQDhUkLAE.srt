The earliest known academic rating about the meaning of random was by John Venn

2
00:00:04,457 --> 00:00:08,650
in 1888 and his book called the logic of chance. He said, Perhaps the best

3
00:00:08,662 --> 00:00:12,541
typical example that we can give of the scientific meaning of random

4
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:17,099
distribution is afforded by the arrangement of the drops of rain in a shower. No

5
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:21,430
one can give a guess whereabouts at any instant a drop will fall, but we know

6
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:25,837
that if we put out a sheet of paper it will gradually become uniformly spotted

7
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:30,473
over. And if we were to mark out any two equal areas on the paper, these would

8
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:34,880
gradually tend to be struck equally often. Therefore, when we have a random

9
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:39,504
sample, each subject has an equal chance of being selected. And then our sample

10
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:42,111
is more likely to approximate the population.
