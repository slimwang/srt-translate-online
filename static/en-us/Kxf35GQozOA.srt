1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,100
Frameworks really are incredible.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,640
This is what I wrote down.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,270
Frameworks need to
maintain chunks of HTML

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,880
because different HTML content
is displayed at different times.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,791
DOM manipulation because views
are inserted and removed.

6
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:22,380
Data processing because
I can filter the data.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,140
And handling user interaction, because I
can click on things and enter data and

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:26,660
it responds.

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,190
We'll be digging into a lot of
the features that Frameworks provide.

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,770
But if you want to get a head start,

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,300
check out the links in
the instructor notes.
