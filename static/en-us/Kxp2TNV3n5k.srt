1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,140
Nothing happens in a vacuum, this class included.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,090
Now, while many of you may be taking this course because you're interested in

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:12,430
data visualization theory and practice using open source tools like D3,

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,210
this class is actually part of the much larger data science track at Udacity.

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,520
What I've shown here is a graphic from Ben Fry's PhD thesis,

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,010
Computational Information Design.

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,070
In it, he describes the larger process surrounding data visualizations,

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,330
including acquiring, transforming, and

9
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:36,200
eventually visualizing data to create engaging and effective graphics.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,330
This whole process maps quite nicely to the data science process as a whole.
