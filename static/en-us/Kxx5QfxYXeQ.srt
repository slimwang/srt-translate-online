00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,481
Better yet, we can chain together all the matrices that effect an object and

2
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:08,534
store what 3JS calls a world matrix. Say we have a hubcap that's part of a

3
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:12,576
wheel, that's part of a car. Each of these objects has its own concatinated

4
00:00:12,576 --> 00:00:17,053
matrix of transforms. If a program wants to display the hubcap on the screen, we

5
00:00:17,053 --> 00:00:21,688
need to multiply the hubcap's vertices by these three matrices in turn. Instead

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:25,976
of doing three matrix multiplies, we can concatenate the three matrices to form

7
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:30,154
a single world matrix and store that separately for the hubcap. This matrix is

8
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:34,290
the world matrix, or it's sometimes called the model matrix. Whatever you call

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,322
it, a single matrix multiply is then all that is needed to transform a vertex

10
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:40,813
from its model space to world space directly.
