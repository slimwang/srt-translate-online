00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,850
Although using the standard error of the estimate can help us assess the

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,090
accuracy of our predictions. We can make even more accurate predictions by

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,260
computing confidence intervals for our predicted values, our y-hats. In other

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,000
words, when we get our regression line, we have our expected value which is

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,720
this y-hat naught, for a specified value x-naught. However, the actual value

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,440
might be anything from up here, to down here, or it might be exactly equal to

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,120
our predicted value. Therefore, we might want a confidence interval around our

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,440
expected value for where the actual value might be. Similarly, we might want a

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,440
confidence interval for the true slope. We'll have a certain regression line

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,030
and we'll have calculated the slope for that regression line based on our

11
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:55,180
sample data. And this is just an example, the slope could be this, or flatter

12
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:00,080
down to here. A confidence interval for a slope can tell us the range for which

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,739
the true population's slope might be. You won't actually calculate the

14
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,140
confidence interval in this lesson, because we're going to assume that you'll

15
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,340
use a computer to get it. The important thing is that you know what it means.

16
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,810
For example, let's say we have some sample data that looks like this. We

17
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:24,215
calculate that the regression line is y equals bx plus a. Some slope and some

18
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:28,900
intercept. But lets say then that we're able to look at all the population

19
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:34,720
data. And it looks like this. Now it looks to be slightly downward sloping.

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,799
Since we're assuming this is the true regression line, we'll use the common

21
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,500
notation for the regression coefficients for the population. Oh, and these

22
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,040
should have hats since they're the predicted values. If this were the case,

23
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,490
where the sample regression line is positively sloping. But the true regression

24
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,120
line for the population is negatively sloping. That would mean that the

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:01,399
confidence interval for b has a negative lower bound and a positive upper

26
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:07,050
bound. It includes zero within this range. Therefore, if we run a two-tailed

27
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:12,030
hypothesis test for whether or not the slope is equal to zero. We would fail to

28
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,990
reject the null, meaning there's no evidence that there's a linear relationship

29
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:22,260
between x and y based on that sample. In fact, let's get more into hypothesis

30
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,300
testing for slope.
