1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,320
Okay, so this is going to be attendee, it does start with a vowel sound.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:04,900
>> Nice.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,300
>> Okay, on data type.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,800
>> So this is what it's going to by default make the name, and so I guess

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,640
in the case of attendees we'll have real names, we can just leave it as text.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,235
>> And.

7
00:00:19,235 --> 00:00:20,580
>> There's optional features, we can go back

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,850
and add them if we need them later.

9
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,260
>> Okay.

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,610
>> It's deployed, and actually, you might want to click

11
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,690
to launch the New Custom Tab wizard.

12
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,710
>> Okay. What would have happened if, what does that do?

13
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,369
>> If, it's going to allow us to create a tab automatically, so

14
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,030
we can add it into our app, just like how we have

15
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,680
the festival tab. If we didn't check that box, we could just

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,000
go create a tab by going through the setup tree on the left.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,510
>> The tab, so these guys up here?

18
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,960
>> At the top.

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,750
>> Home chatter files.

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,100
>> Exactly.

21
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,850
>> Okay, so, Save. Oh, New Custom

22
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,810
Object tab. Alright. Object attendee. Tab style.

23
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:55,940
This is fun. This is just like some image that represents our attendees?

24
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,980
>> Yup. This'll be the image that goes at the top when we click

25
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,980
into the tab. It can be random, it really doesn't matter what it is.

26
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,590
>> No, I want a good one. Okay, people, people, right?

27
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,850
>> That's right.

28
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,060
>> Okay. this optional. If it's optional

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,730
I'm basically just going to forget about it, Sam.

30
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,210
>> It's okay, yeah, don't fill it out.

31
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,190
>> Okay.

32
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,880
>> This again is security. Just leave a default on.

33
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,780
That's fine. Everyone will be able to see this tab.

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,500
And then this one is actually important, because it's choosing

35
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,790
which apps to add this tab to. So, we don't

36
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,460
really need to include it in all the other ones.

37
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,380
>> Oh.

38
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,160
>> But we want to select the festival app to add it to our festival app.

39
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,580
>> Save.
