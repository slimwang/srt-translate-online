1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,493
Let's start with an example. Let's say your in the shower and as your turning

2
00:00:03,493 --> 00:00:08,074
the shower handle off and the water stops, the shower handle breaks off. Now

3
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:11,666
you immediately assess what this event means to you. You might become very

4
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:13,997
stressed out when you realize that your going to have to call a plumber, that's

5
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:16,106
going to be expensive, your going to have to make time to meet the plumber,

6
00:00:16,106 --> 00:00:18,363
your going to have to clean your apartment to make it presentable, you had to

7
00:00:18,363 --> 00:00:20,657
find a place to put your cat, so the cat doesn't attack the plumber, when the

8
00:00:20,657 --> 00:00:25,425
plumber comes in. And the list goes on, and on, and on, about what stress

9
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:29,398
results just from breaking off your shower handle. This was the primary

10
00:00:29,398 --> 00:00:32,302
appraisal, you quickly assessed what happened and your emotional response to

11
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:35,294
it, which most certainly would have been a negative emotional response, because

12
00:00:35,294 --> 00:00:40,069
you're stressed about everything you have to do, just to fix the shower handle.

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,210
However, when this actually did happen to me, I stopped, took a second to think

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,452
about it, and my stress level actually decreased. First, I thought, this is a

15
00:00:49,452 --> 00:00:53,568
great opportunity to get a new shower handle and new shower head. Second, I

16
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:56,192
thought, how lucky I was the shower handle didn't break off when the water was

17
00:00:56,192 --> 00:01:00,013
still running, because I don't know how to turn the water off in my apartment.

18
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:02,418
So, I would've just been standing there with a broken shower handle in my hand,

19
00:01:02,418 --> 00:01:06,510
and the water just running, I wouldn't have known what to do. Third, I thought

20
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,030
that I needed to clean my apartment anyway, so this is a great opportunity to

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,010
make it nice and presentable.
