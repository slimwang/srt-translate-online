1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Well, in the global environment x is 1 and y is 2.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
When we call myfun, the rules from before say that

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
we should make storage spaces for all of the formal parameters: a, b, and x.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Here's b, here's x, so this must be a.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We fill them in with the values of the actual arguments.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A was 1 plus 2, that's 3. Great, that was already done.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
B is 3 plus 4. This evaluates to 7, so b is 7,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and x was 5 plus 6, so that's 11.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, at the end of the day, this is going to print out 21.
