The first thing I want you to do in
order to add a local permission system.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,430
Is to create a user
table in your database.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,980
We could store alot more user
information in this table.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,400
But for the sake of simplicity it
should have a layout similar to this.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,910
Also modify the restaurant.

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:13,940
And menu item models,

7
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,870
such that they have user_id
as foreign key relationships.

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,300
Look at the code for the Restaurant and
Menu Items classes in the database setup

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,770
dot py file, and see if you can figure
out how to add these modifications.

I will show you my answers
in the next video.
