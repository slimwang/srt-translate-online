00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,682
Did you get 3 x minus 4 y equals negative 8? If so, that is awesome. Now what

2
00:00:05,682 --> 00:00:11,708
makes this problem easier than the last one? Well first, the slope is given, so

3
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:17,563
we don't have to calculate the slope. The other is if we look at the point 0, 2.

4
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:24,398
The point 0, 2 is actually the y intercept because x is 0 and y is 2. Now if we

5
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:31,006
know the slope and we know the y intercept, we can very easily use a slope

6
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:37,838
intercept form and write y equals mx plus b which equals 3 4th times x plus 2

7
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:44,100
which is the y intercept. Since we want to write the equation in standard form,

8
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,203
I'm going to go ahead and multiply the equation through by 4. Giving me 4y

9
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:54,531
equals 3x plus 8. And if I want to write this in standard form. I need to move

10
00:00:54,531 --> 00:01:00,297
the 3x over to the other side. Which would give me negative 3x plus 4 y equals

11
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:06,566
8. Now you might be asking, why is this answer different from this answer? Well,

12
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:12,952
they're actually the same. If I were to take this equation and multiply the

13
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:19,972
whole equation through by negative 1, I'm going to get negative 1 times negative

14
00:01:19,972 --> 00:01:26,884
3x gives me 3x negative 1 times positive 4y gives me negative 4y and negative 1

15
00:01:26,884 --> 00:01:33,713
times positive 8 gives me negative 8. So as you can see this equation negative

16
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:39,935
3x plus 4y equals 8 is the same as the equation 3x minus 4y equals negative 8

17
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:45,647
Our convention typically use a math is that we do not have a negative

18
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,309
coefficient to our x variable.
