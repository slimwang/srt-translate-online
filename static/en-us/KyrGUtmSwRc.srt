1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,940
Now, that you've seen
the WeatherEntry class for

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,560
the weather table, it's your turn.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:06,860
Add the constants for

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,850
the location table in the LocationEntry
inner contract class.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,200
These constants included the table name,
and the name of each column.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,950
As we've shown in a few previous
diagrams, the columns need to store

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:25,010
the location setting, latitude,
longitude, and the city name.

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,720
After you finish coding
the location entry class,

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,190
make sure to look at the solution video.

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,760
You'll want to use the same constant
names that we use, since the code in

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,280
the other classes you received relies
on these constant names being the same.

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,148
Once you've finished,

13
00:00:39,148 --> 00:00:43,000
you will have defined all of
the columns for both of the tables.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,300
Next, we'll be ready to use these column
names to actually create the tables

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:47,850
in the database.
