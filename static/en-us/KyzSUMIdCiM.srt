00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,168
Finally, the third way in which we're able to store information is through what

2
00:00:04,168 --> 00:00:09,882
psychologists call an Associative Network. And this is a chain of associations

3
00:00:09,882 --> 00:00:14,273
between related concepts. From pet, it could go to dog or cat, and from dog and

4
00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:18,510
cat, look at how much it branches off. This is just a quick demonstration. I

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,928
could branch this a lot further. So, from pet, we could go to dog and cat and

6
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:26,685
from dog and cat, we could branch off so much more. They're both fuzzy, furry,

7
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:31,852
four-legged animals. I had a dog named Max. My whole family loved Max. He was a

8
00:00:31,852 --> 00:00:35,417
golden retriever. And my friend Noel loved cats. And then that makes me think

9
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:39,270
of college, and then my friends, and how I majored in psychology. This is a

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,152
just a really short, quick example of how much this could branch off. I could

11
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:46,066
double or triple this if I had time, but don't worry I won't make you guys sit

12
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:47,660
through that.
