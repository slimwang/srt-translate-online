00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,130
It turns out that any monomial that we encounter will be an example of a

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,207
polynomial. Monomials have one term, and are the products of constant

3
00:00:08,207 --> 00:00:12,796
coefficients and variables. Binomials are another type of polynomial. These

4
00:00:12,796 --> 00:00:17,597
contain exactly two terms. A trinomial is another example of a polynomial. This

5
00:00:17,597 --> 00:00:22,398
one has three terms. I've been throwing this word term around a lot. And a term

6
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:26,879
is simply the product of numbers and variables. This is one term. This is one

7
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,453
term. And this is one term. The same is true for these. When we have addition or

8
00:00:31,453 --> 00:00:36,033
subtraction between two terms, that's when we call it a binomial. And the same

9
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:40,656
is true in this case. We call this a trinomial. You can remember these terms

10
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:45,355
based on their prefix. Mono means one. Bi means two. And tri means three. That

11
00:00:45,355 --> 00:00:50,201
should be pretty familiar. A bicycle has two wheels. A triangle has three sides.

12
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:54,439
Maybe you can think of some other words that start with these prefixes.
