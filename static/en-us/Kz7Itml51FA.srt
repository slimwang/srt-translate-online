1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Unit 7--this unit is going to be kind of a grab bag of things I didn't get to cover

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
in this class and lectures up until now.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Basically, it's going to be real-world issues and some decisions--

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
what I look for in a web framework, how we host our stuff--

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
things like that and some of the decision-making process.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And we also spent a lot of time talking about Reddit.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
How we grew it to the extent that we can explain that and how we grew the architecture.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And we'll also do a couple of interviews, one with my friend Neil,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
who is the lead engineer at Reddit now.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Another one with Udacity, the engineers at Udacity,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
who will explain how they use App Engine in the real world.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now, I've only use App Engine really in the context of teaching this course,

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and built a number of small toy websites now.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But, these guys can actually talk about what is like to use App Engine in production

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
on a site with thousands of users.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There will be no quizzes. This is just for you to sit back and watch.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If these things don't interest you, just skip ahead to the homework.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If these things do interest you, welcome. It should be fun.
