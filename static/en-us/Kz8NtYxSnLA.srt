00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,555
What you see here is an algorithm to answer our question. It's a sequence of

2
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:13,370
steps. Each step is unambiguous, and so simple that a computer can execute it.

3
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,508
The sequence of steps will terminate and give us an answer. Now, I want you to

4
00:00:17,508 --> 00:00:23,771
play the sequence of steps and execute the algorithm yourself. And when you're

5
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:28,320
done, tell me what you computed for a total cost one and for total cost two.
