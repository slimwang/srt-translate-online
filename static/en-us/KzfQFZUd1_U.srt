00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:05,560
The equation would be x squared plus y squared equals 100. Great work if you

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,018
got that equation. We know, this is the equation of any circle centered at the

3
00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:16,430
origin. We just need to know the radius, r. In this case, the r value is 10.

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,800
So, we just plug in 10 for r. We'll have this equation. And then simplifying 10

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,890
squared, we'll get 100. So, this is the equation for our circle.
