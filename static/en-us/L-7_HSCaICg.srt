00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,790
Thanks Raido, with that in mind let's add

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,450
a Refresh Menu button to our app. For temporary

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,920
purposes only though, otherwise Raido would be mad at

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,882
us. On Android, menu options are defined in XML

5
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:14,440
and they can be declared for fragments or

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,390
activities. When the fragment or activity is created, it

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,790
inflates this XML into the actual menu items in

8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,440
the app. You'll see that there are Action buttons

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,230
which are menu items that appear in the Action bar,

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,670
such as this Search Menu item. This space is reserved

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,550
for the most prominent actions in your app. Then anything

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,990
else that's less important falls into the overflow menu by

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,790
tapping on this button with the three dots. These menu

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,560
items are ordered from most frequently used to least frequently

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,550
used. And on larger devices that have more screen real

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,710
estate, you can specify that some of these menu items can

17
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,120
actually go into the Action bar if there's room. If

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,160
you go back to our project in the Resources folder

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,660
which is called res, there is a Menu folder and

20
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,990
inside that there's a main.xml file. If you open that up

21
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,360
you see the menu layout XML, and that there's a

22
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,130
single menu option defined for Settings. It will never show up

23
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,350
as an action in the Action bar, meaning that it

24
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,780
will be in the Overflow menu. You can verify this by

25
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,880
checking the app on your phone. To define the ordering

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,200
of menu items, you can just add multiple items to this

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,580
XML file, and then they will show up in that order

28
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,680
in the app. If you don't like the order though, and

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,460
you want to explicitly set it, then you can specify

30
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,030
this order in Category, value. Right now it's set as 100,

31
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,460
so that the Settings menu will be at the bottom of

32
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,040
all the other menu options that we define in our app.

33
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,250
The only Menu option that should show up below the Settings

34
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,450
menu is the Help menu. Check out the link for more details.
