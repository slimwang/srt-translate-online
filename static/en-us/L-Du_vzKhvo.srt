00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now, let's look at the answer. What happens if we set stepping to false.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's take a look again at our code if we set stepping to false in here.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
As for this continue command, what's going to happen downstream.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So we return true. So receiving will be true. So we're going to exit this loop immediately.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Meaning that the next line will be executed, and now we have over here the stepping variable

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
being set to false--this means we're going to resume execution line by line unless this condition

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
becomes true--that is unless we actually reached a breakpoint.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The correct answer is the program resumes until the next breakpoint is reached.
