1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,850
Now, lets look at our
example graph from before.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,910
Now, I claimed that this
graph had a diameter of five.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,090
So there's gotta be a path
in here with five edges.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,490
Can you find it?

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,620
And what I want you to do, is mark
the edges of some path of length five.

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,280
So for example, the path from here
to here, involves three edges.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,800
So if that was your answer,
you'd mark the edges as shown.
