00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,960
Now that we set up the desktop and
Android backends,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,470
you are probably wondering about
the iOS and HTML backends.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,812
Well, the HTML backend is kind of hard
to run because you need to be running

4
00:00:09,812 --> 00:00:11,760
Gradle tasks from the command line.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,085
The IOS backend is even more difficult
because we need to first provision

6
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:18,755
a device for debugging,
which requires Xcode and some time.

7
00:00:18,755 --> 00:00:22,690
Also, as you might be aware, all the iOS
system APIs can only be accessed from

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,205
Objective-C or Swift, which makes
running a Java game kind of tricky.

9
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:29,775
We're not going to set up the iOS or
HTML backends for now.

10
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:32,445
But we've created bonus levels
explaining how to set up both,

11
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:35,095
which you can check out by following
the links in the instructor notes.
