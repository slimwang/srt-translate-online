00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,354
When we have a less than inequality, we perform the same steps. f could be less

2
00:00:04,366 --> 00:00:08,439
than positive 5, or f could be greater than negative 5. Remember, for the

3
00:00:08,451 --> 00:00:12,912
negative answer, we reverse the inequality sign. And here's what's interesting.

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,826
The greater-than symbol creates a union, or two separate regions, where the less

5
00:00:17,264 --> 00:00:22,080
than sign creates an intersection between two points. With just the flip of a

6
00:00:22,092 --> 00:00:26,235
sign, we can exclude entire numbers or include a small region. And let's look

7
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:30,320
more closely right here at these 2. We said we get an intersection, so that

8
00:00:30,332 --> 00:00:34,655
means f is between these 2 numbers. Let's rewrite these inequalities. Now that

9
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:38,520
I've switched the spot of these 2 inequalities, I'm going to reverse the

10
00:00:38,532 --> 00:00:42,900
direction of this inequality. I've switched this inequality around, so negative

11
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:47,042
5 is less than f. This is still the same as F being greater than negative 5.

12
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:51,448
Notice the f's are in the middle now. The f's are between my 2 numbers. We can

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,568
even write this as one inequality, and, in fact when you solve any absolute

14
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,911
value inequality with a less than symbol you can write it as one inequality with

15
00:00:59,923 --> 00:01:01,462
3 parts. Pretty impressive.
