1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,024
The two patterns that we just found are actually called perfect square

2
00:00:04,024 --> 00:00:08,786
trinomials. They're called this because we can represent the binomial squared as

3
00:00:08,786 --> 00:00:13,459
a perfect square. When we multiply out the binomial, we'll get the trinomial, a

4
00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:18,542
squared plus 2ab plus b squared. The only difference between the two patterns is

5
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:23,497
the plus sign and the minus sign, which also appears here in the second term.

6
00:00:23,497 --> 00:00:27,719
The second term is positive 2ab with the first one, and negative 2ab for the

7
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:32,046
second. Let's see if you can use these patterns to answer our next question.
