00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,698
Our first shot at multiplying each of the terms in the first expression by every

2
00:00:04,698 --> 00:00:09,600
term in the second set of parenthesis, gives us this long disgusting expression.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,206
But wait, maybe it's not really that gross, let's take a closer look. When we

4
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:18,805
notice which terms we have that are like terms, we see a minus y squared z and a

5
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:23,620
plus y squared z. So these directly cancel each other out. We do the same thing

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,878
with the other 2 middle terms positive yz squared and negative yz squared. All

7
00:00:28,878 --> 00:00:34,300
that we're left with in the end is a really simple expression, then. This long

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,473
factorized form is actually just equal to the sum of 2 cubes. Y cubed plus z

9
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:43,698
cubed. This is really incredible. Math is just so gorgeous.
