00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,430
I think there are three statements where we can certainly say by now that they are true.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:08,890
We know that every problem that is in P is also contained in NP.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,070
This is why we drew the picture like this. So, that's obvious.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,810
If every problem in NP is also contained in P

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,200
that would mean that we have a polynomial time algorithm for

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,310
vertex cover, independent set, and clique.

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,090
We do not know that to be true yet.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:28,090
Of course, we also don't know it to be false, but it's not something we can make a statement about.

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,110
And since we can't make a statement about this here,

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,890
we can also not to say that P and NP are equivalent or basically the same.

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,960
Now, the fourth one is probably the most subjective one so of course

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,440
it seems like NP should contain more problems than P

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,730
simply for the reason that non-determinism is just so powerful that

14
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:54,290
we would not expect that every problem that can be solved in polynomial time using non-determinism

15
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,830
can also be solved in polynomial time on a deterministic RAM

16
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,410
if you just think about how much time our simulation took

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,140
and of course it might not be the best possible simulation

18
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,200
but I think it's highly unlikely.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,190
We can't be sure, but that's why I wrote here it seems like NP should contain more problems

20
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,750
and not stated it as a fact so that I can make a check mark here.

21
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,860
Now, finally, vertex cover, independent set, and clique, if we knew that they were in P

22
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,490
we would have a polynomial time algorithm.

23
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,650
Can't really make that statement right now.

24
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,500
And finally, vertex cover, independent set, and clique, yes they are in NP.

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,930
We show that they can be solved in polynomial time

26
00:01:27,930 --> 99:59:59,999
if we have the wonderful and magic if better function available.
