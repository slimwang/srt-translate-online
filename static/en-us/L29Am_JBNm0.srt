1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,080
So we've talked about uh,classification and regression and gave a

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,240
couple of examples of each. So now I want you to

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,370
take a moment to make certain that you understand the

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,530
difference because it's a crucial difference for supervised learning. Here's a

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,130
very short little quiz. You have three questions here and

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,440
we divided the world up into some input to some learning

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,790
algorithm, whatever that learning algorithm is. The output that we're

8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,400
expecting and then a box for you to tell us whether

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,860
its classification or regression. So, the first question, the input is

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,110
credit history, whatever that means, the number of loans that you

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,220
have, how much money you make, how many times you've defaulted,

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,070
how many times you've been late, the sort of things that make

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,660
up credit history, and the output of the learning algorithm is

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,550
rather you should lend money or not. So you're a bank,

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,310
and you're trying to determine whether given a credit history, I

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,200
should lend this person money, that's question one. Is that classification, or

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,390
is that regression? Question two you take as input

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,110
a picture like the examples that we've given before.

19
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,710
And the output of your learning system is going

20
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,160
to be whether this person is of high school age,

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,630
college age, or grad student age. The third question is very similar.

22
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,660
The input is again a picture. And the output is, I guess, of the actual

23
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:19,300
age of the person, 17, 24, 23 and a half, whatever.

24
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,240
So take a moment and try to decide

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,330
whether these are classification tasks or regression tasks.
