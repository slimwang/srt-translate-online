00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,324
We're definitely getting there. We have everything related to y on the left side

2
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:08,354
of the equation, since t is our y coordinate, and everything related to x as

3
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:12,453
well as our slope on the right side. However, I see one thing that we can do to

4
00:00:12,453 --> 00:00:16,672
change this a little bit that I think will help us out. I provide a new form for

5
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:21,230
you that I'd like us to write this equation. So see if you can figure out which

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:26,141
variable, that's on the right side right now, belongs in which box. Please note

7
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:30,461
that I only want one variable in each box. And of course, I want this equation

8
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:32,448
to be equivalent to this equation.
