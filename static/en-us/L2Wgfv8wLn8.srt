1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,627
Mm-hm.

2
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:02,891
One second.

3
00:00:02,891 --> 00:00:05,909
All right.

4
00:00:05,909 --> 00:00:08,700
Great job generating
the last few reports.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,430
Your boss was able to use
the data you prepared for

6
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,880
her to identify some problems with
how the company was being run.

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,630
And now business is booming.

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,840
In the short amount of time
you've been learning Ruby,

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,150
you've already added value at Toy City.

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,600
Keep it up.

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,240
She's got another project for
you though.

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,330
After reviewing your reports, your boss
has decided that the inventory system

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,580
needs to be redone from the ground up.

14
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,189
Now, she knows it's a pretty big task,
so all she's looking for

15
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,340
right now is a proof of concept.

16
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,070
Show her that you can use
your new object oriented

17
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,430
skills to get a prototype
up off the ground.

18
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,890
For this project you'll be creating
a way to keep track of inventory,

19
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,510
customer data, and transactions.

20
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,260
These are the same types of problems
you'll commonly be solving when working

21
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,180
on a larger scale web app.
