1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,730
So now, we have the buzz image.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,000
We know it has a width and height.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Basically we want to use this to give it a numeric representation of this

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,630
image in two dimensions.

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,760
So we can actually be looking for information in it in the x and

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,490
the y directions.

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,340
The best way to refer to this would be a now a function I xy which

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,040
is a continuous function.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,430
Or if we have a discrete, we'd actually be able to refer to this as I of ij.

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,370
So i, j here would be discrete indices, which could be the number of

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,370
the rows and the column that we're trying to traverse this thing.

12
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,890
If this was, of course, a continuous function, we would be looking for

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:42,100
variables x and y to be able to now extract the information out of this image.

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,420
And of course, one more thing to add here is then basically we tried to

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,330
take the resolution of the image, which is represented in terms of width and

16
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,910
height as I showed in the last slide.

17
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,240
Or basically just showing here, very quickly, as to an image basically as

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,400
the scope of these images, defined by the width of the number of columns and

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,590
the height of the number of rows of this image.
