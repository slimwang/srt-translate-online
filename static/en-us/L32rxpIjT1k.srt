Hi, my name is Fernando.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,647
You may remember me from such courses
as Grand Central Dispatch or Core Data.

3
00:00:06,647 --> 00:00:11,460
Today we will tackle one of the most
feared technologies of the Apple stack,

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,810
auto layout.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,359
Auto layout allows you to specify
how your UI should behave

6
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:19,939
when the size of the screen or
the containing view changes.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,085
However, under this simple description
lays a very complex system.

8
00:00:25,085 --> 00:00:28,589
You've probably already tried
using it and ran away in fear, and

9
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:29,859
with good reason.

10
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:34,890
Auto Layout can be intimidating, and its
behaviors seems impossible to predict.

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,770
Put all your worries aside.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,440
By the end of this course you
will have tamed this beast, and

13
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,119
will feel confident creating UIs for
any Apple device.
