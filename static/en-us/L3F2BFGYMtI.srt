1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,890
As a Nanodegree student,

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:06,040
you can leverage your career development
projects by completing the resume

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,759
review and getting personalized and
detailed feedback.

4
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:14,115
We offer you three options for resume
review related to your work experience,

5
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:18,550
entry level, career change,
and prior industry experience.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,355
Entry level job candidates have zero
to three years of work experience, and

7
00:00:24,355 --> 00:00:27,289
are trying to prove that they're
ready for the workforce.

8
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:29,029
You may or
may not have a college degree.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,813
I had an entry level resume when
I applied my first job at 19.

10
00:00:33,813 --> 00:00:36,876
And I had an entry level resume when
I applied to my first job after

11
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,759
graduating from college years later.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,670
Job candidates who are undergoing
a career change want to showcase their

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,740
previous experiences, even if
unrelated to the job they now want.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,250
They also have to show that they're
serious about their new career

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,140
direction, and that they have
the relevant skills for the job.

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,259
A person who may fit this
profile is a restaurant manager

17
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:59,750
with five years experience,
who wants to become a web developer.

18
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,859
Another person may be a lawyer
with ten years experience,

19
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:05,870
who wants to become a data analyst.

20
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:10,450
Likewise, someone who has worked in IT,
the hardware side of computers,

21
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,380
would be undergoing a career change if
they wanted to be a software engineer.

22
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,257
All three of these people will be
pursuing different roles at different

23
00:01:18,257 --> 00:01:21,480
levels, but their resume order and
structure should be the same.

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,859
[BLANK_AUDIO]

25
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:27,750
Those with prior industry experience
also have a different resume format.

26
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,870
For example, a web developer who also
wants to learn mobile app development,

27
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,689
or a statistician who wants to
shift toward machine learning.

28
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:39,289
It's okay if you don't think you fit
perfectly into one of these categories.

29
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,543
Try out the different guidelines for
each, and see what works for you.

30
00:01:42,543 --> 00:01:44,900
Remember that you are in charge
of your career development.
