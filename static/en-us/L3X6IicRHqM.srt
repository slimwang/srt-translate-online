00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,040
The values for m are 1/8 and 1/2. Nice solving if you found these two

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,436
fractions. We can replace u with what it equaled from our substitution 4m minus

3
00:00:10,436 --> 00:00:17,585
3. So, this u becomes 4m minus 3, and this u becomes 4m minus 3 as well. Next,

4
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:21,987
we add 3 to both sides of the equation to get 4m equals negative 5 halves plus

5
00:00:21,987 --> 00:00:27,522
3, and 4m equals 2. Here I want to combine these two together, so this added

6
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:32,625
together should be positive 1/2. If I haven't convinced you, then think about

7
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:37,279
what we can change 3 into. We can change what this number looks like by writing

8
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:44,053
it as a fraction. 3 is the same as 6 divided by 2. So, really we have negative

9
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:48,816
5 halves, plus 6 halves. We'll have one more positive halve on this side than

10
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:54,440
we do negative halve. So, these added together will give us positive 2 halves.

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,656
Finally, we divide by 4 on both sides of the equations to get m is equal to 1/2

12
00:00:58,656 --> 00:01:04,298
times 1/4, and m is equal to 1/2. I know this is true, since, when we divide by

13
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:10,037
a number, we can really multiply it by its reciporical. So, 1/2 divided by 4 is

14
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:16,146
1/2 times 1/4. And we know that really equals 1/8. So, 1/8 is one solution, and

15
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:18,150
1/2 is the other.
