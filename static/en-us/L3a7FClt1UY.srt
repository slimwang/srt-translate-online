1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,810
Okay, so here's a probability distribution I'm going to define

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,830
for you Michael. You'll notice that it's a probability over

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,640
our Xs. And it's parameterized by theta. So theta is

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,310
going to turn out to stand for threshold. Okay? Got it?

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,350
>> Mmhm.

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:17,850
>> Okay, so here's a probability distribution. It is 1 over z sub theta. For

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,410
all values of x such that the fitness

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,810
function is greater than or equal to theta.

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,900
>> Yeah.

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,840
>> And it's 0 otherwise. So do you understand that?

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,200
>> I think so. So I assume that Z sub

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,430
theta here is, is going to be some kind of normalization factor that

13
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,080
accounts for the probability of landing or choosing an x

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,970
in that space. In the space of high-scoring individuals above threshold.

15
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:44,400
>> That's exactly right. So another way of saying this is that the this

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:51,710
probability is uniform over all values of x whose

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,026
fitness are above some threshold.

18
00:00:53,026 --> 00:00:55,460
>> Yeah so, I'm, I'm, the image I have in my

19
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,700
hand is kind of like a mountain range and if you

20
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,980
put a slice through it then everything that's kind of above

21
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,840
that slice, if we are going to sample uniformly from that, that collection.

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,470
>> That's right. And everything below it, we will simply ignore.

23
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,990
>> Doesn't happen, it doesn't get sampled form.

24
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,390
>> Exactly. Okay so because you demanded it Michael, here's a quiz.

25
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,430
>> [LAUGH] Alright.

26
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,890
>> So,

27
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,160
two questions in this quiz. The first question

28
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,066
is, theta's some threshold and so let's imagine the

29
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:24,920
fitness function has to have some minimum value

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,060
and some maximum value. Okay? And let's call those

31
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,870
theta submin and theta submax respectively. And so I want you to

32
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:38,010
describe in one or two words P sup data

33
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:43,364
min of x. That is the probability distribution whether threshold is its minimum

34
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:46,630
value, and P sup data max of x. That is, the

35
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:50,680
distribution where theta is at it's maximum value. You got it?

36
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,080
>> So, just to, just to be clear,

37
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,190
sort of the maximum meaningful and minimum meaningful values

38
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,280
>> Right.

39
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,930
>> Because I can imagine them, you know, if it's just sort of

40
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,520
way outside the range of the fitness

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,660
function then it's kind of trivial, I guess.

42
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,820
>> Right, well, let's, it is, but let's assume that theta min is the

43
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,660
lowest value that the fitness function can take on and theta max is the largest

44
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,580
value of the fitness function.

45
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,680
>> Okay, yeah, okay, that's how I was imagining it.

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:11,870
>> Okay.

47
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,960
>> Okay, yeah, I'm good to go.

48
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,310
>> Okay. So go!
