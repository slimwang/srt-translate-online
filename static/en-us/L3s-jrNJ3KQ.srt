00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
To answer this, our variable of interest is the difference of these two things

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that has a mean of 10 pounds and its standard deviation is going to be the sum

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
of this standard deviation and this standard deviation.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now we need to find out the standard deviation of this. Since variances add, let's work with those.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So the variance of Treatment B is 400/10,000 and the variance of Treatment A is 100.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So if we evaluate this, this will give us the standard deviation of this number.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And it's 0.2236. So we can see the ratio of this to this.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is much, much greater than the critical value of 1.645.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And so in this case we reject the null hypothesis and therefore accept the alternative.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And there's one particularly interesting feature of these two treatments

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
as they relate to each other.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Just consider how many people lost weight in each case, and post your thoughts to the forums.
