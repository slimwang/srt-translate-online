00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,880
Hey, welcome to the Android
developer nanodegree.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,080
My name's Chris, and I'm a curriculum
manager here at Udacity.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,340
I'm lucky to have worked on some cool
Android devices, like the Nexus,

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,370
and the Samsung Galaxy series.

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,980
More importantly,
I love building mobile products.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,310
They're increasingly more personal,
enrich our lives in so many ways,

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,430
and they even feel a tad magical.

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,140
Now today, I'm super excited to help
you begin your journey to build and

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,720
create your own immersive experiences
for this incredible platform.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,210
Now it's even cooler is we designed this
degree with our friends at Google, so

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,820
you know that you're learning
directly from the experts.

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,090
I think they want to say, hello.

13
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,250
>> Hi.

14
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,590
>> And you learn about Android
as a platform for your ideas and

15
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,200
become aware of the vast canvas of
APIs that will be at your disposal.

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,290
Before you know it, you're writing
code that can reach millions of people

17
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,690
not only on their phones but also on
their tablets, TVs, wearables and

18
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,440
even in their cars and when you finish
the program, you'll be ready to start or

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,840
advance your career as
an Android developer.

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,810
You'll even have a killer
portfolio projects to prove it.

21
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,370
So why don't we go through them.

22
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,743
You'll get your feet wet with an
introductory project that you'll build

23
00:01:02,743 --> 00:01:04,900
in the first week in the nanodegree.

24
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,730
You'll also build an app that helps
users discover the most popular movies

25
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,380
on the web, an optimizer for
both phone and tablet.

26
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,680
Next, you'll take two apps and make them
production ready by adding features like

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,090
Google Cloud Messaging, Air Handling,
widgets, accessibility and localization

28
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,590
support, and a handy one that are
properly used in integrated libraries.

29
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,910
After that,
we timed the superchargeable process

30
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:31,220
using the gridable system to automate
testing, signing, dependency management,

31
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,627
and even configuring your app to
build a free and payed version.

32
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:38,618
Okay, then you're going to focus on
something that's critical to every app,

33
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:41,490
the user experience, something
that we all evaluate visceraly.

34
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,304
You're going to take an existing app and

35
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:47,725
update it using Android's latest
design language, material design.

36
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:51,060
You'll even learn how to extend your
apps to wearables, TV, and the car.

37
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,260
Finally, you'll take everything you
learned from building these projects

38
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,140
to develop a unique app experience
of your own in the Capstone project.

39
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,300
Your app will also draw from Google's
extensive set of mobile services, which

40
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,550
includes things like maps, location and
context, analytics and AdMob.

41
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,680
Here's Miriam to tell you more
about details of the program.

42
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,400
>> Building these
projects won't be easy.

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,770
We are going to challenge you so

44
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,001
that you are prepared to solve tough
problems and think independently.

45
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:21,248
To rise to that challenge, you'll need
to keep up with your learning schedule

46
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:23,126
and engage with your
nanodegree community.

47
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:26,066
Your fellow students are here to
help untangle the trickiest puzzles,

48
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:29,370
get over the biggest hurdles, and
encourage you through all of it.

49
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,430
And when they need help
you'll do the same for them.

50
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,210
The Audacity team will be here
too to deepen your learning,

51
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,470
offer project feedback, and
help you develop professionally.

52
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,810
By leveraging the support systems and
working consistently, you can prepare

53
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,710
yourself for an entirely new stage of
your career in a matter of months.

54
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,080
We can't wait to see where
your nanodegree takes you.
