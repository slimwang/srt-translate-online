1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,510
Wahoo!

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:02,830
Congratulations!

3
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,870
You are just about
done with this course.

4
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,980
In a few moments, you are going to be
introduced to the requirements for

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,860
the final project of the course.

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,800
But, before I get to that,
I want to talk about quizzes.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,200
You've probably noticed that
we like to put a lot of

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,770
quizzes in our courses because
that's just how people learn.

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,090
You're taking this course because
you want to make your apps faster.

10
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,300
So it makes sense for us to give
you a lot of sites to analyze and

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,780
dejankify as you go through the course.

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,910
But of course, not every quiz
involves you debugging apps.

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,440
We also like to pepper in quizzes,
like these, that we hope will give you

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,160
a better conceptual understanding of
what you're trying to accomplish.

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,380
I want to talk about myself for
a second.

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,440
When i started working on
this course with Paul,

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,360
I thought i knew a bit about getting
60 frame per second performance.

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,610
But as we worked together and

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,405
thought through all the questions that
we wanted to ask you, I realized that I

20
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:57,965
really didn't understand frontend
performance as well as I thought.

21
00:00:57,965 --> 00:01:01,465
As any teacher will attest,
you don't really understand a subject

22
00:01:01,465 --> 00:01:04,025
until you try to explain
it to somebody else.

23
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:08,565
In fact, the act of teaching and
deciding what questions to ask is

24
00:01:08,565 --> 00:01:13,210
actually a much better learning exercise
than simply answering questions.

25
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,900
To that end I have a challenge for

26
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,710
you, can you teach this
course better than us?

27
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,728
Think back to the questions
that we asked you and

28
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:22,453
the examples that we
gave you to work on.

29
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:26,040
Do you have an idea for a better
question that could have been asked?

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,480
Or do you have a better app that
people should be debugging?

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,970
Or even better do you think
you can stump Paul and

32
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,810
me with some kind of
performance question?

33
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,860
If so, head back to that
particular part of the course and

34
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,770
post your question in the forums.

35
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,350
And when you do that,
start your post with better question.

36
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,870
There are two big benefits for
asking questions.

37
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,260
You'll be boosting your understanding
of performance by thinking through it

38
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,360
a little bit more deeply and you'll make
the course better for everybody else.

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,820
Future students will practice what
they're learning with more questions and

40
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,690
walk away with a better
understanding of performance.

41
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,970
It's really a win win, so

42
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,230
do you have a better question
than what we've come up with?

43
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,550
If so, post in the forums because I
cannot wait to start answering them.
