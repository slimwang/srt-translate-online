1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,480
So now, we've done 3 main steps towards solving the problem. We understand the

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,206
inputs, we understand the outputs and we understand the relationship between the

3
00:00:08,206 --> 00:00:12,137
two based on some examples. At this point, you might be ready to start coding.

4
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:16,360
But if the problem is a challenging one, you're probably not. What I'll suggest

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,816
in the next step is that you should really think about how to solve the problem

6
00:00:19,816 --> 00:00:22,808
as a human. If you don't understand how to solve the problem yourself in a

7
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:26,050
systematic way, you're probably not ready to start writing the code. So, let's

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,601
think more carefully about how we actually compute this. So, what I would

9
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:33,755
suggest to do next is to try working through a few cases in a very systematic

10
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:37,521
way as a human. And we're going to try a difficult case that covers many of the

11
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:40,382
things that we would need to think about in an algorithm.
