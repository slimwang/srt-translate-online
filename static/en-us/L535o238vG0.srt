We just said that the slope of a line is equal to its increase in the y

2
00:00:04,232 --> 00:00:09,105
direction divided by its increase in the x direction. Here are two new points

3
00:00:09,117 --> 00:00:14,096
that I've drawn for us, 1,7 and 5,3 and I've drawn the line that runs through

4
00:00:14,108 --> 00:00:18,962
both of them. Notice that instead of pointing up and to the right, this line is

5
00:00:18,974 --> 00:00:23,967
pointing down to the right and this affects the slope of this line in some way.

6
00:00:24,076 --> 00:00:28,762
Thinking about that, what can we say about the slope of this line? Is it a

7
00:00:28,774 --> 00:00:33,557
fraction, is it positive, is it negative, is it not defined, or is it zero?
