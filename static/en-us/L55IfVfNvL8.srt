1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, so more SQL.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's start with the basic statement we've been using so far--

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Select * From Links.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's add a Where clause where votes are > 10.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That gives us only the links that have a few votes.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And let's add a new type of clause.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is the Order By clause,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and this says to sort the results.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I've got Select * From Links--we're familiar with that--

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
where Votes is > 10--and we're familiar with that.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Additionally, all of those rows that you're returning to us,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
order them by the number of votes.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And by default, the votes are in ascending order,

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
but if you can't remember that,

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
it's perfectly fine to specify.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You can say ASC for ascending

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
or DESC for descending.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I usually specify because I can never remember which is default.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Pretty simple statement.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
One other thing to note is that the Where clause is not required.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's never required.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So I could change this to look like this.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Just Select * From Links, Order by Votes Descending.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That would give me all of the links sorted descending by votes

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
with no constraints whatsoever.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay, here's a quiz.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We're in the same file, and we're still manipulating our query function.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And what I'd like you to do this time is make the function query,

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
return the IDs of the links that were submitted by user 62443,

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and sort them by submission time ascending.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And remember that a submission time

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
is the column called Submitted_Time.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay, good luck.
