1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,910
So here's the answer. We can do this

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,730
using the find method. What we want to do is

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,740
find in the search string page the target string

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,340
a href. So we can do that with code

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,150
like this. We're going to have start link as

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,700
the variable that we're initializing. That's going to be the

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,355
left side of the assignment. And we're going to set

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:25,670
its value to the result of calling find where

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,840
page is the search string and the target string

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,930
is a href equals. And that will give start link

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,290
the value of a number, which is the position

12
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,090
where the first link tag is found on the page.
