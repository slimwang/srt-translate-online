00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is a very fundamental concept in statistics.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It applies to coin flips and many of the other examples we discussed before.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
A candidate in election might have a true chance that any given voter votes for him.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's call this chance P, the same as the coin flip, and of course if P larger than 0.5 in a 2% run off

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
that person will not initially win in most cases, not always, but as a statistician

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
we can't assess the two chances, so what we do is to form a sample.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In coin flipping, we flip n coins. In elections, we ask n randomly chosen people.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
As we know, this gives us an estimated mean.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It gives us also a variance and therefore, standard deviation.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What's new now is the confidence interval, and the confidence interval is not the same as the variance.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In fact, drop the consideration of a variance.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What this says is based on the outcome, we believe for the parameter Âµ.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is the best guess we can get, which is usually maximum value estimate,

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
but we are not quite certain, so you're going to asses a wider range,

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
in which we believe with high probability that whatever the outcome will be

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
that the outcome will be high probability within this range.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Very often this range is defined as 95% chance that the final outcome falls into this range.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That will take some work to compute. So let's dive in.
