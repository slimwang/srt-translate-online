1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
There's nothing particularly innocuous about this statement.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
X is already in scope. In fact, it's 3, so this is going to assign x to be 4.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I don't think this will prevent us from printing "sindbad".

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This one, though, says x is x divided by 0.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Division by 0 doesn't really make sense

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and will typically cause the Python interpreter to stop and say,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
"You are asking me to do impossible math,"

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and thus not execute subsequent statements.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Assigning x the string value "return" doesn't have the same effect

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
as actually executing a return statement, so this won't help us.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But x = y, well, if this is the entire program,

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
then there is no y in scope, so Python will yell at us and say,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
"Oh, you're referencing an undefined variable."

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So just to make these examples clear, let's actually see it in the interpreter.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This time I've left in x = x + 1, which should not prevent us from seeing Sindbad.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And there he is. But if I print out x = x / 0, no, we don't get Sindbad

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and instead we get this error message from Python,

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah"--the part here at the bottom is the most important--

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
"ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero."

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, we did ask you to do that, so it's our own fault.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Similarly, x = y we don't see Sindbad and instead we see

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
"NameError: global name 'y' is not defined."

23
00:01:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So both of those 2 errors caused us not to see Sindbad.
