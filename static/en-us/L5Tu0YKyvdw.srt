1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,730
Let's look at some more details of this.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,770
What we looked at in the last one, example, was basically an error

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:10,940
function between the expanded minus the original version of the image, and

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,839
we called that a error image, and of course, it's referred to as a Laplacian.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,570
Here, of course, we will refer to as L1 for the first level.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,870
Of course, using this same method we could computer L2.

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,660
The expansion is in essence done by doing this equation here.

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,790
We expand from one level to the other one.

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,678
And then, of course, subtract it from the original to get a Laplacian.

10
00:00:35,678 --> 00:00:37,580
So that's how we computed L1,

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:43,640
we can generalize this to computer L2, L3, L4, and so on.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,220
In essence, what these Ls or these Laplacian images are, again a pyramid.

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,195
Because again, they can be stacked on each other and

14
00:00:51,195 --> 00:00:53,900
of course, they encode in different frequencies.

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:59,120
But there are series of error images that form a Laplacian pyramid.

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,520
And in essence, what they are doing is computing the difference between two

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,560
levels of a Gaussian pyramid.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,721
At one level I got the Gaussian value and

19
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:10,010
I got it at the other level because of, of how I computed it.

20
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,220
And now I can difference it and

21
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,600
actually starts giving me, what was the error between all of them?

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,060
So now let's think about how we can use this information.
