1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,890
Well, we know that the Operating System
keeps track of applications or

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,010
processes that we have on the system.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,360
Because it has to make various resources
available for this processes or

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,300
applications.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,660
So, in addition to if knows on whose
behalf a given application is running.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,550
And when I say that I really mean.

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,270
So the user would launched
this application.

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,170
So the answer to this actually is,
first one,

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,130
processes are going to run on
behalf of users and that users have

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:35,100
to login to the system and launch
this application or these processes.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,282
System, the trusted computing base as
the responsible for complete mediation,

12
00:00:39,282 --> 00:00:44,140
is going to keep track of these
processes as we said before.

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,560
So when a process is going to make
a request, and I keep saying process, or

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,650
application interchangeably,

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,200
an application essentially
runs as a process.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,300
So when the process makes a request,

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,820
the system knows on whose behalf that
process is running and the user on

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,190
whose behalf it's running is somebody
who must have logged in previously.

19
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,940
And after logged in, we had
launched its process for that user.

20
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,710
The resource that is
target of this request,

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,660
we have to keep track of who
all are able to access it.

22
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,420
But when we get to Access Control
we'll discuss how that is done.
