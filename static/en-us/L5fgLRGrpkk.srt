1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,260
For the first one we'll get 1 plus 11i, and for the second one we'll get 3 plus

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,600
5i. Great effort if you found those two answers. For the sum we can drop the

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,442
parentheses since we're not multiplying anything. Then we just add the real

4
00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:19,196
numbers together to get 4 minus 3 which equals 1. For the imaginary numbers we

5
00:00:19,196 --> 00:00:23,672
have 6i and 5i, and that sums to 11i. Don't make the mistake of adding these

6
00:00:23,672 --> 00:00:28,300
two together to get 12i. Remember this i represents the square root of negative

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,268
1 so these are not like terms. This is a real number and this is an imaginary

8
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:36,632
number. When we subtract this complex number we want to distribute this

9
00:00:36,632 --> 00:00:40,728
negative 1 to each term this means positive 4 becomes negative 4 and negative

10
00:00:40,728 --> 00:00:46,200
2i becomes positive 2i. Now, we're ready to add our real numbers together and

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,845
our imaginary numbers together. We'll have 7 minus 4, which equals 3, and 3i

12
00:00:50,845 --> 00:00:57,700
plus 2i, which equals 5i. This gives us our final result of 3 plus 5i. Well

13
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:57,874
done.
