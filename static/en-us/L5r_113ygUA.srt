00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,560
For this quiz, I'm going to list some decisions and

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,540
you tell me what architectural style it might apply to. Don't worry,

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,160
it's a fairly commonly used architectural style. For this particular kind of

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,560
system, we're going to have software components that are physically separated,

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,070
that means on different machines. Some of the components are there to

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,500
request services from other components that provide those services. By so

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,020
doing, this allows for scaling. In the situation where the number of requests

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:33,230
grows over time. We're going to have that the service providers are unaware of

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,560
the identities of the service requesters unless those,

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,240
service requesters provide that identity information. We're going to in this

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,212
particular architectural style it isolates the requesters from each other.

12
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:51,970
They're aware of the service provider or providers but not each other and

13
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,140
we're even going to allow for multiple service providers the number of

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,480
which may grow dynamically depending upon the demand for

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,270
the services that are there. Can you name this particular architectural style?
