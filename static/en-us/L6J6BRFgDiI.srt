00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:04,390
All right, so let's recast this conversation in terms of purity.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,520
Say I have two splits that are available to me.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,390
I can split based on bumpiness or split based on the speed limit.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,940
And then let's say I'm only going to look at one of the halves.

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,630
I'm going to look, compare this half to this half.

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,360
Which one of these two sets of examples has more purity in terms of

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,280
being all of one class label or the other?

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,650
