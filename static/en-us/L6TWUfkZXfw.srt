1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,140
Okay so we're going to do that.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,370
And I want you to figure out what would
happen if we got all the way down to

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,210
step five and
A is let's say, the mother.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,250
>> Okay.
>> So what would happen step five?

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,030
>> A gets the baby.

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:13,880
>> A gets the baby.

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,149
>> A pays B and B pays F.

8
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,860
So F is basically a penalty to B for
lying.

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,460
>> Right.
And A [LAUGH] is worth the penalty to A.

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:33,810
But it should be, well, it depends on
how much B sets the value of V for.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,912
>> Right, so,
what would B set the value of V for?

12
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:37,140
What are the possibilities?

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,189
Okay, it could be like,
1 million dollars, right?

14
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:43,550
So that would definitely
discourage A from saying yes.

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,382
>> Okay, so I say you pick the million
dollars because you think a million

16
00:00:46,382 --> 00:00:48,840
dollars is more than the value
of the baby to the real mother?

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,590
That the idea here?

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,690
>> [LAUGH] Yeah, I guess so.

19
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,250
>> Okay, so
some value of V greater than V real.

20
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:53,850
>> Okay.

21
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,360
>> Which for
the sake of this discussion,

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,350
let's say is 1 million dollars.

23
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,520
>> Okay, excellent.

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,580
>> So, I'm going to claim
that B would never do that.

25
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,990
>> B would never?

26
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,900
So the disincentive for B for
that is that A can be like,

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,070
you know what I can't afford
a baby at a million dollars.

28
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,040
It's more than the actual
value of my baby to me.

29
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,720
You get the baby, but you're going to
have to pay the million dollars.

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,910
>> Right, now, that's not just
something that could happen,

31
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,161
that's something that
would happen right?

32
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:20,463
>> Right.
>> Because we've tied

33
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:21,767
everything up in the value.

34
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:25,760
So if V Is bigger than V real, then we
get down here and ask is it your child?

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,130
A will say no because paying V for

36
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,220
the baby is more than
what the baby is worth.

37
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,060
And so B will get the baby,
but B will pay V.

38
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,360
What do we know about V?

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,380
V is bigger than V real, which
means it's also bigger than V fake.

40
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,050
>> Got it.

41
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,700
So okay, so we're assuming
that B has a value of B fake.

42
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,340
>> Right.

43
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,697
>> So-
>> Well in this case we're assuming

44
00:01:46,697 --> 00:01:48,740
A was the real mother and B was not.

45
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,140
>> A was the real mother and B was not.

46
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,010
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

47
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,940
>> That's what I said, right?

48
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,530
So B has a value of V fake.

49
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,060
So then what value of V would B pick?

50
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,728
>> So, B shouldn't be willing,
I mean B doesn't want the baby for

51
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:02,740
more than V fake.

52
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,720
That's how much B values the baby.

53
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,820
And if B suggests a value of V or
announces a value of V in step 3,

54
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,560
that's bigger than V fake,
B might get, you know, B is at risk.

55
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,220
>> Right.

56
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,060
>> Right, if getting the baby and
overpaying for it.

57
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,510
>> Right, and
having to pay more of this.

58
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,600
>> Economists are weird.

59
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,467
>> Economists are weird.

60
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:22,750
But that's okay.

61
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,820
So that means that not only will B not
pick something bigger than V real,

62
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,260
V would not pick anything
bigger than V fake.

63
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,010
>> Yeah, and in fact,

64
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:35,430
in principle, B would rather pay
up to V fake to get the baby.

65
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,350
Anything less than that and if B doesn't
get the baby, B.'s going to be sad for

66
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,870
not having offered more.

67
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,550
So at the end of the day,
B's going to pick V fake as V.

68
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,380
Okay so if B picks V fake as B, then
what do we know is going to happen at

69
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,570
this question,
when A gets asked if it's your child?

70
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,190
A's going to say yes.

71
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,330
>> A is going to say yes.

72
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,560
>> Why?
>> Well because if the value that B

73
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,170
announced is V fake and A would have
regret for not getting the baby,

74
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,450
yeah, for not getting the baby, and
not bidding up to V real, no, bidding is

75
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,570
probably not the right word, but let's
go with it kind of suggesting it, or

76
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,550
being it, A would have been willing
to pay up to V real for the baby.

77
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,140
So A would be happy to pay V fake for
the baby.

78
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,420
>> because V fake's less than V real.

79
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,350
>> Yeah, so A will, in fact, say yes.

80
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,680
A will get the baby,
will pay less than the value for it.

81
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,720
And what happens to B?

82
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,080
>> What happens to be B?

83
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,110
B pays a nominal fine.

84
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,560
>> Right, but that's greater than 0.

85
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,530
>> So if they both thought this all
the way through, now we can unroll back

86
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,090
all the way to step 2 where B is asked,
is this your child?

87
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,390
Now B is saying, I could say no and
A gets the baby and I just walk away.

88
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,200
>> I get zero.

89
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,830
>> Or I could say yes and
I'm going to end up paying a fine.

90
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,730
>> Right.

91
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,770
>> But least A is going to have
to pay a lot of money, so ha.

92
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,270
>> But it's all built into
the value here,all right.

93
00:03:54,270 --> 00:04:00,230
So that means that since B is never
going to be willing to assert a V

94
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,990
greater than V fake, which means that B
is never going to be able to make it so

95
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,980
expensive that the real
mother would say no,

96
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,170
B has no reason to ever let it get this
far, because B will pay something.

97
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,250
B will get minus F,
which is less than 0,

98
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,420
which means if we ever get to step 2,
B will bail and say no.

99
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:18,920
>> I see.
