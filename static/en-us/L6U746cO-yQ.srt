00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,848
The way the GPU, usually solves the visibility problem, is by using what is

2
00:00:04,848 --> 00:00:09,450
called a Z buffer or if you have British meanings, it is pronounced zed buffer.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,212
The artist Lennart Anderson once said, landscape painting is really just a box

4
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:16,803
of air with little marks in it telling you how far back in that air things are,

5
00:00:16,803 --> 00:00:20,508
it's not the[UNKNOWN] of quotes, but this is a pretty good description of the Z

6
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:25,024
buffer algorithm. The Z in the Z buffer stands for distance from the camera.

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:29,578
Buffer is just another word for a data array like an image. So, for the image,

8
00:00:29,578 --> 00:00:33,484
in addition to storing a color at each pixel we also store a distance which is

9
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:37,792
called the z-depth. The z-depth is often considered as a floating point number

10
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:42,082
that ranges from 0, meaning close to the eye to 1, meaning the maximum distance

11
00:00:42,082 --> 00:00:45,854
from the eye. The z-buffer is initially cleared by filling O with 1s.
