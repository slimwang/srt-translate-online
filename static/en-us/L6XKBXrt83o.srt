00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The last question we're going to talk about today came from Elise.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And Elise got really excited by the discussion that Wes was having

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
with the CTO of Mozilla.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
She wants to know how do you create a programming language?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What goes into it?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Well, the good news is that's what we're doing in this course.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We just happen to be creating all the materials needed

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to interpret and run programming language that exists,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and that is JavaScript, and interpret html,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
which is just how to display something.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But that's how you build a programming language--

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
exactly what we're doing in this course.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The only difference is that you would change the syntax

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and all the features to how you would want it in a language of your choosing.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But this is the course, and I hope by the end

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
you'll get a very clear picture of what would go into doing such a thing.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
All right, well, thank you for your answers, Peter.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And thank you all for your questions.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Thank you, as well. And thank you for being here, Andy.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Thanks to everyone. >>Everyone gets thanks.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
See you next week.
