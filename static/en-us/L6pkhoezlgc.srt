1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,866
Let's review. We started off with a context-free grammar. That's a rule of the form,

2
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:16,532
"VP goes to V NP NP." That's the kind of technology that's used in your grammars for programming languages.

3
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:23,232
And then we moved to a probabilistic, context-free grammar by adding on a probability,

4
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:28,432
and we put it in parentheses to the right, but let's be more clear about exactly what we're doing.

5
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:36,399
We're saying, "What's the probability of this rule, given that the left-hand side of the rule is VP?"

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,599
And we said that was equal to .2.

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:48,432
Now, the next step is to go and add lexicalization, so we have a lexicalized, probabilistic, context-free grammar.

8
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:54,666
So in a lexicalized, probabilistic, context-freeÂ grammar, we deal not with the categories of the left-hand side,

9
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:59,132
but rather with specific words. And there's multiple ways you can do that.

10
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:08,032
And one way we can do it is say, "What's the probability that a verb phrase is a verb followed by two noun phrases?"

11
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:11,999
And we're going to condition that on what the actual verb is.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,832
If the verb is "gave," then there should be a relatively high probability.

13
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:26,132
You said, "He gave me the money," a direct and indirect object. That's fairly common for "gave."

14
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:33,432
So maybe that's .25 or something. And compare that to the same rule where the verb is said.

15
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:43,699
Normally, the verb "said" either has a single object, "He said something," but it doesn't normally have two objects.

16
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,499
It would be rare to say, "He said me something." In colloquial, it may occur.

17
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,032
"I said me my piece." But we're going to put down a very low probability for that.

18
00:01:54,033 --> 00:02:01,332
If we had a tree bank we could figure out how low it is. But I'm just going to estimate it's something like .0001.

19
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:07,332
In a dictionary, they'll give you these probabilities, but they'll give them in absolute terms,

20
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:12,366
in that they'll tell you whether verbs are transitive or intransitive.

21
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:19,132
So for example, what's the probability that a verb phrase consists of just a verb?

22
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:27,799
Versus that the verb phrase consists of a verb followed by a noun phrase, given that the verb is "quake"?

23
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,332
Well, I can put down some numbers here, but if I look in my dictionary, I get a clue.

24
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:38,299
So my dictionary says that "quake" is an intransitive verb.

25
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,399
And so that means the dictionary is claiming that this probability should be zero.

26
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,332
And this probability should be something higher. Now, unfortunately, if we go out and look at the actual world,

27
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,499
it turns out that "quake" is not always intransitive.

28
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:01,832
If you do a web search for "quaked the earth," I get back 20,000 results. Now, not all of those are valid sentences;

29
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:07,966
Some of them are those words just happen to be together in a non-sentence context, a list of words or something.

30
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:13,666
But you can see thousands of sentences where "quake" is used transitively.

31
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:20,032
And so this shouldn't be a zero. Maybe it should be a .0001 or something.

32
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:27,599
But the dictionaries are too Boolean, too logical, too willing to give you a precise answer,

33
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,166
when language is really much more complex than that.

34
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:34,032
And so these lexicalized grammars come closer to giving you what you need.

35
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:38,499
Now, we still haven't gone all the way to solving our telescope problem.

36
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:49,266
For that, we want to be able to say, "What's the probability of noun phrase going to noun phrase followed by prepositional phrase?"

37
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:57,532
Or, "What's the probability of a verb phrase going to a verb followed by a noun phrase, followed by a prepositional phrase?"

38
00:03:57,533 --> 00:04:05,032
And we want to do that in the case of the verb, if the verb equals "saw," and then if we're also dealing with a case where

39
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:15,699
the noun phrase has a head, meaning the main verb is equal to "man" and the preposition phrase has "with" and "telescope."

40
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:26,999
And then compare that to the probability for when the head of the noun phrase is "man" and the preposition has "with" and "telescope."

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:36,366
Now, these probabilities may be hard to get, because they're conditioning on quite a lot, on three very specific words on the right-hand side.

42
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:40,332
And so it may be hard to estimate these, and we may need some model that backs off,

43
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:49,766
that says maybe we don't look exactly for the word "man," but rather we look for something which represents an animate person.

44
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:56,032
And so just as we had in previous models when we talked about how to do smoothing and how to back off

45
00:04:56,033 --> 00:05:00,732
to a more general case, we can do that in these lexicalized models as well.

46
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:07,232
But the point is that we want to make these choices based on probabilities, and we get these probabilities

47
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:16,132
by looking at our model, doing an analysis, and informing that analysis from data that we get from the tree banks.

48
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:22,566
We can put that all together, then we can make these choices and we can come up with the right interpretation of sentences,

49
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:28,267
and do the disambiguation, and figure out which one is more probable.
