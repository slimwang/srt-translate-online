1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,180
These are the attributes
that we care about.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,660
You might be wondering
why time is not included.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,750
The weather API provides the date and

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,380
GMT time, but doesn't provide
time zones for the location.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,820
So unfortunately, the date could be
incorrect in some cases depending on

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,900
your location and time of day.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,570
Instead, for

8
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,200
a more accurate experience, we'll be
computing the date ourselves based on

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,150
the device time of when you fetched
the weather forecast from the server.
