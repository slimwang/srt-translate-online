00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,670
It's important to note that the research
you conduct with your prototype

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,980
doesn't have to be complicated,
but it does have to be effective.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,070
To be effective,

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,580
your research needs to answer whatever
questions you ask at the beginning.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,100
This was a great insight shared by Tomer
Sharon in the product design course.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,460
So what questions are those?

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,530
The stage or fidelity your prototype is
in will determine the type of feedback

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,730
you ask for and
the type of questions you ask.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,050
First, it's easier to get good
information from qualitative questions

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,450
rather than quantitative questions.

11
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,430
For example, if you're presenting
a low fidelity prototype,

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,620
you're probably just going to want
to ask very high level questions,

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,530
such as, can a user easily learn and
use this app?

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,275
However, if you're presenting
a prototype that includes

15
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:49,800
microinteractions and is reflective of
the finished product, you'll probably

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,480
want to ask questions such as,
how does this animation feel to you?

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,080
Do the interactions get in the way of or
improve the experience?

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,190
Your goals are entirely different at
that stage since you're moving to more

19
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,680
of a finished product.

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,040
I've put a list of useful
questions to ask and answer for

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,380
each kind of prototype in
the instruction notes below the video.

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,530
These questions will get you feedback.

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,310
Valuable feedback is any
feedback that combines a specific

24
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,430
part of the prototype.

25
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,780
With a positive or negative
feeling on the part of the user.

26
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,580
For instance,

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,890
a user reporting that they are confused
by the menu is very valuable feedback,

28
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,650
as is a user being excited at how
quickly they can achieve their goal.

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,065
Specific suggestions can be helpful
feedback, but are often not useful until

30
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:33,240
you're working on very
high fidelity prototypes.

31
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,330
When you're first
recording users' feedback,

32
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,520
make sure to keep all
of it that you can.

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,110
We'll talk later on about how
to go about doing this, and

34
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,690
about what permission you
need from your users.

35
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,280
At the end of the lesson,
you'll be looking for

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,860
patterns in the feedback from
various users on the same prototype.

37
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,370
So detailed records are vital.
