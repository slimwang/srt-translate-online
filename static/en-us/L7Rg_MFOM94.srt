00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,215
>> We know the companies cost the same, at five hours, and the cost is $60. This

2
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:10,723
also makes sense because this is our point of intersection. It's the point that

3
00:00:10,723 --> 00:00:15,946
makes both of these equations true. If x were equal to 5 we could plug that in

4
00:00:15,946 --> 00:00:21,250
here. 6 times 5 is 30 plus 30 would be $60 in total. That would be the cost for

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,970
Rent-a-Car. For Car-nival we could also plug 5 in for x. 5 times 10 would be 50

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,774
plus 10 would be 60. So yes, this point is the solution or the intersection for

7
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:34,202
the two equations.
