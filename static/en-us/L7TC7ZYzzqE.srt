1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,230
So, back to our overall
reducing the AMAT.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,680
We've seen some techniques
to reduce the hit time.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,820
We've seen techniques to
reduce the miss rate.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,180
We've seen a technique for

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,690
reducing the miss penalty which
is to overlap multiple misses.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,100
And we will now see a technique
called multi-level caches, or

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,710
having a cache hierarchy
instead of just one cache.

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,030
With this technique, a miss in the first
cache of the processor accesses,

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,130
which is called now a level one cache,

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,020
will just go to another
cache instead of memory.

11
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,750
So now, the miss penalty from
our level one cache is not

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,720
equal to the memory latency.

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,270
The miss penalty in level one
cache now is the hit time

14
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,710
of the level two cache plus when
the level two cache misses,

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,440
then it's going to be level two miss
rate times the level two miss penalty.

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,780
And this level two miss penalty can be
the actual memory latency but we can

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,467
have a level three cache and if we miss
there, a level four cache and so on.
