1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,980
Before any business
problem can be solved,

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,020
it's important to know what data is
needed, and what data's available.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,590
The second step in the framework
is understanding the data.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,940
Having a mental model of the business
issue will be helpful in determining

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,980
what factors are likely
to drive demand tomorrow.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,350
For example, some factors that
are likely to be important

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,830
are the day of the week,
as well as the month and the year.

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,670
It'll also to be useful to
know the hour of the day and

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,660
the temperature at that hour, and
maybe even the preceding hour.

10
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,400
So we're trying to predict
electricity usage, but

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,930
don't know what the temperature
will be tomorrow.

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,690
We'll need to make predictions about
the temperature at any given hour.

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,650
Now that we have some ideas around our
data needs, we can start to explore data

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,320
factors that will help us
predict hourly temperatures.

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,435
In this scenario,
we may look at the forecasted high and

16
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:53,307
low temperatures from
the national weather service.

17
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:56,479
The number of minutes from
sunrise to start of each hour,

18
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,730
and the temperature for
the same hour of the previous day.

19
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,599
The available data will be important
citing the types of methodologies that

20
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,250
may be used.

21
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,870
Additionally, a solid understanding
of the data is important

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,030
to ensure proper analysis.

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,495
For example, if you have a data field
that shows the number of employees per

24
00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:18,795
month, it may be important to know if
the value represents the number of

25
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:21,837
employees at the beginning of the month,
at the end of the month.

26
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:24,563
Or, the average of the number of
employees at the beginning and

27
00:01:24,563 --> 00:01:26,170
end of the month.

28
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,910
An improper understanding of the data
may result in an incorrect analysis.
