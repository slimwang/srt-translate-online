1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And here's my implementation for the cancerous case.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You don't have to plug in the measurement probability to see a negative test result,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
which is one minus the sensitivity and in the normalizer,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
we copy the first term over in the second term of the noncancer hypothesize.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
we just put in the specificity and when you put this all together and run the procedure,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
we indeed get 0.013698 and so on.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the number I gave you for the first example.
