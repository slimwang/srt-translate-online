1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,193
As you can see, there are many different
types of resources available to you.

2
00:00:04,193 --> 00:00:07,689
So it's important to have a way of
determining whether a particular

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:09,050
resource should be used.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,826
Here are three things you want to
consider before deciding to rely on

5
00:00:12,826 --> 00:00:14,028
a resource for help.

6
00:00:14,028 --> 00:00:19,371
One, is it up to date, software
versions are constantly changing.

7
00:00:19,371 --> 00:00:22,405
Two, is it accurate, or in other words,

8
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:27,803
is the person providing the information
knowledgeable enough to trust.

9
00:00:27,803 --> 00:00:31,445
Three, is it relevant?

10
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:35,143
This one can be difficult, especially
when you're just starting out.

11
00:00:35,143 --> 00:00:40,266
The resources you find may not exactly
match up with what you're trying to do.

12
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:44,306
In that case, you may need to do more
research to verify that it can be used

13
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:45,650
to solve your problem.
