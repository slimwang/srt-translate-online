00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:05,049
Let us do another exercise. This is actually an exercise we've come

2
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:08,770
across earlier, however this exercise has an interesting property.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:14,600
Often the world presents input to us, for which there is no one single right

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,960
answer. Instead, there are multiple answers that could be right.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,591
The world is ambiguous. So, here we again have A is to B, C is to D, and

6
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:27,670
we have six choices. So, what choice do you think is the right choice here?
