00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,960
As humans, we have evolved such that we're able to be aware of both our

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:09,530
internal world and our external world. This is what we mean by consciousness.

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,306
And we vary in our level of awareness and arousal throughout the day from when

4
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:17,752
we wake to when we sleep. Sleep is vital for healthy functioning, both

5
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:22,230
physiologically and psychologically. It allows our body to restore itself after

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,946
a long day of activity. In addition, sleep aids us in memory consolidation and

7
00:00:26,946 --> 00:00:32,258
it helps us learn. Dreaming that occurs during REM Sleep also assists in brain

8
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:37,597
growth and development. Humans have a long history of taking psychoactive drugs

9
00:00:37,597 --> 00:00:42,066
to change their consciousness. And we have many reasons why we take drugs

10
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:45,970
including recreational, social, spiritual, and medical or psychological

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,883
reasons. Depressants like the barbiturates, benzodiazepines and alcohol,

12
00:00:51,883 --> 00:00:56,891
depress central nervous system activity. Therefore, they can cause relaxation,

13
00:00:56,891 --> 00:01:03,760
and decrease anxiety. Opiates are very effective in treating pain. Stimulants

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,325
like cocaine and methamphetamine increase sympathetic nervous system activity.

15
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:12,249
Cannabis has been used medicinally. But it can also cause perceptual

16
00:01:12,249 --> 00:01:17,806
distortions. The hallucinogens like LSD and psilocybin produce profound changes

17
00:01:17,806 --> 00:01:22,828
in perception. Finally, although MDMA is also used recreationally, it is

18
00:01:22,828 --> 00:01:28,398
showing promise as a new treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.

19
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:32,193
Psychoactive drugs produce their effects by interacting with receptors, such as

20
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:36,694
dopamine and serotonin receptors. And they mimic our naturally-occurring

21
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:40,565
substances produced by the brain, such as our endorphins.
