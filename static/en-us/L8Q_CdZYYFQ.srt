1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,690
Now, the general form of what we've been seeing is called the Remainder

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,712
Theorem. Over all, the remainder theorem tells us that the remainder we'll get

3
00:00:07,712 --> 00:00:12,870
when we divide a function f by x minus a is going to be equal to f of a.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,530
Exactly what we get when we plug in a for the value of x into the function.

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,820
Now, their remainder actually has really interesting implications for graphs.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,395
We'll see that when we let a function equal the division of two polynomials and

7
00:00:25,395 --> 00:00:30,348
their remainder is not equal to zero we get some pretty cool graphs. We'll end

8
00:00:30,348 --> 00:00:33,476
up seeing things like this. The remainder's instantly involved in the way that

9
00:00:33,476 --> 00:00:37,223
the curve breaks into these different pieces. We'll come back to that later,

10
00:00:37,223 --> 00:00:39,469
though. We don't need to worry about this for now.
