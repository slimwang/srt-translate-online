1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
For this problem we have a function clique,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and we want to know how many units of time does it take to execute clique(4).

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
To count the time, count each print statement as 1 unit

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and count each time range is evaluated as 1 unit.
