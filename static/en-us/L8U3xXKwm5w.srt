1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,500
That ends the lesson.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,990
I was about to say that ends
the lesson on Luke's flow.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,610
That's pretty much true.

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,790
It's only a little bit of a lie because
we're going to see a little bit more

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,440
of this derivative motion stuff in the,
in the next lesson.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,280
But basically what we did is we solved
for a different flow at every point

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,920
by assuming that a window over that
point had a particular flow everywhere.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,400
Then we move the window a little bit,
and now we pretend that

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,250
in this new window, the flow might be
something different, even though those

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,670
windows overlap, which is a little
strange but, but that's how you do it.

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,470
So it's okay to have small
errors along the way like that.

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,190
But the idea, so there's a little
bit of a contradiction here, right?

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,060
In fact that contradiction
is in what I just said.

14
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,960
We assume that a window is all
moving the same way around a point,

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,960
and we assign that value to that point,
then we move the window a little bit and

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,780
we throw away that last thing,
and we say we're

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,120
going to assign it to the next point
even though those windows overlap.

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,980
You might say,

19
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to carve the image up into
sort of coherently moving patches.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,440
And so, there's two parts of that.

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,060
There's this notion of how
do I do the carving up.

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,000
And what do you mean
by coherently moving?

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,140
And what that means is you've
got a model for the motion

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,620
inside these regions, and the next
lesson will talk about motion models and

25
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,720
how we could find regions that behave
according to some motion model.
