1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,330
So why don’t you in this unit look at a field

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,043
example, if we are applying statistical techniques

3
00:00:06,043 --> 00:00:08,712
for problems of important significance in stock

4
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:13,227
trading. So here is a stock price for a specific

5
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:16,758
day in 2010 and the company we’re discussing

6
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:19,643
is Apple, which on the day started trading just

7
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:23,482
above $250 but in the afternoon the stock went

8
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,713
all of a sudden down to $200, back to the

9
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:28,351
original price. As a statistician, we are

10
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:31,156
concerned about this, because if we make trading

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,561
decisions based on what’s happening, we might

12
00:00:33,561 --> 00:00:36,131
lose millions or billions of dollars.

13
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:40,734
This is a one in a decade abnormal behavior

14
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:43,331
and as a statistician, we might care about

15
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:45,307
writing software that finds these kind of

16
00:00:45,307 --> 00:00:47,498
behaviors, so we stop trading and we don’t

17
00:00:47,498 --> 00:00:50,493
fall into the trap of selling our stock at a

18
00:00:50,493 --> 00:00:53,330
unfortunate rate just because something really,

19
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,636
really strange is happening. And that’s a real

20
00:00:55,636 --> 00:00:58,219
example, in which have lost millions if not

21
00:00:58,219 --> 00:00:59,073
billions of dollars.

22
00:00:59,874 --> 00:01:02,586
So on a typical trading day, Apple stock traded

23
00:01:02,586 --> 00:01:08,671
about 70,000 times, giving us 70,000 data points

24
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:11,391
of prices during the day. What we’d be looking

25
00:01:11,391 --> 00:01:13,817
at is the percentage change between adjacent

26
00:01:13,817 --> 00:01:16,504
trades, which we call Delta T and this defined

27
00:01:16,504 --> 00:01:20,209
as the difference between two consecutive trading

28
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:26,064
points, XT plus one minus XT normalized by XT.

29
00:01:26,064 --> 00:01:28,921
So normally if XT and XT plus one is the same,

30
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:31,932
this will be zero. If there is a big difference

31
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:34,507
then this is a larger value and we know for the

32
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:37,058
day in question what the mean and the standard

33
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:40,133
deviation is for this percentage change. The

34
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:45,561
mean is as small as 0.00074 negative in percent,

35
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:47,136
so if we leave off the percent it’s even a

36
00:01:47,136 --> 00:01:49,836
hundred times smaller and this is the value

37
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:53,748
for the standard deviation, 0.01344 percent.

38
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:56,149
My first question for you is, to compute the

39
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,364
confidence interval, assuming that we can use

40
00:01:58,364 --> 00:02:01,240
a confidence interval to detect outliers in

41
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,131
the data. If you assume a symmetrical confidence

42
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:06,524
interval with five percent confidence, in our

43
00:02:06,524 --> 00:02:09,910
magic factor that percentile is 1.96; compute

44
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,729
for me in percent the confidence interval

45
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:15,000
for the variable Delta T.
