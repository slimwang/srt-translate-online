1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,008
So the question is,
we always talk about privacy hawks,

2
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:08,150
who are really concerned,
sort of paranoid about their privacy.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,000
Then, sort of the people who
don't care about privacy.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,220
And in between there may
be the privacy pragmatists.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,740
So, this is not a question,
didn't say do you care about privacy?

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,190
But it did care about how important
do you think is that you'd be able to

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,830
control information about you,
that you would consider private?

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,970
So, what percentage of
the people who responded to this

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,410
question do you think thought
that this is quite important,

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,920
that they be able to control
information about them?
