1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So now we're almost there. We've defined the problem.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We've defined how the game works,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and we're ready to write the optimal strategy--

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the best possible strategy for Pig, and I'll let you finish it off.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We'll call this function "max_wins"--

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the strategy function that maximizes the number of wins--

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
--at least the number of expected wins--

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and go ahead and write your code there,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and you can write it in terms of the functions we've defined above

10
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and in terms of a call to best action.
