Thinks Mora. Let's get back to our scatter plot of

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,580
friend count versus age. It might be appealing to further

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,500
summarize the relationship of age and friend count. Rather than

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,300
having the four extra layers of geom line, we could try

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,870
to summarize the strength of this relationship in a single

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,220
number. Often, analyst will use a correlation coefficient to summarize this,

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,540
now, if you're not familiar with correlation, you should review

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,960
the links in the instructor notes. We've even included some practice

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,910
from Stat 95, that's our statistics course. We're going to

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,980
use the Pearson product moment correlation, noted with a

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,260
lower case r, to measure the linear relationship between

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,100
age and friend count What I want you to

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,265
do is to look up the documentation for the

14
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:43,960
core.test function. Figure out how to find Pearson's r

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,330
using any two variables. What's the correlation between age

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,630
and friend count? Round your answer to three decimal places.
