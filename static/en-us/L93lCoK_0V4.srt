00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,750
So for this exercise,
I won't tell you exactly how to fix it.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,300
Less hand-holding,
like Katherine wanted.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,700
This will be a chance for you to
figure out what the problem is and

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,750
what the potential solution is.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,140
I'd like you to examine the code and
answer these questions.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,260
First, what's wrong with
the PhraseActivity and

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,700
why do you think that's happening?

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,660
Go ahead and write your answer here.

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,920
Second, describe how we should modify
our code to fix that problem, so

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,050
that our app looks like this for the
numbers activity and looks like this for

11
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,720
the phrases activity.

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,990
There's no need to write
the actual code here.

13
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,010
Just describe your approach but
be as specific as you can so

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,180
that you can easily translate those
ideas into code in the next step.

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,120
If you need some hints,
check out the notes below the quiz.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,270
Don't worry about the spacing and
visual appearance of the app for now.

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,590
We'll take care of
those in a later step.
