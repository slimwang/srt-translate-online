00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,780
Now before I write the action for

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:07,470
this button, in this new ViewController, let's do a quick review of MVC.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,060
So we currently have two scenes in our app.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,290
In the first scene, we have a view with several buttons.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,630
This view is controlled by a class called ViewController.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,840
And this class inherits from UIViewController.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,230
The second scene has a view which currently has just a simple button.

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,620
This view is controlled by another view controller that we made.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,200
I want you to think about the name of this view controller, and

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,980
enter it in this box.

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,215
By the way, this view controller also inherits from UIViewController.
