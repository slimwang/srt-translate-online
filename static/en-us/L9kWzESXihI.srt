00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,386
Here the solution is 8 plus 7i, and here the solution is 3 plus 7i. Great work

2
00:00:05,386 --> 00:00:08,923
if you figured those two out. We're really adding these two complex numbers

3
00:00:08,923 --> 00:00:12,354
together, so we can drop the parentheses. Next, I want to combine my real parts

4
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:17,731
and my imaginary parts. I know addition is commutative, so I can rewrite this

5
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:26,100
line as 2 plus 6 plus 3i plus 4i, 2 plus 6 equals 8 And 3i plus 4i equals 7i.

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,170
Remember I represents the square root of negative 1. So we have 3 square roots

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,750
of negative 1 and 4 square roots of negative 1. That gives us a total of 7

8
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,310
square roots of negative 1 or just 7i. When we subtract a complex number, we

9
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:45,530
want to distribute this negative 1 to each of the terms. So we'll have negative

10
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,160
3 plus 2i. Then we combine the real parts of 6 and negative 3 and combine the

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,458
imaginary parts of 5i and 2i. This gives us a total of 3 plus 7i. Our final

12
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,293
result.
