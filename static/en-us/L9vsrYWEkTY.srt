00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,880
To understand where in our view controller we can write this code,

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,939
we need to investigate our class.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,930
You will notice that it inherits from another class called UIViewController,

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,050
which is a class Apple wrote for managing views.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,630
Let me unpack this relationship with the help of a diagram.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,480
So we know that the view in our app comprises of things like buttons and

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,280
labels, and that this view is controlled or

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,370
managed by a file called ViewController.Swift.

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,660
Now this file has a class in it by the same name.

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,320
And this class inherits from UIViewController.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,220
UIViewController has several functions defined within it that we also inherit.

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,790
One of them is called viewDidLoad.

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,710
This is called when our view is first created.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,860
This function is great for

15
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,640
any initial setup, or any one time only work that we want to do in our app.

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,156
By the way, if you go back to the code,

17
00:00:51,156 --> 00:00:55,170
you will notice that there is a skeletal version of this method viewDidLoad,

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,970
which was created when we first made our project.

19
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,440
Another function we inherit is called ViewWillAppear.

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,069
This function is called right before the view appears to the user.

21
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,210
And it's a great place for showing and hiding different things on our screen.

22
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,150
Next on the list is viewDidAppear.

23
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,440
This function is called right after the view appears to the user and

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,030
is a great place for starting any animations.

25
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,220
There are a few more functions like this.

26
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,350
Two of them are viewWillDisappear and viewDidDisappear.

27
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,540
I've added a link in the instructor notes that provides more details about

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,810
all of these.

29
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,920
By the way, don't take my word for the existence of any of these functions.

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,850
Let's go back to Xcode and check for documentation.

31
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,320
Here, I can press and hold the Option key on my keyboard.

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,550
And then click on UIViewController, to get some documentation on this class.

33
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,700
If you actually want to see the code inside this class UIViewController,

34
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,950
what you can do is press and

35
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,140
hold Cmd on your keyboard, and then click on the class name.

36
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,600
Xcode will now show you the code inside of UIViewController.

37
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Here, you can check to see all of the methods inside UIViewController,

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,210
like viewDidLoad, viewWillAppear, and the rest.

39
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,920
Once you are done reading through this code,

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,820
you can go back to your own class by clicking this back button here.

41
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,380
Okay, so here I am at the question I asked previously.

42
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,780
Now that we know a little bit more about these functions that run at different

43
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,390
times in the life of a view, let's think about this question one more time.

44
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,100
If you wanted to write this piece of code to hide the Stop button,

45
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,350
which method would you write this in?
