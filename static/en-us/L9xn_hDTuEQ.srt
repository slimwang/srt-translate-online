1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,160
It's always intimidating [LAUGH]
when you start with a blank sheet.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,770
I can't tell you how many times I've
gone to start writing some article and

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,790
I'm just looking at the blank page and
I'm thinking, where do I start?

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,681
Do you get that feeling sometimes,
Duran,

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,222
when you start with something new?

6
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:17,720
>> Yeah, it's hard.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,650
You have to kind of psych yourself up.

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,830
Everyone has their own techniques for
just getting moving on a project.

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,870
Often you can just start with the things
you know, like you're going to use

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:35,020
a model view, some kind of controller
thing, so what can you start adding?

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,040
If it's a map,
maybe you're talking about places,

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,740
just finding some place you can start
and just start adding things and

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,410
then eventually the questions
will maybe just come.

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,296
But yeah, staring at that blank
sheet of paper, as you say,

15
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,010
is definitely difficult.

16
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:48,820
>> Yeah.

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,280
I would say too, kind of just pick one
part of the project to figure out first.

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,330
Whether it's the list view, whether you
want to get the search box working,

19
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,370
whether you want to get
parts of the map working.

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,840
I would pick one thing,
kind of figure out bits and

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,710
pieces of it,
kind of put that part together.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,190
And also, don't hesitate to kind of
step away from the big project and

23
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,750
maybe start just a little sample
project where you're like,

24
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:23,690
I'm really having a hard time figuring
out how to sort stuff in my list or

25
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,320
how to get all my markers to
have unique info windows.

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,940
It's good practice to maybe just say,
okay,

27
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,740
I think I've done a lot on my project,
I don't want to break what I have,

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,330
let me kind of write something up here
and just sort of a little side project.

29
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,230
And see if I can get this
functionality working and

30
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:46,950
then figure out how to apply it back to
my architecture that I've designed here.

31
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,480
I do that a lot myself.

32
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,128
There's a lot of times where
I'm working on a project and

33
00:01:53,128 --> 00:01:57,918
I'm like, I can't figure out how to
get this navigation to pop out right.

34
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,459
So I kind of make a little dummy site.

35
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:02,290
I kind of play around with things.

36
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,330
It's easy for me to do it that way
because it's on a much smaller scale,

37
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,783
and I'm less worried about breaking
a ton of [LAUGH] stuff in the process or

38
00:02:12,783 --> 00:02:15,930
having to do like 100 git commits or
something.

39
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,260
It's definitely useful
to take a step back,

40
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,260
look at sort of the smaller problems and
knock out some smaller things first.

41
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,735
>> This is the first project where
student's aren't really given anything.

42
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:35,300
[INAUDIBLE] but they don't really
any code to begin with, so

43
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,869
all the projects before this they were
given some sort of template code or

44
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,908
something to work off of.

45
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:47,510
And I think just opening up your text
editor to just a blank page could be

46
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:52,470
a little daunting at first, especially
for someone who's really new at this.

47
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,146
What kind of advice would you
give to somebody who's kind of

48
00:02:56,146 --> 00:02:57,919
faced with this blank page?

49
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:03,986
>> Well, first I'll tell you that
as someone who's been coding for

50
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:10,071
a long time, I still get writers
block from a blank page, right.

51
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:10,953
>> I do too.

52
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:11,848
>> Yeah.
>> I do too.

53
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:15,630
>> It's not something that
entirely goes away, but

54
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,793
it is something we get better at, right?

55
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:23,881
If you open up your text editor and
there's nothing there,

56
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:27,557
right, so
what do we know should be there?

57
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:29,720
Well, we definitely need an HTML file.

58
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,525
Without an HTML file,
you got nothing, right?

59
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:34,370
>> [LAUGH]
>> So you need an HTML file.

60
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,690
You need all of the basic
HTML [INAUDIBLE], right?

61
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,760
Depending on your tools,

62
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,220
you can actually install plug-ins
instead of just put all of the doc

63
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,590
type HTML, HTML head, body,
all that stuff in there for you.

64
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,943
So that unblankifies the page
a little bit, right?

65
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:57,532
But still, effectively,
you don't have any content,

66
00:03:57,532 --> 00:04:00,615
any stuff that you've put on your page,
right?

67
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,440
You also need to link up
your CSS file probably.

68
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,333
Unless you're making something that's
just, I don't know, a proof of concept,

69
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,070
a CSS stylus.

70
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,190
You also need a JavaScript file,
at least one.

71
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,615
You also have multiple [INAUDIBLE].

72
00:04:13,615 --> 00:04:19,129
It depends on how you want
to organize your code,

73
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:23,439
but then, where do you go from there?

74
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,343
And I'd suppose if,
I can tell you I would do.

75
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:30,343
I can't really tell,
I can't speak for everyone, but

76
00:04:30,343 --> 00:04:35,549
what I would do is I would start by,
I wouldn't worry about the styling.

77
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:38,830
I wouldn't worry about CSS or
any of that stuff.

78
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,156
I would just put some divs on
the page that represent the different

79
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:44,750
areas, right.

80
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,060
We know we need a map.

81
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,040
So I don't look at the Google Maps.

82
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,671
But actually even before you that,

83
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:58,340
I would try to get an idea of how
generally to get started with Knockout.

84
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,890
Well, I might even go to
the Knockout homepage and

85
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,190
look at the very basic examples and just
get their examples of writing, right?

86
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,920
Even though I don't necessarily need
a text box that says hello or a but

87
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,810
box says the same thing.

88
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,716
I may not need that, but
it gets something on the screen.

89
00:05:18,716 --> 00:05:21,189
And once you have
something on the screen,

90
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:25,102
you can be like, that's right okay,
I've got observables,

91
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:28,484
I've got data binding,
a data bind to connect things up.

92
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:33,009
All right, now my memory is jogged,
I'm ready to move forward so

93
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:34,460
I want to put a list.

94
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,694
All right, so what could I use?

95
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:39,570
An observable, an observable array.

96
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,270
How do I connect that up, all right,
let's look at that example, right,

97
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,350
that's how that works.

98
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,360
So it's not so

99
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,509
much about necessarily going in
the right direction right at the start.

100
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:56,274
It's about getting your bearings and-
>> Maybe it's kind of

101
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:57,830
picking something to begin.

102
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,480
>> Picking something,
just go in some direction, right?

103
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:00,980
>> Yeah.

104
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,651
>> Don't go off the deep end.

105
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:08,012
Don't start coding in a different
framework than you append to,

106
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:10,799
obviously, but this builds something.

107
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:15,551
Once you've built something, it'll be so
much easier to course correct,

108
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:19,130
change your course towards
where you ultimately end up.

109
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,180
So that's a little bit about how I work.

110
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,360
I don't know, it may not be for
everybody but that's been useful for me.
