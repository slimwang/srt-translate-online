1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,880
As it turns out, the internets design

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,020
is actually fundamentally insecure. Many explicit design choices

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,310
have caused the internet to be vulnerable

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,870
to different types of attacks. The internet was

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,770
designed for simplicity, and as a result

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,020
security was not a primary consideration when the

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,380
internet was originally designed. Another aspect of the

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,340
internet's design is that it's on by default.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,170
In other words, when a host is connected

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,460
to the internet, it is by default reachable by

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,570
any other host that has a public IP address.

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,600
This means that if one has an insecure host,

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,800
that host is effectively wide open to attack by

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,380
other hosts on the internet. Now, this wasn't a

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,470
primary design consideration when the internet consisted of a

16
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,540
small number of trusted networks, but as the internet

17
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,950
has continued to grow, this on by default design,

18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,940
or the notion that any host should always be

19
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,460
reachable by any other host has come under fire.

20
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,160
Part of the reason that their on by default model

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,070
does not work that well is that hosts are

22
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,990
insecure. This makes it possible for a remote attacker to

23
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,400
compromise a machine that's connected to the internet. And

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,850
commandeer it for the purposes of attack. In many cases,

25
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,100
an attack might actually just look like normal

26
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,720
traffic. For example, in the case of an attack

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,600
on a victim web server, every individual request

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,300
to that web server might look normal, but the

29
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,660
collection of requests together, mounted as part of

30
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,260
a, distributed denial of service attack. Might add up

31
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,790
to a volume of traffic that the server

32
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,600
is unable to handle. Finally, the internet's federated design,

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,270
obstructs cooperation for diagnosis or mitigation. In other words because the

34
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:52,190
internet is run by tens of thousands of independently run networks, it can be

35
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,600
very difficult to coordinate a defense against an attack because each of

36
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,470
these networks is run by different

37
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,310
network operators, sometimes in completely different countries
