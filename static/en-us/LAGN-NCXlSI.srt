1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,744
To get x by itself, we need to subtract b over 2a from both sides. Then, both of

2
00:00:05,744 --> 00:00:11,248
our fractions on the right-hand side have a denominator of 2a, so it's really

3
00:00:11,248 --> 00:00:16,709
easy to combine them. This gives us, finally, a final answer of x equals

4
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:22,810
negative b, plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a.

5
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,737
You can heave a giant sigh of relief now, that was a lot of work and it involved

6
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:32,589
some complicated Algebra. I think that in doing this, you had to use almost all

7
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:36,730
of the skills you've learned in this course so far. So, this is super

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,454
impressive, I am so proud of you. So, what does this mean again? Remember, we

9
00:00:41,454 --> 00:00:46,948
started out with an equation in this form, a quadratic equation, ax squared plus

10
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:51,871
bx plus c equals 0. Working from that, we've solved for x which means that now,

11
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:56,459
we have a formula where if we know the coefficients of a quadratic equation

12
00:00:56,459 --> 00:01:01,069
written in this form, we can find the values of x that satisfy it. In other

13
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:06,724
words, for any parabola we have, if we can write its equation in standard form,

14
00:01:06,724 --> 00:01:11,857
ax squared plus bx plus c equals y, then we can set y equal to 0 and find the

15
00:01:11,857 --> 00:01:17,487
x-intercepts. This is huge, this is incredibly powerful. And we did all of these

16
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:22,520
by just completing the square. And, of course, doing some other algebraic

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,651
manipulations.
