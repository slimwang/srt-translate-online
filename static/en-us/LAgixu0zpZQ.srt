1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,228
So we know that grant started off with a
certain amount of money from the venture

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,705
capital funders. But then he doesn't just
keep it, he starts to spend it. This means

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:12,958
that the right choice must take both of
these into account, the money that he was

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,128
given initially and the money that he
spent so far. The second and last choices

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,348
only have one of these two things each, so
that means that neither of them can be

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,508
right. So I'm going to cross them both
out. So that just leaves us with these

7
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:29,623
two. Money from funders plus money spent,
or money from funders minus money spent.

8
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:34,013
Spending money, actually takes away from
the amount of money that we have. It

9
00:00:34,025 --> 00:00:38,367
doesn't add to it. So that means that the
third choice, right here, money from

10
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:42,438
funders minus money spent must be the
right answer. Now without even trying

11
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,807
we've actually just done some math. I know
that there aren't any numbers here, but

12
00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:50,836
what we've created is called an equation.
It's called that because of this equal

13
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:55,495
sign right here in the middle. Over doing
with this equation is showing that these

14
00:00:55,507 --> 00:00:59,566
two quantities, the one on the left side
of the equal sign and the one on the right

15
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:03,642
side. Are equal to each other, or have the
same numerical value. This is the first of

16
00:01:03,654 --> 00:01:07,306
many, many equations that we're going to
look at throughout this course. And over

17
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:09,910
time you'll learn to do a ton of different
things with them.
