1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,370
Actually, if you read the policy, and

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,105
we said the policy sort of describes the
dos and don'ts and where they come from,

3
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:10,250
[ersonal use is allowed to some degree.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,320
They say it's incidental
personal use is okay.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,850
So it's all right if you send a message
to your friend or you family member.

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,220
Again, sort of need to
use your judgement when

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,710
incidental personal use ends and

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,180
personal use that is inconsistent
with this part of the policy starts.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:33,080
So, yet, it's not blanket prohibition,
but of course, I can't be

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,510
using Georgia Tech computers to support
a business that I haven't assigned.
