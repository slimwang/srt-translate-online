1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,977
For the second one, you need to type in the nthroot and a space. This will

2
00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:07,636
create this radical symbol. Your cursor bar will appear here, and you'll need

3
00:00:07,636 --> 00:00:10,350
to hit the Right Arrow key and then type in 5 to get what's underneath the

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:16,129
radical. These would be the keystrokes for our third expression. Notice that

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,106
after we type in the square root symbol, we don't need to hit the Right Arrow

6
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:23,178
key. That's because the index for this root is assumed to be a 2, It's rare

7
00:00:23,178 --> 00:00:28,320
that you'll ever see it, but we know it's a square root. That's why it's a 2.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,103
Math Quill knows it's 2, and so you're just placed back inside the radical. And

9
00:00:32,103 --> 00:00:36,166
then you can type in 21. Now for this last expression, you might not have any

10
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:40,600
idea what i is. That's okay. We're going to cover this later. To start this

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,240
expression, I would type in a forward slash. This would create an entire

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,199
fraction with a spot for a numerator and the denominator. We type in these

13
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:53,545
keystrokes in order to get our entire numerator. And notice that our cursor bar

14
00:00:53,545 --> 00:00:56,747
is here. Once we type in the 6, our cursor bar will appear here, and then we

15
00:00:56,747 --> 00:01:01,840
hit the Right Arrow key twice in order to move it down to the denominator.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,308
Then, we just type a 4 to wrap up our expression. Now, there are other ways

17
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:08,634
that you can have done this to recreate the fraction bar. You could've created

18
00:01:08,634 --> 00:01:13,080
the fraction bar after the 6. But that means, this forward slash would go in

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,600
between these 2 errors. After you type the 6, you're still inside the radical.

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,390
So, if you type the forward slash here, you'll create a fraction within the

21
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,010
radical. You don't want that to happen, so you hit the Right Arrow key once.

22
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,890
Which moves the cursor bar outside of the radical, and then you can type a

23
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,010
forward slash to create your fraction, hit the Right Arrow key again to move to

24
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:36,095
the denominator and then enter 4 to finish up. Either way you do this last one

25
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:39,939
is correct, I just want you to get comfortable using math quill.
