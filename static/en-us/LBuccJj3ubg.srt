00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:03,263
Welcome to our last Office Hours.

2
00:00:03,263 --> 00:00:07,379
This is basically just kind of a wrap up and any last questions that we saw

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,419
that we felt needed to be answered before we ended the course. Right? >>Yep, yep.

4
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,003
Okay. Let's just jump right in.

5
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:19,154
First question was if you were building
Reddit or Hipmunk today,

6
00:00:19,154 --> 00:00:26,233
would you build it on Google App Engine or
would you go ahead and--

7
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:32,020
That's a really good question, and
the short answer is: I'm not sure.

8
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,608
I think we could build Reddit or Hipmunk on
Google App Engine.

9
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:42,697
Probably definitely Hipmunk, a site that I know is--because it's a travel site--

10
00:00:42,706 --> 00:00:45,755
it's never going to be at the scale that Reddit is,

11
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:49,027
because even the biggest travel sites aren't anywhere near the scale that Reddit is.

12
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:51,787
Yeah, so I would have no problem doing that.

13
00:00:51,787 --> 00:00:55,959
Now, Reddit--it's funny, because when I started Reddit we didn't expect it to be a big site.

14
00:00:55,959 --> 00:01:01,027
I was actually--my level of knowledge was less than where yours is now.

15
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:04,241
App Engine would have saved us a lot of heartache.

16
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:10,001
Now, for the scale that Reddit is now, I don't know if App Engine would work.

17
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:15,141
Because it's at such a large scale we need to have control over a lot of little pieces,

18
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:19,321
but I think for the first couple of years of Reddit's life absolutely it would've worked just fine.

19
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:23,631
Over Reddit's existence, we've rewritten it
probably 5 or 6 times

20
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:28,469
and moved a couple data centers and we moved from our own machines

21
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:31,532
to our first data center to now we're on
Amazon Web Services.

22
00:01:31,532 --> 00:01:34,228
Each of those was a pretty major
architecture change.

23
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,903
I imagine we'd consider starting the App Engine

24
00:01:36,903 --> 00:01:40,829
and then probably migrate to our own more custom setup down the road.
