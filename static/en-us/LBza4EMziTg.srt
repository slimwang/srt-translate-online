1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,086
Since we don't have any robotic dolphins
that we could be doing testing and

2
00:00:05,086 --> 00:00:09,850
training on, let's think through
an example of doing reinforcement

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,068
learning to try to teach a robot
soccer player to score a goal.

4
00:00:14,068 --> 00:00:17,226
So, this is supposed to be
kind of a robot soccer pitch.

5
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:18,364
This is the goal in blue.

6
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:19,629
This is the ball in yellow.

7
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:21,522
And this is the robot in black.

8
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,806
And what we really want it
to do is score in the goal.

9
00:00:25,806 --> 00:00:26,560
And that's worth a hundred.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,574
Again, just like in the dolphin case,

11
00:00:28,574 --> 00:00:32,479
it's very unlikely that the robot is
going to spontaneously drive around,

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,568
drive around, hit the ball into the
goal, experience the 100 and then say,

13
00:00:36,568 --> 00:00:39,400
okay, cool,
that's what I'm supposed to be doing.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,001
So, what are some things
we can do shaping-wise?

15
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,645
How can we modify this
reward function so

16
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:49,407
that it might encourage something in
the direction of scoring the goal?

17
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:51,427
>> I think, there are a couple
of things one might do.

18
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:53,506
I'll try not to over-think this.

19
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:58,106
Well, in order to kick the ball,
the circle with its circle feet,

20
00:00:58,106 --> 00:01:02,869
it has to get near the ball, so
I could imagine putting some reward for

21
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:05,927
being near the ball,
wherever the ball is.

22
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:06,740
>> Cool.

23
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,086
So, you think like plus one
is enough for that or maybe?

24
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:10,548
>> I don't know, but
let's start with plus one.

25
00:01:10,548 --> 00:01:11,128
>> All right.

26
00:01:11,128 --> 00:01:12,905
How do we define near the ball?

27
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:15,744
There's going to be some kind
of epsilon ball around the ball?

28
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:17,962
>> [LAUGH] Yeah, that makes sense.

29
00:01:17,962 --> 00:01:22,666
Or, you could go all the way around and
think about the distance you

30
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:27,539
are to the ball is inversely
proportional to the reward that you get.

31
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,966
>> Good point.

32
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:31,521
All right, let's look at your
way of thinking about it first.

33
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:34,293
So, if we're getting a reward,

34
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:39,741
the agent is getting a reward by
virtue of being close to the ball.

35
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:42,446
What's a good policy?

36
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:44,986
A good policy might be
to just sit in place or

37
00:01:44,986 --> 00:01:48,668
sit a little bit closer to the ball and
just rack up the points.

38
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:50,502
>> Sure, so
then you'd need something else,

39
00:01:50,502 --> 00:01:52,348
like hitting the ball
is worth some points.

40
00:01:52,348 --> 00:01:56,366
>> Aha, okay,
that seems plausible, right.

41
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,879
So, if the robot is getting additional
points, additional pleasure for

42
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,280
getting closer to the ball, and
then actually hitting the ball, yay,

43
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,539
that was really awesome.

44
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:08,256
But, of course, by hitting the ball
it pushes the ball away which

45
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,306
is going to cause the near to
the ball score to go down.

46
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:14,383
So, it's going actually kind
of be sad that it did that.

47
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:14,987
>> Sure.

48
00:02:14,987 --> 00:02:17,629
But then,
you would want to give it something for

49
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:19,503
getting the ball near to the goal.

50
00:02:19,503 --> 00:02:23,044
So, just like being near to the ball
is worth something proportional,

51
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:26,585
inversely proportional distance,
you want the distance of the ball to

52
00:02:26,585 --> 00:02:29,963
the goal to also be inversely
proportionally related to distance.

53
00:02:29,963 --> 00:02:30,845
>> Yeah, that makes some sense!

54
00:02:30,845 --> 00:02:36,326
So, now, we want to be careful that the
amount of bonus that the robot gets for

55
00:02:36,326 --> 00:02:40,867
pushing the ball toward the goal
is going to be an improvement over

56
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:44,823
the fact that it's now no
longer itself near the ball.

57
00:02:44,823 --> 00:02:46,100
>> Right, so I don't know.

58
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,099
Two times, or something.

59
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:47,725
I don't know.

60
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:49,596
I mean, I don't know exactly what
the right numbers are, but there you go,

61
00:02:49,596 --> 00:02:50,164
something like that.

62
00:02:50,164 --> 00:02:52,794
>> So, it seems like we could
play with these numbers for

63
00:02:52,794 --> 00:02:55,318
a long time trying to get
the behavior that we want.

64
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:58,615
And there are a couple of really
interesting failure modes.

65
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:03,255
So, for example, if we have hitting
the ball being defined as making

66
00:03:03,255 --> 00:03:06,057
contact between the player and the ball.

67
00:03:06,057 --> 00:03:08,176
And you get, let's say +10 for
that each time,

68
00:03:08,176 --> 00:03:10,016
ignoring these other factors for
a moment.

69
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:13,939
Then, once thing [LAUGH] that you often
see when you ask reinforcement learners

70
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:16,436
to learn in that kind of setting,
as you'll see,

71
00:03:16,436 --> 00:03:19,837
robot walks over to the ball,
touches the ball, gets its plus ten.

72
00:03:19,837 --> 00:03:22,516
And it turns out,
if you want to get that plus ten again,

73
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:25,537
the best thing to do is just back
off from the ball a little bit and

74
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:27,190
then make contact with it again and

75
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,576
in fact really what you want to do is
go up to the ball, and just shiver.

76
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:33,009
Right, just like vibrate back and
forth, [SOUND] so

77
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:36,137
that you just keep getting plus
tens over and over and over again.

78
00:03:36,137 --> 00:03:38,180
You can make a lot of money that way.

79
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,514
A lot more than you can
make by scoring the goal.

80
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:45,356
Because you can do this, you know 30 or
40 times a second if you're

81
00:03:45,356 --> 00:03:50,363
a good wiggler, and so this ends up
actually even though this additional

82
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:54,880
shaping information that we're
defining is giving good hints,

83
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,357
it's also creating
spurious optimal policies.

84
00:03:58,357 --> 00:03:58,996
>> Right.

85
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:00,261
Well, it makes sense, right.

86
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:04,481
People have been making money for
thousands of years by wiggling.

87
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:08,081
>> [LAUGH] I guess that's sort of true.

88
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:12,124
But in this particular case,
what we have to do is somehow make it so

89
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:14,234
that you can't have a money pump.

90
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:15,418
You can't do arbitrage.

91
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:19,946
You can't, by doing the good thing,
undoing it and then doing it again,

92
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:21,199
get double credit.

93
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,012
>> I see.

94
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,089
>> So, a natural idea is
to actually say, all right,

95
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:27,022
if you're going to get plus ten for

96
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:31,114
hitting the ball, then letting go
of the ball should be a minus ten.

97
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:34,221
Right?
You should not be able to make a profit

98
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:36,977
by repeatedly bumping into the ball.

99
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,080
Does that make some sense?

100
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,049
>> It does.
My favorite part about that is how

101
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:42,371
you called it an actual idea which,
as opposed,

102
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:44,139
makes what I said not an actual idea.

103
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:45,498
But yeah, okay.

104
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:49,178
>> Oh,
I did not mean to imply that or even-

105
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:49,712
>> That's fine.

106
00:04:49,712 --> 00:04:50,374
>> Say it.

107
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,396
>> It's fine.

108
00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:51,953
It's fine.

109
00:04:51,953 --> 00:04:53,260
It's fine.
I see what kind of rewards

110
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,054
shaping your doing.

111
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:56,621
It's okay.
[LAUGH] In any case what I guess is

112
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:58,941
happening, so that makes sense.

113
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:01,906
So, you don't want to get into a place
where you can get into a suboptimal

114
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:02,610
positive loop.

115
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,419
So, you're going to say,
getting to the ball is good.

116
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:08,577
Getting away from the ball is not good.

117
00:05:08,577 --> 00:05:11,640
>> So, you're going to learn to get to
the ball and have to do something else,

118
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,148
that will get you even more reward,

119
00:05:13,148 --> 00:05:15,172
make it worthwhile backing
away from the ball.

120
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:16,170
>> Right, good.

121
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:21,650
And I like the thing that you said about
not wanting to create a suboptimal loop.

122
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,635
>> A suboptimal positive loop.

123
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:28,218
>> [SOUND] Because a suboptimal
positive loop is actually going to

124
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:31,309
cause this spurious behavior to happen.

125
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:34,576
If there is a way that you can
do a sequence of actions and

126
00:05:34,576 --> 00:05:39,265
generate profit where there really
shouldn't have been in the environment,

127
00:05:39,265 --> 00:05:41,339
then it's distracting, right.

128
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:44,613
The agent is going to end up doing
things that you didn't wanted to do.

129
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:47,759
So, we have to avoid creating
these suboptimal positive loops.

130
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,950
And so a natural idea from,
I'm going to say physics.

131
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,523
And you can tell I'm
an expert in physics,

132
00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:59,253
because I understand Bellman's equation,
Einstein's Bellman equation.

133
00:05:59,253 --> 00:06:07,355
That is that the idea
of potential functions.

134
00:06:07,355 --> 00:06:11,476
What I am going to do is define
potential functions and then show how we

135
00:06:11,476 --> 00:06:15,970
can use them to do shaping without
actually messing up the optimal policy.

136
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,000
>> I look forward to it.
