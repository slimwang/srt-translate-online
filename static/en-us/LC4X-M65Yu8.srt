00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,020
Why did you choose iOS development,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:06,080
what do you find interesting or
fascinating about iOS?

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,570
So what brings you to
iOS develop instead of,

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,690
maybe, backend develop or anything else?

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,068
>> When I started writing
code it was with C and C++.

6
00:00:17,068 --> 00:00:19,992
And I was writing small apps that
would run from the command line, but

7
00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:23,171
I never really got the opportunity to
write something that could quickly go

8
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:24,940
into somebody's hands.

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,480
So when I wrote my first app,
the thing I was hoping for

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,030
by writing apps was being able to
build something that I could give to

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,020
my brother or my friends and
see what their reactions were, and

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,610
build apps that were more tailored for
users as opposed to other developers.

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,570
>> And do you have a GitHub profile?

14
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,750
Do you have any side project
that you work on on your own?

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,956
>> Yeah, I have a GitHub link,
I can share that with you later.

16
00:00:52,956 --> 00:00:56,861
But right now one thing that I'm
working on, I'm a big gamer and

17
00:00:56,861 --> 00:01:01,170
I grew up playing the Nintendo and
the Gameboy, and things like that.

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,110
I was a big fan of Pokemon, which is
a little top down adventure game,

19
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:10,150
and I'm trying to recreate that
using Strike-It, just for fun.

20
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,070
So, take a game with the mechanics that
I know, that I've played before and

21
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,380
then I can simulate
them on a Gameboy and

22
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,400
try to replicate those using iOS',
or Apple's frameworks.

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,052
>> Okay, and you're doing this
on your own, on your free time?

24
00:01:23,052 --> 00:01:26,900
>> Yeah, just on the weekends, or
sometimes during the week I'll plug

25
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,900
around with that and
other side projects.

26
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,680
>> Okay, thank you.
