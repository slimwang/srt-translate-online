1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,890
I'm here with Cameron Pittman, who's
a course developer here at Udacity.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,430
Thank you so much for
talking to me today.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,290
>> Yeah, happy to be here.

4
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,870
>> So Cameron's here to talk about
some use of games in education.

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,400
And so I know you did something really
cool back when you taught in high school

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,850
with games in your
high school classroom.

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,070
So can you tell us
a little bit about that?

8
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,350
>> Sure.
So I was teaching high school physics,

9
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,420
and I realized I wanted
a better lab simulator.

10
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,700
It's really hard to find
lab supplies sometimes and

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,290
it's sometimes a lot easier
to use something virtual.

12
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,220
So I decided to use a video game,
because they're easily accessible and

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,540
readily available.

14
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,980
And I wound up using the video
game Portal 2 to teach physics.

15
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,790
Portal Two has a puzzle maker in it.

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,320
And this puzzle maker makes it really,

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,720
really easy to make a level
in about five minutes.

18
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,020
It really is so simple that even
somebody who has never even really used

19
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,360
a computer before can figure it out.

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,710
All you need to use is click and
drag and maybe one or two clicks, and

21
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,700
you actually have a full-blown level.

22
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,240
And because the game is
essentially a physics puzzle game,

23
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,330
the game itself follows
the laws of physics.

24
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,930
So what I had my students doing
is building levels in the game

25
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,250
that were essentially experiments.

26
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,990
And then I had them running experiments,
collecting data, and

27
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,640
then comparing the data they were
collecting to what they would expect to

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,790
see in the real world.

29
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,140
Which was pretty cool.

30
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,370
It was pretty wild.

31
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,220
We wound up doing about
ten labs in the class.

32
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,590
We did everything from
simple momentum and

33
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,610
motion to kinetic energy,
potential energy.

34
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,000
We even did some thermodynamics in
the game, which is pretty wild.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,910
Because the laws of physics hold up
that well, that essentially we could

36
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,760
throw a bunch of objects bouncing off of
each other into a level, and it kind of,

37
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,860
sort of followed the laws of
thermodynamics, which is amazing.

38
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,990
We had some other cool ones
with terminal velocity.

39
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,140
And, yeah, I just had my
students comparing what they saw

40
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,860
to what they would see
in the real world.

41
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,000
And it wound up being a really,
really fun semester.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,630
>> Yeah, I bet.

43
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,620
I bet they really got
a kick out of that.

44
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,600
So for any of our students who
might develop games to be used

45
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,770
in the classroom.

46
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,860
What do you need to think
about when you're developing

47
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,550
games to the classroom?

48
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,840
Make sure they're really a learning
experience and not a distraction for

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,090
the students, or just something they
kind of have fun playing around with,

50
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,410
and don't learn anything from?

51
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,620
>> Sure well it's important to remember
that games are a means to an end and

52
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,699
just one tool amongst many that
teachers have at their disposal.

53
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:14,400
So I think the idea here is just simply
make sure that the game, like the fun

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,630
mechanics of the game, are teaching
what you want students to learn.

55
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,840
So I kind of saw using Portal
as a way to engage students.

56
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,430
Because immediately you're using
a video game which is new and

57
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,720
different that students aren't familiar
with, normally in a classroom.

58
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,470
But they love outside of the classroom,
so I had their attention and

59
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,100
that's half the battle
in a physics class.

60
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,880
I was really happy about that.

61
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,420
And then the other thing that I
was really happy about is that

62
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,390
the actual mechanics of the game,

63
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,130
reflected exactly what I wanted
students to be learning at that time.

64
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,750
So there are a number of ways that you
can make an educational game just awful.

65
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,660
For instance, you could create let's say
a fighting game, a beat them up game.

66
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,820
But instead of getting a new life at the
end of the level you have to solve some

67
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,480
math problems and
then you get a new life.

68
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,100
That's silly.

69
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,030
That's dumb.
That's just a big distraction.

70
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,090
What you would want to do instead is
create a game maybe like Dragonbox.

71
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,410
Have you ever heard of that one?

72
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,320
>> I have not, no.

73
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,250
>> Oh it's awesome,
it's an algebra game.

74
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,910
And it's essentially,
it looks like a card game, but

75
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,200
it follows the laws of algebra.

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,040
You have to put cards in certain places,
and

77
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,610
what you're really doing there
is having fun with fractions,

78
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,400
and cross multiplying, and
it's actually a ton of fun.

79
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,960
And it's not a distraction, whatsoever.

80
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,470
Because the actual fun game
mechanic is teaching algebra.

81
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,630
>> Huh.
Very interesting.

82
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,550
Now the one thing that I feel it's
worth noting though, is that there

83
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,840
are those in the education community
which, and just for full disclosure,

84
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,270
I am one of them, that are often dubious
about the usage of games in education.

85
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,850
Mostly because many of us think

86
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,620
that it's really important to make
the material appealing in-and-of itself.

87
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,680
That if we have to put a game on it,

88
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,370
we've kind of already
fought a losing battle.

89
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,610
And now, when they move on to a class
that doesn't use games, they're just

90
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,590
going to tune out, because I'm used
to learning being very engaging and

91
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,940
fun because there was
a game attached to it.

92
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,620
And now I don't learn in the real world.

93
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,560
What would you say to people like me
who have that criticism about this?

94
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,530
That doesn't sound like that applies to
the Portal 2 thing but for other games,

95
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,250
what would you say to that?

96
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,290
>> I understand that concern.

97
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,150
I love physics and

98
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,700
I think physics in and
of itself should be super interesting.

99
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,190
Same thing with basically all science or
engineering in tech.

100
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,280
But for instance if I were
learning lets say I don't know,

101
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,670
what didn't I like in school?

102
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,792
I liked all my classes.

103
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:15,723
>> [LAUGH] You're not
the target audience for this.

104
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:18,880
>> [LAUGH] But
I think it's just one tool of many.

105
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,440
If it's a distraction, and
if it takes away from the fun or

106
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,150
the essence, of the material itself.

107
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,190
You're probably just
using the game wrong.

108
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,220
It's a tool like anything else.

109
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,980
It's just another media form.

110
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:34,000
You have videos, you have books you
have audio, these are all very valid and

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,460
relevant media sources to learn
anything and now you have games.

112
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,940
Games are just another way
to interact with material.

113
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,830
So despite the fact that normally
they are associated with fun and

114
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,160
they could potentially be distracting.

115
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,780
If used in the right way I think
there's really nothing to fear there.

116
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,680
>> I think you're getting at
a really important distinction,

117
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,650
which is between using games for
education and game-ifying education,

118
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,340
which are two very different things.

119
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,720
When we attach these badges and

120
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,840
things like that to education
it can apply some motivators.

121
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,170
But they're really extrinsic motivators,

122
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,360
which might not get to the heart of
what we really want to do in education.

123
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,400
Do you have any final thoughts for our
students who might be looking at doing

124
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,010
a game for their class project here?

125
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,370
>> You should go for it.

126
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,080
It's fun.
It's so much fun, and when you see kids'

127
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,730
eyes light up, when you see them get
really excited about playing a game, and

128
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,730
feel motivated to solve the kind of
problems that you want them to solve.

129
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,810
That's awesome, it's great.

130
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,260
It's a fantastic feeling, but at the end
of the day, it's just a lot of fun.

131
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,890
I mean,
you're adding fun to the classroom.

132
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,330
And there's really no reason that
learning can't be super enjoyable for

133
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,030
everybody involved.

134
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,690
So I say go for it.

135
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,820
Have a good time.

136
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,320
>> Cool.

137
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,540
Well thank you so
much for talking to us.

138
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,860
>> Yeah.
>> And have a great rest of your day.

139
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,440
>> Happy to be here.

140
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:37,940
Thanks.
