00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,514
Remember that the bin size is the interval in which you're counting the

2
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:09,458
frequency. So, in this histogram, the interval is 10, and in this histogram the

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,617
interval is 20. Therefore, this histogram has a smaller bin size.
