1
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,680
>> Sure. We could do this intuitively or

2
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,140
we could be a little bit more, systematic about it.

3
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,960
And one way of getting a hint on things is to actually look at the constraints.

4
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,665
And you'll notice that for the constraints that we had the answers that

5
00:00:47,665 --> 00:00:52,810
Jerrod gave were also already on the left hand side of the equations. In fact,

6
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:58,230
they were the in the context part of the constraint, they were the class that

7
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:05,980
that came first. So that's a hit you can use to try to

8
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:11,540
decide who's responsible for maintaining them. Now, in actual practice,

9
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,775
any component could be responsible, okay? Or we could introduce a new

10
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:20,809
component to be responsible. In fact that's what were going with this

11
00:01:20,809 --> 00:01:26,070
how do we manage the indirect constraints that are more than one class?

12
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,190
Will that means some kind of interaction among the classes or components, and

13
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,640
who's responsible for managing that. That turns out to be a tricky part of this.

14
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,970
And we want to handle that in a systematic way as well.
