00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,010
Now let's do an exercise together. So consider the sentence, Bill shot Bob.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,390
Once again, shot is a verb here, that does not quite map internal [UNKNOWN]

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,920
primitive actions clearly, cleanly. So perhaps there is an implied action here.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,020
So first write down the sentence in terms of a primitive action,

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,020
then write down the frame from this primitive action so fill the slots.
