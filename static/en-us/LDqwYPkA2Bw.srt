00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,152
I think it's time that we introduce a pretty important word, the root of a

2
00:00:04,152 --> 00:00:08,316
polynomial. This is a word we're going to hear more and more in the coming

3
00:00:08,316 --> 00:00:12,834
lessons. So I think we should get used to it now. So if the root of a polynomial

4
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:16,684
is a number n, such that when you substitute n in the spot of x in that

5
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:21,276
polynomial, it makes the polynomial equal to 0. Then what do you think the root

6
00:00:21,276 --> 00:00:26,000
is? Where do we get that number that is the root from? Is the root just 0? Is it

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,529
the x coordinate of the vertex of the parabola? Is it the y coordinate of the

8
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:34,989
vertex? Is it the x coordinate of the y intercept? The y coordinate of the y

9
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:39,493
intercept? The x coordinate of the x intercept? Or the y coordinate of the x

10
00:00:39,493 --> 00:00:40,234
intercept?
