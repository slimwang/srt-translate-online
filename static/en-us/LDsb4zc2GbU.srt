1
00:00:00,106 --> 00:00:01,014
To sum this exercise.

2
00:00:01,014 --> 00:00:04,542
First, I'll want to check out the most recent commit again using the commit ID

3
00:00:04,542 --> 00:00:05,910
that I noted down.

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,610
This is in the instructor's notes in case you forgot it.

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,160
Then I'll do a git log.

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,360
And I want to check out each of these commits one at a time until I

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,130
find the one with the bug.

8
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:15,830
If I do that,

9
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,920
I'll find that this commit has the bug and the previous commit does not.

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,870
That means that the commit starting with 25ed is the one that

11
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,640
introduced the bug and this commit ID is the answer to the quiz.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,936
If we want to know exactly how the bug got introduced,

13
00:00:30,936 --> 00:00:33,530
we can use git diff to compare the commits.

14
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,880
I'll do that now so git diff.

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,910
Then the first commit ID.

16
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,340
Then the second.

17
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,748
As you can see in addition to some other changes, this commit removed the line,

18
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:46,280
delayBeforeBullet equals 10.

19
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,830
It's not surprising that this removal would cause the problem we saw.

20
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,160
My guess is that the line was removed accidentally,

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,700
while making these other changes
