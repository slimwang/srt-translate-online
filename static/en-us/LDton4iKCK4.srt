1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:06,540
The example here says we have a sort
of system that has three users.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,520
The users are A, B, C,
because rows correspond to users.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,430
And we have three resources as well,
we calling them X, Y and Z.

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,000
These are three objects
of the resources we have.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,360
And if we look at the matrix says
well A can read write execute.

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,700
Object X can only read object Y and
has no access to object Z.

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:33,000
B can read write Y and
can read execute Z and things like that.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,430
So this matrix actually tells you who
can do what given the three users and

9
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,940
the three sources we have.

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,900
So if you want to implement
the information that's in this access

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,010
control matrix.

12
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,920
Well using ACLs then we look
at what's at the top here.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,780
So what would ACLs or
ACLs correspond to object.

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,020
So the first object is X,

15
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,960
first go on you find user A who
has read write execute permission.

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,870
So that's an entry in the list that
we're going to, actually in this case

17
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,819
the list is only going to have one
entry because B has no access, C has no

18
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,270
access, those are null entries that we
don't need to represent in this list.

19
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,550
So the ACL for X it's just going to
be this one entry which says,

20
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,570
user A can read, write,
and execute this object.

21
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,320
Still talking with ACLs, if you look
at Y, the second resource we have here.

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,480
Actually, here we're going to have three
entries in the ACL, one for each user.

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,285
A is going to be able to read it,
B can read, write it.

24
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:28,900
C can read write it, too.

25
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,100
Similarly for the last resource,
we're going to have two entries.

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,040
A has no access, but B and
C do, so we can read and

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,150
execute it and she can read and
execute it as well.

28
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,470
So this information that we have in the
access control matrix gets represented

29
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,090
with three access control lists.

30
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,580
One for each object.

31
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,610
This is for X, for Y, and for Z.

32
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,955
Now another way to represent this
very same information is to using

33
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:56,250
capability lists or C-lists.

34
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,050
So remember C-lists are for user.

35
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:04,460
So we have to have a C-list for user A,
one for user B, and one for user C.

36
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,639
If you look at A,
it has access to both X and Y.

37
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,030
So the C-list would have two entries.

38
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,770
If user A has access for resource X and

39
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,820
the access rights
are read write execute.

40
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,890
Similarly user A can read resource Y.

41
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,732
So this is the C-list of user A.

42
00:02:22,732 --> 00:02:24,440
Similarly C-list for

43
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,980
user B is going to be no access for
resource X, so nothing for X.

44
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,720
But for Y we're going to have read
write access and similarly for

45
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,210
Z we're going to have
read execute access.

46
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,498
So this C-list is going
to have two entries.

47
00:02:37,498 --> 00:02:40,760
And the C-list is going to look
the same for user C because B and

48
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,740
C have same kind of access.

49
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,350
The given set of resources
that we have here.

50
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,225
ACLs, you go vertical per resource.

51
00:02:48,225 --> 00:02:52,280
C-list, you go horizontal or
row-wise per user, so

52
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,560
we are talking about how you
implement an Access Control Matrix.

53
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,080
Well, one way is to define or
have this list that we have, and

54
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,390
we'll talk about where these lists get
stored or maintained, but the ACL or

55
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:11,489
ACM information gets captured
either in ACLs or in C-lists.
