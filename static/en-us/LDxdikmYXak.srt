00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
For this problem you're given six certificates.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The question is which ones would be useful to connect to udacity.com.

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Assume that we know ku,ca, the public key of the certificate authority,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and for notation H is a hash function and E is RSA encryption.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that are useful to establish a secure session.
