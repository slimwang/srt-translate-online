1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,240
And the answer is that Y1 should be and
Y2 should be 2.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,090
From the solution for

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,390
X, we can tell that the basis
is the first two columns here.

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,024
So we'll go ahead and call that B.

5
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:15,020
And we want to perform row
operations on this, so

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,530
that we hit this part of the objective
value, exactly, and achieve equality.

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,350
We'll call this portion of
the objective coefficients, CB.

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,810
Setting up the linear equations,

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,920
we have that Y transpose B
should be equal to CB transpose.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,380
And by simple back substitution,
we achieve the right answer.

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,310
We can check the answer by making
sure that it gives us the same

12
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,620
objective value.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,592
So substituting in here, we have 2
plus 4 times 2, which is equal to 10.

14
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:49,935
And for the dual,
our solution is 10 as well.

15
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:55,253
We have 1 times 6, which is 6 and
2 times 2, which is 4.

16
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:58,375
And adding them together,
we also get 10.

17
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:02,296
We should also check the feasibility
of our dual solution by checking that

18
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:05,459
the bound on the coefficients for
the objective function,

19
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,250
behave themselves for
these coefficients as well.

20
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,320
And indeed, they do.

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,640
We get 1 here, and -2 here,
for a total of -1,

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,272
which is indeed greater than negative 2.

23
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:21,910
And regarding X4, we have 1 times 2,

24
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:26,194
which is 1 minus 1,
times 2, so that's 0.

25
00:01:26,194 --> 00:01:29,820
And 0 is indeed greater
than the -1 here.

26
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,010
So our choice for Y,
was indeed feasible.
