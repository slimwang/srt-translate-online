1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,546
We want to take the square root of both sides of the equation. We want to make

2
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:07,175
sure that at least one of those sides has a plus or minus next to it. Since the

3
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:11,094
left side doesn't, the right side needs it. So that rules out all of our answers

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,757
that don't have plus or minus symbols in front of them. This first answer is

5
00:00:14,757 --> 00:00:18,837
definitely correct because it has a square root sign over the entire expression,

6
00:00:18,837 --> 00:00:22,869
those on the right hand side originally. However, when we have a square root

7
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:27,017
over a fraction. This is the same as taking the square root of the numerator

8
00:00:27,017 --> 00:00:31,395
over the square root of the denominator. So this choice is correct as well. If

9
00:00:31,395 --> 00:00:35,883
we simplify that denominator, square root of 4a squared, that just gives us 2a,

10
00:00:35,883 --> 00:00:40,187
so the last choice is also correct. There's so many different ways of writing

11
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:44,347
this, however I think that this last one is probably the most simple, since it

12
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:46,330
has the fewest radicals involved.
