1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
I Michael Charles how's it going it's

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,720
going quite well how's it going with you

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,740
good good good good so today I thought

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,849
we would talk a little bit about the

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:10,949
philosophy of machinery who hate

6
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:12,900
philosophy I don't like it much either

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,638
although I'm a Doctor of Philosophy oh

8
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:16,379
that's very impressive aren't you dr.

9
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,269
philosophy to have its kind of imprint

10
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:19,469
of his kind of impressive

11
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:21,000
so what we wanted to kind of get across

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,559
the day is a little bit about why we the

13
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,329
class structure the way it is what the

14
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:26,789
different parts are and maybe go a

15
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,859
little bit of back and forth about what

16
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:29,820
we think you should be getting out of

17
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,018
course it seemed reasonable

18
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:33,058
sure ok so first off by the way before

19
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:34,619
we get started I want to thank you for

20
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,270
coming down to atlanta and join me in

21
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,539
these beautiful studios but it's it's

22
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,649
very nice to be here thank you for

23
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:41,280
inviting me

24
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,320
no no thank you for coming Michael thank

25
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,820
you for asking me to do the course this

26
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,869
has been a lot of fun

27
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:47,369
oh the whole point was built of course

28
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:49,500
with you want we like each other and

29
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,579
that's one of the things that we want

30
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:51,988
you to get want to get across this class

31
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:53,698
because we like machine learning a lot

32
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:56,369
of stuff in common but i'm not sure we

33
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:59,280
completely agree on the most important

34
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,689
parts of machine learning and why we do

35
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:01,738
the things that we do

36
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:03,780
alright so i think people now sarwar

37
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,308
Michael would claim that you're more

38
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:08,010
theoretical than i am and carry in

39
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,840
theory and I'm more practical than you

40
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,890
are practically at least in practice and

41
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,599
hopefully some potential to come out in

42
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,188
the class but I think in order to see

43
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:19,200
why that tension works that way you have

44
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,519
to understand what machine learning is

45
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,430
so Michael right what's machine learning

46
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,009
it's about proving games

47
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,259
no I would not say it's about proving

48
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,269
there's although proving theorems is

49
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:32,670
often important machine i agree with

50
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,150
that

51
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,709
ok so we're on the same page we're

52
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:36,659
partially on the same page what is

53
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,759
machine 1 what is machine learning the

54
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,319
right definition so it is computational

55
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,188
statistics

56
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,019
how's that for definition that is a

57
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:47,938
definition it is wrong on so many levels

58
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:49,890
however a lot of people would agree with

59
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,180
that statement they would say that

60
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,920
machine learning is really just applied

61
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,810
statistics applied statistics

62
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,540
computational statistics computationally

63
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,359
about statistics i don't like that

64
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,688
definition i think that it's a bit too

65
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:05,159
narrow I think the machine learning

66
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,530
about this broader notion of building

67
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,868
artifacts computational artifacts

68
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:12,900
typically that learn over time based on

69
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,349
experience

70
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:15,180
and in particular it's not just the

71
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,740
active building these artifacts that

72
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,349
matter it's the math behind it it's the

73
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:21,030
science behind it it's engineering

74
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,919
behind it and it's the computing behind

75
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:25,229
it's everything that goes into building

76
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,509
intelligent artifacts that almost by

77
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:29,759
necessity have to learn over time by

78
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,449
that

79
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:33,000
yeah so you have data and you do an

80
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,199
ounce of the date and try to glean

81
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,930
things from the data and use various

82
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,469
kinds of computational structure to do

83
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:43,590
that so computational statistic

84
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,909
I don't think that's computational

85
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:50,359
system
