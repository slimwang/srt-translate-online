00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,400
Ajax stands for asynchronous JavaScript and

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,360
XML request, we can ignore the XML part of the acronym.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,010
For now, let's just think of it as an asynchronous JavaScript request.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,550
Ajax requests allow for content retrieval and

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,059
display without reloading the webpage.

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,950
Asynchronous in Ajax,

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,750
refers to the fact that the request doesn't block other events from happening.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,730
Instead, the page keeps on doing its thing,

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,680
and then only acts on the data when it gets returned by the server.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,390
AJAX requests occur in a number of different ways and

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,930
with varying levels of difficulty.

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,300
Some require an API key, others use O-off, and

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,980
some don't use any authentication at all.

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,540
And, the data returned by a different AJAX request differs too.

15
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:48,360
X in AJAX stands for XML which used to be the dominant hierarchical data format.

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,710
But today, JSON is much more popular,

17
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,930
in fact most AJAX requests nowadays are actually a JEDGE request standing for.

18
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,380
Asynchronous JavaScript and

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:02,660
Json request, but it doesn't sound as nice so we still just call them Ajax.

20
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,570
Embedded within Ajax responses, it's pretty common to see HTML,

21
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,210
which websites can use to fill in part part of page.

22
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,010
As part of the project for

23
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,170
this course, you'll have to try three different asynchronous request techniques.

24
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,040
You'll have to work with the Google Street View,

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,520
Wikipedia, and New York Times APIs, all three of which work very differently.
