00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,790
So in essence, this sort of technique,

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,330
sometimes referred to
computing shape from x.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,530
We looked at examples of using
perspective, shading, motion,

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,440
focus, occlusions and objects.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,830
There are still of course many other
methods that are possible to extract

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,640
shape or depth or range imaging
from sometimes single image or

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,590
seas of images.
