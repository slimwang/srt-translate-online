00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,020
Finally, I want you to consider, again,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,480
a toy shop where every worker
knows how to build any toy.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,680
And in this case,
we said that as the rates at which

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,960
toy orders start coming in increases,
the manager keeps scaling up,

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,490
keeps adding workers and
workbenches and parts, etc.

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,250
My question to you is,
until when does this work?

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,880
As a hint, think about whether
endless scaling is possible.
