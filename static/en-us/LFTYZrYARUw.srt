00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,710
A platform which terminates apps on its
own is a pretty radical departure for

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,029
anyone like me who cut their
teeth in desktop development.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,640
You start with the onCreate method,
where you build and wire up your UI.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,719
Once that's done,
your activity has been created.

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:16,460
It likely won't be a surprise to
you that there are also methods

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,570
when the activity becomes visible,
onStart, and another for

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,539
when it gains focus and becomes
the active foreground app, onResume.

8
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:26,309
That same sequence then
happens in reverse.

9
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:28,669
OnPause indicates
the activity has lost focus,

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,650
followed by onStop when
the app is no longer visible.

11
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:33,269
Finally, there's an onDestroy method,

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,859
indicating the end of
the app life cycle.

13
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:37,219
When your app is first launched,

14
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:39,509
it quickly moves through
these three states.

15
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:42,640
Create, start, and resume,
one after the other.

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,149
Within the full application lifetime,
from when onCreate is first called,

17
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:48,890
until the app is terminated,
it will move to through the active and

18
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,179
visible life cycles many times.

19
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:52,719
Let's look at those in
a little more detail.
