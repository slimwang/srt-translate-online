Hi Michael.
>> Hi Charles, How's it going?

2
00:00:01,596 --> 00:00:03,600
>> It's going quite well,
how's it going with you?

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,380
>> Not too bad.

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,670
What are we going to talk about today?

5
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,280
>> Well what does the screen say?

6
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,300
>> It looks like a wordle.

7
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,530
>> Yes it's a wordle.

8
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,150
It's generalizing generalizing and
the key words are.

9
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,330
>> Abstraction, scale, search.

10
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,870
>> What we're going to do is I'm
going to try to jump off from some of

11
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,940
the discussions that we had earlier
that you lead, about generalization.

12
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,470
And try to sort of hop up a level above
that and talk about abstraction and

13
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,040
scale and search and sort of the things
that make machine learning and

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,620
reinforcement learning,
in particular, hard.

15
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,780
>> Okay, so, but it seems to me that I
talked about function approximation,

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,410
and everything is
a function approximation.

17
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,000
So, why is there more to say?

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
>> Well, we'll find out.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,258
That's the whole point
of today's lesson.

20
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:43,730
>> [LAUGH] All right.

21
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:44,760
>> Okay, so, let's get going.
