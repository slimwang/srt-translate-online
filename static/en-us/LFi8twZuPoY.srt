1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,070
As human beings, we recall and

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:05,779
use information from our own
experiences to solve problems.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,720
The same is true when we're programming.

4
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:13,219
We must also recall and use information
or data in order to build applications.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,179
As developers,we can do
this by using variables.

6
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:18,050
Consider the following example.

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,339
Let's say I'm cooking tomato soup, and I
have a recipe that makes four servings,

8
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:23,750
but I want to make more soup than that.

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,679
I can define variables that will
calculate the amount of each ingredient

10
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:29,469
I should use.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,344
For example, this line of code creates
a variable called servingsFactor.

12
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:37,354
If you read this moving
from left to right,

13
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:41,754
it says that the servingsFactor is
determined by dividing the desired

14
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:45,765
number of servings by the number
of servings for the recipe.

15
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:50,960
Each of the names, or identifiers, used
in this expression like servingsFactor

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,920
and desired number of
servings are variables.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,210
And we can associate values with
them that help us solve problems.

18
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,410
And that's exactly what we've done here.

19
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:02,829
The number of servings for
the recipe is 4,

20
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,640
and the desired number of servings is 8.

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,599
Let's say the recipe normally calls for
2 pounds of tomatoes.

22
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,809
If we want to calculate how many
pounds of tomatoes we'll need for

23
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,030
our desired number of servings,
which is 8, we can use this calculation.

24
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,900
We'll take the normal amount of
tomatoes needed for the recipe and

25
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,719
multiply it by the servings factor
that we calculated earlier.

26
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,725
If we print this out we can see that
we'll need 4 pounds of tomatoes to make

27
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:32,738
8 servings.

28
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:36,107
Now of course,
this is pretty simple math and

29
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:37,793
we could probably do it in our head.

30
00:01:37,793 --> 00:01:42,545
But a nice benefit of variables is that
they enable use to reuse expressions and

31
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:46,216
formulas, for example,
to calculate the amount needed for

32
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:49,251
multiple ingredients or
on multiple occasions.

33
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:52,631
Let's say I have my entire family
coming over for dinner, and

34
00:01:52,632 --> 00:01:56,540
instead of 8 servings, now I want to
make 16 servings of tomato soup.

35
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:00,536
And we rerun our code with
this small alteration for

36
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:04,375
the desired number of servings,
we can see that we need to use 8 pounds

37
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,126
of tomatoes to make 16
servings of tomato soup.

38
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:08,558
