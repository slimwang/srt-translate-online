00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,680
Welcome to the wonderful
world of Location-Aware apps.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,410
In this lesson, you learn the basics
of using location services,

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,060
including the most parts of setting
it up for use in your app and

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,790
also how to optimize for battery use.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,630
In the next lesson, you'll work through
a simple sample that gets some of

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:22,370
the useful date from location services
that go beyond latitude and longitude.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,700
You can use the techniques that you will
learn to get cool stuff like altitude,

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,610
bearing, and speed.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,380
You'll see more about how location
services give intelligence,

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,740
such as getting the address
at your current location.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,878
These are the beginnings
of understanding context,

12
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:41,015
which will then give you
the ability to do cool stuff,

13
00:00:41,015 --> 00:00:43,814
depending on where your
device is in the world.

14
00:00:43,814 --> 00:00:45,650
Are you ready to get started?

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,160
Let's go.
