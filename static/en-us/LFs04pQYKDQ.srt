1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,672
Some point must have a y value of 0 along this line. 0 is the number that

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:09,870
separates the negative numbers from the positive numbers. And since we know

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,445
that y is negative at A, but positive at B, it has to be 0 somewhere in

4
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:15,387
between.
