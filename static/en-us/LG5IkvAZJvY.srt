00:00:00,485 --> 00:00:03,050
Recall the five rules
of message passing and

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,770
consider an example on the following
linear network which has eight nodes.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,660
Suppose one wants to send
a message to node six

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,360
at exactly the same time node seven
wants to send a message to node four.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,720
What's the minimum time it will take for
these two messages?

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,360
I want you to type your
answer in this box.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,540
And I want you to do it symbolically.

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,140
So for alpha use little a, for beta use
little b, and for n you can just use n.
