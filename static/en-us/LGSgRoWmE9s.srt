1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,576
I should mention that, there've been other attempts at not,

2
00:00:03,576 --> 00:00:06,630
the other pieces of work on finding corners.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,730
In fact, Shi-Tomasi did this nice work on, cornerness, and

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,050
it, it did something different looking at the lambdas,

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,880
instead of using that r, and found local maximums.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,470
And, I will tell you, if any of you who use OpenCV,

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,540
they have something called OpenCV Good Features to Track, it's a function, it

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,480
finds you points in the image, that are good features to, good points to track.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,320
How does it work?

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,220
I'm pretty sure that's the Shi and Tomasi version of this.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,670
It's still based upon the same moment matrix,

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,800
it's just a different use of the eigenvalues.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,870
And, there's reports that maybe it's a slightly better way for

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,820
things that are undergoing certain kinds of deformations.

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
There was another one 2005 Brown, Szeliski and

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,048
Winder, and I write this one because I've stolen so many of these pictures from

17
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,830
Rick Szeliski's book, I feel like I have to put this in there.

18
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:55,206
It again looked at eigenvectors in another slightly different way, and

19
00:00:55,206 --> 00:00:58,247
there are other, types of, of corner detectors.
