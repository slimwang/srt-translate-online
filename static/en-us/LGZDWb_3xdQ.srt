1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,250
First.

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:06,340
The longer the system is in use, the
more it learns about network activity.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:12,040
This statement's true, because anomaly
detection involves first learning or

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,690
profiling what is normal.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,260
The longer the system is in use,
the better it can learn what is normal.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,230
Second, if malicious activity looks
like normal traffic to the system,

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,270
it will not detect an attack.

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:31,930
This is true, because anomaly detection,
detects what looks not like normal.

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,650
Therefore, if an attack
managed to look like normal,

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,710
then the anomaly detection system will
not be able to detect this attack.

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,480
The third statement,
false positive can become a problem,

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,050
normal usage can be mistaken for
an attack.

13
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,680
This is true.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,800
Because the definition of
false positive is that,

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,590
a normal activity is
mistaken as an attack.

16
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,850
At the minimum, false positives
can waste systems time, because

17
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,300
the system needs to investigate whether
there's truly an intrusion or not.
