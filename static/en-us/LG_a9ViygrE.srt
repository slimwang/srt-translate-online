1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,290
So, let's assume we have some sort of a surface normal, okay?

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,990
So, here we have our surface normal drawn and it is on a surface, okay?

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,360
If we have a point on a surface, we can define two tangents, all right?

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,570
One is, if I take a step just in the x direction, there's a question of,

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,970
how does z change?

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,625
So, if I step in the x direction, no change in y.

7
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:26,900
Then my change in z will just be the partial z with respect to x.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,570
And so that's negative p.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,920
So tangent in the x direction.

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,270
So it's on the surface, let's draw ourselves a little surface here.

11
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,000
Put a point here.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And this is one tangent vector, okay?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,370
Well the other tangent vector we can have is we just take a step headed in

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,380
the y direction then there's how the z changes as a function of y.

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,410
And that's negative q.

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,990
And so that would be another tangent.

17
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,550
So if I want to find the surface normal, that's easy to do.

18
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,610
I just take the cross product of those two directions.

19
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,880
By the way, these vectors they're not,

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,530
I haven't made them unit vectors or anything.

21
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,790
They're just taking one, a step that goes 1 in the x direction and

22
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,160
changes however much it does in z, same thing for the y.

23
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,690
So if I want a unit normal, what I have to do is I have take tx cross ty.

24
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,790
So I, remember, the cross product of two,

25
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,960
two vectors is perpendicular to that right?

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,260
So I take tx cross ty.

27
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:26,050
And if I want it to be a unit vector, I have to normalize it by the magnitude.

28
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:26,760
Okay?

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,350
And so, when you take tx cross ty, you get pq1.

30
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,530
And the magnitude of that,

31
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,870
of cour, course, is the square root of p squared plus q squared plus 1.

32
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,100
By the way, so the reason I used the minus partial respect to z.

33
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,990
Respect to x and y.

34
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,110
Is, that allows my normal to be p,q, 1.

35
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,670
If I do it the other way, it would be minus p, minus q, 1.

36
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,240
So, same difference.

37
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,550
So that's the algebraic description of p and q.

38
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,770
And that's important, because we're going to use it.

39
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,330
But it's also important to understand the geometric interpretation.

40
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,620
Because when we reason about multiple constraints,

41
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,450
it'll be easier to think about that.

42
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,100
To do that, I have to introduce something called the Gaussian Sphere.
