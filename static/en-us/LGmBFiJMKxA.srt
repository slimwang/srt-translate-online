There are a number of ways to do this problem. I'm going to show you one of

2
00:00:04,018 --> 00:00:08,337
them. I can factor a 6a from the first two terms, leaving me with 4a minus bc in

3
00:00:08,337 --> 00:00:12,914
the parentheses. For the second parentheses, I could try pulling out a positive

4
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:16,779
5, but that would leave me with a negative 4a as my first term. I want a

5
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:21,293
positive 4a here. So instead of factoring a positive 5, let's factor a negative

6
00:00:21,293 --> 00:00:26,172
5. If I factor a negative 5, I'll be left with 4a and negative bc. Here's where

7
00:00:26,172 --> 00:00:30,803
you want to be really careful and check. If we distribute both of the terms, we

8
00:00:30,803 --> 00:00:35,712
should wind up with we started with. Most importantly, I'm concerned about this

9
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:40,358
last term. I have negative 5 times negative bc. A negative times a negative is a

10
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:45,352
positive. So yes, this is correct. Finally, we factor out our 4a minus bc, which

11
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:49,828
leaves us with this expression. So these are my two factors, and this is the

12
00:00:49,828 --> 00:00:51,581
expression in factored form.
