00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,330
Let's look at the answer. A bank account

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,050
number, that sounds pretty unique. So that could be

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,990
a good candidate to have as a keyname/ID. A

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,930
date, is probably not a good keyname/ID, because it's

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,500
most likely not unique across the entities. But

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,440
it could be. It all depends on the modeling,

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,370
of course. The price, does not sound like a

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,290
good keyname/ID either for the same reasons I stated.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,060
An email address. Yeah, that could be a good keyname/ID. Because it's

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,880
very likely, it's unique across entities. All right. I hope you did well.
