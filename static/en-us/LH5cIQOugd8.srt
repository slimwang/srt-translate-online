1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,220
Recall the initial sorting phase, or

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,960
Phase 1 of the external
memory merge sort scheme.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,657
You first partition the chunks,
and then for each chunk,

4
00:00:08,657 --> 00:00:12,400
you read it into fast memory,
sort it, and write out the result.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,435
In this quiz, I want you to count
the number of asymptotic transfers and

6
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:19,635
comparisons incurred at each step.

7
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:21,385
That is, in each of these boxes,

8
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:25,425
I want you to enter the number
of slow fast memory transfers or

9
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:30,007
the number of comparisons
aggregated over all iterations.

10
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:33,327
Enter them symbolically
in the big O sense.

11
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:37,807
Enter your answer in terms of n, z and L
and maybe other numerical constants, but

12
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:39,400
ignore f.

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,540
F was just some fudge constant to make
sure that the size of the input buffers

14
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,240
fit into fast memory along with any
extra working space we might need.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,740
And just to repeat,

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,260
enter your answer as totals taken
over all n over Z iterations.

17
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,180
For simplicity, you can assume that
everything divides everything else.

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,950
Or to be more precise, the L divides
f times z, and f times z divides n.

19
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,170
Lastly, assume that the local sort
is an optimal comparison-based sort.
