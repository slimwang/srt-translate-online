00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,640
Remember when we talked about
the creative vision for Android?

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,640
One of the pillars was enchant me,

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,630
that feeling that the app
was made just for you.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,020
Joanna makes a good point.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,880
Right now,
Sunshine is pretty basic in this regard.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,990
Setting your location isn't exactly
customizing it just for you.

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,790
It's just basic functionality.

8
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:19,922
So what can we do?

9
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:24,770
Ideally we'd want something visual,
that impacts the whole application.

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,370
In fact, our weather icons,

11
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,200
which are used throughout the app,
are perfect for this.

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,840
What better way to customize than allow
users to change the very way they

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,200
see the weather.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,230
So let's add the ability
to change icon packs.

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,310
We'll keep our APK size small by
downloading the images from the Internet

16
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,990
using our current included
icons only as a fallback.

17
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,615
Oh, we actually haven't
talked about downloading or

18
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:50,520
displaying images from
the Internet at all.

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,490
Well, let's start there.
