1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,662
This last choice is correct. Fantastic reasoning if you figured that one out. As

2
00:00:04,662 --> 00:00:09,562
an example, the first number could be 4 and the second one could be 0. We know 4

3
00:00:09,562 --> 00:00:15,195
times 0 equals 0. And let's say the second number is 5. 0 times 5 equals 0. Now,

4
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:20,403
I don't actually know that one of the numbers is 4 or the other is 5, but one of

5
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:23,323
them must equal 0, since our product is 0.
