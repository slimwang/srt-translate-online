1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,860
So the answer is the first three are correct. We want to get

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,850
started programming, and we'll get started

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,030
programming very soon. The most important

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,930
thing is to learn some computer science concepts, and we'll do that

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,760
as we get started programming as well as along the way. And

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,470
the third goal is to write code to extract a link from

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,820
a web page. That'll be the first thing that we do to

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,750
start building our search engine, and collecting the corpus that we'll need

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,180
for the search engine. The fourth choice is not true. We're not going

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,200
to get to the point where we write code to rank

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,998
webpages this unit. That's something that we'll be covering in unit six.
