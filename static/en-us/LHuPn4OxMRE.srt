1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,840
So the conundrum question
was largely a warm up,

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,960
making sure he's able to write basic
code, knows a language well enough.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,590
He ended up knowing it really well and
it's also a good way to check if

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,280
the candidate knows how
to write good test cases.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,590
So Phillip did really well in
pulling up positive test cases where

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,480
the function succeeded and
negative test cases.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,930
So those were the main things
I was looking for in that.
