1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,180
And how do you make sure that your queries

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,670
work on appspot? Do you manually edit the index configuration

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,550
file? Do you run the queries on localhost first,

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,040
before you update your app to appspot? Do you annotate

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,329
the properties that you want to be auto indexed

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,090
as at auto index in the entity file? And do

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,130
you just not worry about the single property queries? And

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,980
by that I mean you don't worry about creating indexes

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,390
for queries that only use a single property. Go ahead and check all that apply.
