00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,830
Firebase Notifications is a tool to
send targeted notifications in your app.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,599
Built on Firebase Cloud Messaging,

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:10,179
Firebase Notifications lets you
send notifications to your users.

4
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:13,400
As you'll soon see, configuring
Firebase Notifications requires

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,730
very little code to get started.

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,579
And you'll primarily use the Firebase
console to actually handle sending

7
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:19,729
messages.

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,469
There you have a lot of control.

9
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:24,559
You can send a notification to
all users, groups of users, or

10
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,329
even just a single user.

11
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:28,089
You can even use analytics to determine,

12
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:30,620
which groups of users should
be sent notifications.

13
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,370
For example, you may want to target
just users, who made an in-app purchase.

14
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,429
Perhaps you want to send them
a notification about a special offer.

15
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:41,670
In order to encourage them to
make more in-app purchases and

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,649
have more user engagement.

17
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,259
After sending this notification,

18
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:48,079
you can then check back in
the analytics console to see your data.

19
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:52,599
And you can use that data to actually
determine how the notification affected

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,050
user engagement.

21
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:57,659
Analytics automatically records, when
a notification is in the foreground.

22
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:01,769
When it's received, when it is open,
and when it's been dismissed.

23
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,880
Which provides you in depth engagement
data on notifications sent to users.

24
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,949
So, as you can see
Firebase Notifications and

25
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,490
analytics go hand in hand to
boost your user engagement
