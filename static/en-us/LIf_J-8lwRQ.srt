1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,460
It's time to look back at updating our
forecast view in phone landscape mode.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,860
What we have now with a huge app bar,
gives the user almost no context

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,270
to use the list, and the list contains
a huge amount of white space.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,160
The design that we have for
the forecast landscape you eliminate,

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,900
is most of the app bar.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,840
Placing it underneath
the scrolling list.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,870
We're going to fix the width of
our forecast list at 360 dp.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,180
This isn't as bad as it might sound,
since the whole goal for

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,125
this is to eliminate
interior white space.

10
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:36,495
And this guarantees that the interior
white space is constant.

11
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:40,095
We're eventually going to pad
the top of the list by 16dp.

12
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:42,315
But we'll save that for later.

13
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:45,515
We're going to do these changes
inside of the forecast fragment,

14
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:47,765
inside of the layout land directory,

15
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:51,995
because the next code pull moves
the app bar layout into the fragment.
