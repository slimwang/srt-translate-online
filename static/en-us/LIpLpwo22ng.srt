1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,029
The package would cost $56.25. Great work if you found that price. This price

2
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,428
also makes sense, since our package weighs more and it's longer in length. So it

3
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:15,965
should definitely cost more than $20 to ship. We want to start by setting up a

4
00:00:15,965 --> 00:00:21,342
proportion that has direct variation. The cost varies directly with the length.

5
00:00:21,342 --> 00:00:25,170
And the cost varies directly with the weight. The next thing that we want to do

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,203
is make a list of the things we know. We know the first cost was $20.00, the

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:33,950
length was four feet, and it measured 10 pounds. Next we fill in the proportion

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,126
with the remaining pieces. The second cost, the second length, and the second

9
00:00:38,126 --> 00:00:42,220
weight of the package. We make a list of those amounts as well. We're looking

10
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,880
for the cost of our package, so that's going to be x. The length of that package

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,462
is seven and a half feet. And the weight of that package is 15 pounds. Now we're

12
00:00:50,462 --> 00:00:54,760
ready to fill in our proportion. Plugging in these amounts into our proportion,

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,550
we get this equation. I'm going to clean up the right hand side of my equation

14
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:05,316
first. Four times ten is 40. And 7.5 times 15 is 112.5. So I've written this

15
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:10,782
cleaned up part over here. Next we cross multiply to get 2,250 equals 40x and

16
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:15,743
finally we divide both sides by 40 to get our final answer.
