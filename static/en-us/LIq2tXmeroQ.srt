1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,196
Hereâ€™s another real world data set, this is the

2
00:00:03,196 --> 00:00:05,259
Space Shuttle Challenger and some of you

3
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:09,499
might remember on January 28, 1986, it

4
00:00:09,499 --> 00:00:11,570
exploded and was destroyed and seven

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,820
astronauts on board passed away. So,

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,873
this example of would be one where the

7
00:00:15,873 --> 00:00:17,632
question is whether a good set

8
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:21,260
decision, could have predicted this disaster

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,516
and saved the lives of the astronauts on board.

10
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:27,244
On the day of this tragic launch, the

11
00:00:27,244 --> 00:00:30,999
temperature was unusually low, at 36

12
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:33,166
degrees Fahrenheit. So, the NASA

13
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,966
engineers asked themselves, do we

14
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:37,531
have data from past flights to see if this

15
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:40,618
temperature could cause problems.

16
00:00:40,618 --> 00:00:43,160
They graphed the temperature Xi versus

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,196
the number of O-rings that had failed

18
00:00:46,196 --> 00:00:47,955
in the past, because those were

19
00:00:47,955 --> 00:00:50,697
known to be affected by temperature.

20
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:53,322
In seven flights there were failures; in

21
00:00:53,322 --> 00:00:55,787
fact, sometimes they failed twice and

22
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:57,097
sometimes only one of them failed.

23
00:00:57,097 --> 00:00:59,845
And the temperatures were all over

24
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:06,604
the map, 70, 57, 63, 70, 53, 75 and 58.

25
00:01:06,604 --> 00:01:08,287
Now, these were all the cases where

26
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:09,738
a problem occurred and the question

27
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:11,222
was, would the lower temperature

28
00:01:11,222 --> 00:01:13,405
increase the chances of a problem

29
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:16,559
occurring? Now, as a good statistician,

30
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:18,453
what do we do? Linear regression?

31
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,212
Do we compute confidence intervals?

32
00:01:20,212 --> 00:01:21,676
Or do we find a maximum likelihood

33
00:01:21,676 --> 00:01:23,557
estimator. Check exactly one

34
00:01:23,557 --> 00:01:27,000
box of the most appropriate term.
