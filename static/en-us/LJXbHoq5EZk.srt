00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] Now it turns out this is not an easy thing to do and

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
obviously I think it might be to complete all this normalized alphas,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
but you still have to be able to sample from those.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So, in the spectrum of our alphas you might draw a random variable

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
uniformly from the interval 0;1, and then find out the alpha

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so that all the alphas leading up to it, and some are smaller than beta,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but if we add the new alpha to the sum you would get a value larger than beta.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now that's doable. It's inefficient.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In the best case you get an N lock and implementation.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let me show you what is commonly done, and I don't take any guaranty

11
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that it's entirely unbiased, but there's a very simple trick.
