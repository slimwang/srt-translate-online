1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,190
So some of the first sort of systematic
experiments were done by these folks,

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,130
Wright and Guild in the 20s.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,150
Although the experiments people know
about are a little bit later in the 30s.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,830
They were trying to map this notion of
wavelength to perceived color, right.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,460
So this is what I was
telling you about before,

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,780
where as I change the wavelength.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,680
How much do you have to change the RGB
in order for you to say that they match?

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,560
And they were allowed you to be
able to say two colors are more

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,500
similar to each other
through this process, and

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,560
they define what is called
the CIE color space.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,460
CIE actually stands for commission on
illumination or something in French, and

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,920
that's why its CIE.

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,360
So the diagram they came up with
here this is called their xy

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,260
chromaticity diagram.

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,180
Couple things to notice and we'll talk
about what x and y are in a minute.

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,550
These are the colors at,
as the wavelengths go around, right?

17
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,570
So you're getting longer and
longer wavelengths, right.

18
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,010
And you get back to here.

19
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,450
So the numbers around the,
these blue numbers around the border,

20
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,760
those are the wavelengths.

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,650
And the middle is what you get
by blending different colors.

22
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,870
Now what do we mean by blending?

23
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,750
Well, what they figured out when they
were looking at people computing

24
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,930
playing with these RGB lights, and other
things was they came up with a new color

25
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,870
space that wasn't just RGB, but
that it was going to be a linear

26
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,850
transform of RGB, but that the prominent
value was going to be called Y.

27
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:19,990
What does Y stand for?

28
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,975
It stands for luminance.

29
00:01:20,975 --> 00:01:23,280
Don't ask me why it is?

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,800
Because it's actually
from the XYZ space, and

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,540
the idea is that Y is the luminance.

32
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,475
And so then X and Z were two other
quantities with which you be,

33
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:37,760
bet, between X, Z, and
Y you could figure out the color.

34
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,320
And you could represent
a wide range of colors, and

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,010
in fact in this diagram that
I was showing you before.

36
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,610
You notice down here it says x and
y well,

37
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,430
it was just this x normalized by
the sum and y normalized by the sum.

38
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,620
And so in some sense it's for
sort of a fixed luminance,

39
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,850
it's taking the luminance out of it.

40
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,710
And you can see as you move into the
middle oh, you can't see that at all,

41
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,640
because it's red drawing on red.

42
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,020
As you come to the middle
you're blending all these and

43
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,590
that's going to be white and we'll talk,
or gray depending on the luminance and

44
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,300
we'll talk about that in the minute.
