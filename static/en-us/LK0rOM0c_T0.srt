00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,362
Here, the correct answers were 1 plus or minus root 3, all divided by 2. You

2
00:00:05,362 --> 00:00:09,583
may have listed your answer as 1 half plus or minus root 3 divided by 2. These

3
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:13,190
would be correct as well. To solve this equation, we need to first start by

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,200
setting it equal to 0. So we'll subtract 1 from both sides. We identify a, b,

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,288
and c using the coefficients in front of each term. a is positive 2, b is

6
00:00:23,288 --> 00:00:28,343
negative 2, and c is negative 1. We do the negative of b, which would be

7
00:00:28,343 --> 00:00:34,637
positive 2, and then, plus or minus b squared minus 4ac, all divided by 2a. We

8
00:00:34,637 --> 00:00:39,101
simplify our answer by cleaning up this radical to get 2 plus or minus root 4

9
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:45,596
plus 8, all divided by 4. Negative 2 squared is 4 here. And negative 4 times 2

10
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:51,374
times negative 1 is positive 8. This radical simplifies to root 12, which is 2

11
00:00:51,374 --> 00:00:56,222
times root 3. These two terms share a common factor of 2, so we can rewrite our

12
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:01,368
numerator as 2 times 1 plus or minus 1 root 3. We notice that the numerator and

13
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:04,715
denominator share a common factor of 2, so we simplify that to 1, leaving us

14
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:06,990
with this expression.
