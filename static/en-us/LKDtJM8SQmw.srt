00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] And the answer is yes, F is independent of A.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What we find for our rules of D-separation is that F is dependent on D

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and A is dependent on D.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But if you don't know D, you can't govern any dependence between A and F at all.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If you do know D, then F and A become dependent.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And the reason is B and E are dependent given D,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and we can transform this back into dependence of A and F

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
because B and A are dependent and E and F are dependent.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There is an active path between A and F which goes across here and here

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
because D is known.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If we know G, the same thing is true because G gives us knowledge about D,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and D can be applied back to this path over here.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
However, if you know H, that's not the case.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So H might tell us something about G,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
but it doesn't tell us anything about D,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and therefore, we have no reason to close the path between A and F.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The path between A and F is still passive, even though we have knowledge of H.
