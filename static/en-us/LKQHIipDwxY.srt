1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,059
So we've learned about using
transforms inside of Unity scripts.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,152
Now it's time to test your knowledge.

3
00:00:06,152 --> 00:00:07,832
What does the translate method do?

4
00:00:07,832 --> 00:00:09,610
What are the options, Chris?

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,010
&gt;&gt; Does the translate method
rotate things around?

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,510
Does it scale them or does it move them?
