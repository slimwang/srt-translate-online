1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:04,022
2. Now for each node in the frontier, how many neighbors does it have?

2
00:00:04,022 --> 00:00:06,310
This is slightly more complex but still straightforward.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,183
You only need the array R.

4
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:10,347
How do you compute the number of neighbors per vertex

5
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:13,076
using array R and vertex number V?
