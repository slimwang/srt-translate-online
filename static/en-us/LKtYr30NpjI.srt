00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,760
At Udacity we've used
this slogan in the past.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,470
Learn.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,150
Think.

4
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,240
Do.

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,990
And it definitely still applies today.

6
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,050
There's no better way to
learn than by doing, so for

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,570
this next quiz you are going
to do some placeholders.

8
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,430
You'll be given a little input that
prompts users to type in the name

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,510
of an event.

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,220
And I want you to give it
the placeholder event name.

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,940
Make sure you test on your
mobile devices, and once again,

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,550
check the links in the instructor notes
if you need help getting started.
