1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,410
For example, when the frequency knob is turned,

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,730
which was event four, three responses are required.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,340
The physical knob ends up in a new position. The radio channel must be changed.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,090
And the white vertical line indicating the current station must be moved.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,760
The position of the vertical bar is in the province of

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,860
a different machine from the one that was recording the moving of the knob.

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,460
Somehow, it must be, this, this other state must be informed of the new station.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,460
This can be accomplished by using, by issuing a new internal event which

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,900
we'll just call event A to which the station machine responds.
