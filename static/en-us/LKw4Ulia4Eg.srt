00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,410
v Would equal w divided by at minus 1. Great effort for getting that one

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:10,287
correct. When we multiplied both sides by the lowest common denominator, or vt,

3
00:00:10,287 --> 00:00:16,268
we can see that these two factors will cancel. We're left with avt equals v plus

4
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:20,730
w. We subtract v from both sides to solve for v, or really to isolate it on one

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,750
side of the equation. Now that we're here, we have to factor this V out. When we

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,250
factor the V out, we'll have V times AT minus one, and then we can divide by

7
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:35,507
this quantity to get one V alone. V would equal this expression. Keep in mind,

8
00:00:35,507 --> 00:00:39,673
this is simplifying the one. I hope you're becoming a pro at these.
