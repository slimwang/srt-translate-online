1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,780
Now let us consider, the processing of the fourth example comes along.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,520
Again the red outline shows that this is a negative example of the constant.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,400
Because this is a negative example, we must specialize in most journal

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,880
concept characterizations available at the moment. We can begin by checking,

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,480
whether we need to specialize this particular general concept. But wait,

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,280
this general concept characterization, already excludes the negative example.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,780
This says the earlier happens when I go to Sam's, and this has Bob's in it, so

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,600
this already excludes it, I don't have to specialize it any more.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,737
Now let's look at this general model. Does this need to be specialized,

10
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:41,050
in order to excluded? Yes, because at the current stage, this includes this

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,940
vertical example. It is cheap here, this is cheap, this is any here, and this

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,400
has particle elements within. This means that, this concept characterization,

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,190
must be specialized in a way that excludes this negative example and yet.

14
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,590
The new specialization, is consistent with the most specialized characterization

15
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:04,290
at present. It is tempting to see the two pathways as converging here,

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,790
because this is identical to that, but we also have this branch hanging, and

17
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,720
this branch says that I'm allergic to any meal at Sam's, not just a cheap meal.

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,650
So, we're not done yet. In this state there is one other element to consider.

19
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,760
If there is a node, that lies on a pathway starting from the most journal

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,330
concept characterization, that is subsumed by a node, that comes from

21
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,660
another pathway starting from the same journal concept characterization, then I

22
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,390
want to prune that particular node. The reason I wanted to put on this note is,

23
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,820
because this note is subsumed by this note. So this note is true,

24
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,040
I don't have to carry this around. If I'm allergic to any meat at Sam's,

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,120
I don't have to specify that I'm allergic to cheap meat at Sam's, thus I can

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,460
pull on this particular pathway, and I've left it only this particular pathway.

27
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,930
At this point in processing, these are the examples that have been encountered

28
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:01,120
so far. There are only two possible. I'm either allergic to everything at Sam's,

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,530
or I'm allergic to every cheap meal at Sam's.
