00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,934
>> Oh, so Andy, it sounds like our senseletes are getting ready for the final

2
00:00:02,934 --> 00:00:06,665
events. Let's go back to Susan and see what's going on. Back to you, Susan.

3
00:00:06,665 --> 00:00:11,197
>> Hi, you guys. It's really exciting over here. As you can see, we're getting set

4
00:00:11,197 --> 00:00:14,308
up with the eye charts, and the athletes are warming up for the first sight

5
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:15,794
event.

6
00:00:15,794 --> 00:00:18,982
>> And how does this event work?

7
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:21,958
>> Well, actually you can see the charts have letters with different sizes on

8
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:23,095
them.

9
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:27,060
>> The contestants have to read the letters, and those that can read the smallest

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,605
letters get more points awarded. They have to read those without glasses.

11
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:34,605
>> Any comments from what you've seen so far in this event?

12
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:38,325
>> It's actually pretty interesting how dramatically different some of our

13
00:00:38,325 --> 00:00:42,442
contestants are. For example, some cannot even read the largest letters, where

14
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,075
some can read almost all of the smallest ones.

15
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:48,480
>> Yeah, it looks like some of our contestants are nearsighted huh, Susan?

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,231
>> You're definitely right Andy. It's a good thing these contestants can wear

17
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:55,344
their glasses when they're not at these events.

18
00:00:55,344 --> 00:00:57,089
>> Lucky indeed. Thanks a lot Susan.
