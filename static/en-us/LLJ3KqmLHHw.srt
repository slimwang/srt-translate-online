1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,910
As an example consider this
portfolio where we have Google,

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,460
Apple, Gold, and Exxon from the
beginning of 2010 to the end of 2010.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,370
This is what the performance of
that portfolio would look like

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:18,910
in the blue line, if we had
an equal allocation to each asset.

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,590
So, we gave 25% to each of those
stocks at the beginning, and

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,650
then we observed at the end,
the total performance.

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,690
And we include a chart here for
S&P 500 for comparison.

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,980
Now, this is an un-optimized portfolio.

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,830
Here's what it would look like
if we optimized for sharp ratio.

10
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,120
Look at that.
Look how much

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,326
higher performance we get compared
to our benchmark S&P 500.

12
00:00:44,326 --> 00:00:49,789
And observe over here
the allocations to the assets.

13
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:57,010
60% goes to Gold, 40% to Apple and
none to Google or Exxon.

14
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,940
Now, one thing to emphasize here is,
this is looking back in time,

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,900
so we're looking back historically.

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,730
What happened in 2010 and
observing at the beginning of 2010,

17
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,050
if we knew what we knew now,
how should we best allocate?

18
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,650
So, there's a question as to

19
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,800
how much this can help our
portfolio going forward.

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,880
And I'll give you that
answer ahead of time.

21
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,790
Indeed, when we optimize for
sharp ratio, hold that portfolio,

22
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,630
rebalance, in other words re-optimize
that sharp ratio and continue that month

23
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,030
by month, we very often,
most frequently see that that improves

24
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,220
the performance of the portfolio
versus just an equal allocation.

25
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,710
But I do want to observe that
this is computing back in time,

26
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,050
so, yes, of course we can
find a better portfolio,

27
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,890
but indeed it helps
going forward as well.
