1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,200
Well if you have, you'll notice that this is a panorama.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,790
It's referred to as a planar rect,

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,680
rectilinear panorama, where all the lines are still straight.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,680
This is a rotational, spherical, or a cylindrical panorama.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,790
As you notice, it seems to be like if you were at one point,

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,180
the whole panorama is rotating around it.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,860
This is referred to as a path, route or a multiview panorama, and

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,880
this is somebody driving in a car and actually now stitching slices together.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,021
And of course, it looks like something you'll have best views as

10
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:29,690
a move from one place to the other.

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,100
This is a vertical panorama.

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,730
In this case, the panorama is moved up and down, or at least the camera is

13
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,360
moved up and down to capture height of something much larger.

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,320
This is not a panorama, itâ€™s a single shot.
