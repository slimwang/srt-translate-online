00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,034
Well, if we want our function to decrease things by 3 then we should take our

2
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:10,258
input x and subtract 3 form it. So our return value or our output should be x

3
00:00:10,258 --> 00:00:15,756
minus 3. Let's play around. If I say, I want to figure out decrease by 3 And

4
00:00:15,756 --> 00:00:21,626
have the input be, four, then sure enough I get one. Let's do a couple more. We

5
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:25,842
can see that in both of these cases, the number that is output is 3 lower than

6
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:29,834
the number that is input. Which is exactly what we wanted to have happen.
