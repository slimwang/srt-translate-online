A farmer has irrigation systems that work for circular fields. He wants to lay

2
00:00:04,486 --> 00:00:07,066
out the fields, so that he wastes as little land as possible and wastes no

3
00:00:07,066 --> 00:00:11,146
water at all. So, the fields can't overlap and there can't be factional fields

4
00:00:11,146 --> 00:00:15,170
because then he will be watering somebody else's lands. He is looking at many

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,730
different pieces of land and computing how many circular fields will fit on a

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,823
rectangular piece of land. It's a bit of a pain. Let's write a program to help.
