00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,539
That brings us to a, a quiz.

2
00:00:01,539 --> 00:00:03,943
Let's consider these two stereo pairs.

3
00:00:03,943 --> 00:00:05,361
We have the top one,

4
00:00:05,361 --> 00:00:10,803
which you know the cameras are verged, because those lines intersect.

5
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:14,904
But the bottom one, I'm going to tell you is from a pair of,

6
00:00:14,904 --> 00:00:19,360
an image pair, a stereo pair that has coplanar image planes.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,257
And the question is how do you know that image B has a parallel image planes?

8
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:26,605
And I'll give you three choices.

9
00:00:26,605 --> 00:00:30,238
A, the epipolar lines are horizontal.

10
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:33,836
B, the epipolar lines are parallel.

11
00:00:33,836 --> 00:00:37,380
And C, because I just said, B had parallel image planes.
