>> He's decided that the best way to solve the slingshot sign problem is to use

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:08,095
math. If he can come up with an equation describing the trajectory of a ball

3
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:12,190
that makes it through the hoop, he'll be able to find every single point that

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,426
the ball has to pass through to get there. And this will tell him exactly where

5
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:20,974
not to hang his lovely new sign. If we call the horizontal position of the ball

6
00:00:20,974 --> 00:00:25,636
at any given time x, and we call its vertical position at the same time y, then

7
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:30,298
here's a list of the x and y values of the ball at different points throughout

8
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:34,871
its trajectory. If we think of the space above the ground at Grant's display

9
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:39,351
booth as an x y coordinate plane, where x is horizontal and y is vertical, then

10
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:43,801
these are just the points that the ball passes through on its way to the hoop.

11
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:47,711
Looking at the coordinates of these points, do you think that we can find a

12
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:51,389
linear equation that goes through all them? Please answer yes or no.
