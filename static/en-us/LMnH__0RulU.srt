00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,990
Hope this wasn't too difficult.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,939
Yes, the code is 007.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,110
Now let's see how we got that.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,840
First, convert the images from color to grayscale.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,520
And then use the edge function to compute the edges individually for each image.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,920
Note that I've explicitly passed in canny.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,880
The default is I think sobel, which doesn't work as well.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,250
Canny accepts additional arguments, the hysteresis values and smoothing sigma.

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,290
Feel free to play with them.

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,030
Here are frizzy's edges.

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,850
This is almost perfect.

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,220
Note that around the mouth and

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,250
nose, where we had thick outlines, we have double edges.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,000
This is expected.

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,850
And here's froomer's edges, also pretty good.

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,410
Okay. Now what?

17
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,440
Note that edge images are binary images.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,830
Which means you can and them together to find common edge pixels.

19
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,250
And there you go.

20
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,490
You never know what's hiding in an image or two.
