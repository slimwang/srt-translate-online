1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And now we need a calculator--you have a square root of 28 and you divide -1

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
by that square root and gets approximately -0.189 when I work this out.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today's negative correlation but it's weak. The data really in't well-described by a linear function.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If the data instead were to lie exactly on this line then r will be -1 with the negative correlation.
