00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,727
Here is the French flag with three colors blue, white, and red. So, here it

2
00:00:05,727 --> 00:00:09,640
looks like we have to make three decisions. Are we in the first third, the

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,930
middle third, or the last one? In java you would start out with the first

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:19,061
condition, and I'll leave it to you to fill in the details in the exercise.

5
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:23,093
Then, for the next part, you'll use an else if clause, so you simply write else

6
00:00:23,093 --> 00:00:29,187
if followed by another condition. And finally, you use an else for the

7
00:00:29,187 --> 00:00:35,065
remaining possibility. So, here you need to supply two conditions, is the point

8
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:38,665
in the left, is it in the middle or otherwise, of course, it has to be in the

9
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:45,998
rightmost part. This construction with if, else if. You can have other answers

10
00:00:45,998 --> 00:00:50,638
if you'd like. And then, finally is a else. This is what you do anytime you get

11
00:00:50,638 --> 00:00:54,688
multiple decisions. And I get worked down from the top to the bottom as you

12
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:59,035
would expect. The first condition gets checked if it's fulfilled the statement

13
00:00:59,035 --> 00:01:03,724
is executed in here, and everything else is skipped. On the other hand, if the

14
00:01:03,724 --> 00:01:07,429
first condition wasn't true, one would move to check the second condition and

15
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:12,697
if that one was true, it would be executed. If it wasn't, then the third one

16
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:17,496
would be executed. In other words, exactly one of these three blocks is

17
00:01:17,496 --> 00:01:24,010
executed, depending on which condition is true or whether none of them is true.

18
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,819
Well, now it's your turn to try that with the French flag. Again, you'll be

19
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:34,244
given a point x y that could fall anywhere within the flag. And you need to

20
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:40,836
make a decision whether to return blue, white, or red. And when you do that be

21
00:01:40,836 --> 00:01:45,363
sure to use an if, else if, else construction.
