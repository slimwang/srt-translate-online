00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,130
I'm sitting here with Nick Artman.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,740
He's one of our
front-end web developers.

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,790
Thanks for sitting with me.

4
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:05,840
>> Absolutely.

5
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,880
>> So,
tell me a little bit about refactoring.

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,992
What's one way that
you might go about it?

7
00:00:10,992 --> 00:00:15,300
>> So, refactoring is the process by
which you take a piece of code and make

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,020
it more readable and more maintainable
without changing its functionality.

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,270
So that means, you might want to
break up large functions,

10
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,680
or complicated functions without
changing the way that they're

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,830
accessed by the outside world or the
other components of your application.

12
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,220
>> Got it.
So basically you're taking

13
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,440
the organization, which we'll say in
this case is already all right, and

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,690
you're taking the big unmaintainable or
difficult to understand functions and

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,110
you're breaking them up.

16
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,790
But it's important not to change
things in terms of the way

17
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,890
the components interact with each other,
right?

18
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,830
>> Precisely, this makes sure that you
increase readability, maintain ability

19
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,960
and ease of working with your code but
without breaking the contract that you

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,210
have between you and the other
developers you're working with.

21
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,980
>> And the contract that the pieces of
the app have with each other as well.

22
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,860
>> Exactly.

23
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,390
>> Awesome,
that sounds like a good method.

24
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,670
Thank you for sitting with me.

25
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,170
>> Absolutely.
