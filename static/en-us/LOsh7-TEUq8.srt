1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,480
So, you might say, woah, didn't we already do this?

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,720
We did the ideal perspective projection, where we said that some value

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,200
u was just going to be the focal length times x divided by z, and v was,

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,030
was y divided by z multiplied by f, as well.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,010
So you might ask, aren't we done?

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,080
Well, no, because that would be in some idealized world.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,360
The first problem going back to here is, f might be in, you know,

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,720
millimeters, so we might have a ten millimeter lens, or a 50 millimeter lens,

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,950
but the pixels, the screen pixels, they're in some arbitrary coordinate, right?

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,790
That depends upon exactly how many pixels we get per millimeter in the sensor.

11
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,740
So the first thing that happens is that we introduce an alpha that's just

12
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,180
going to scale that value, because we don't really know what f is.

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,330
Now sometimes people will give you an f,

14
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,530
a focal length, in pixels, which is kind of a weird thing.

15
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,830
But what they're actually doing is,

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:00,000
they're giving you this combined value that is sort of the conversion from

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,700
millimeters to pixels times millimeters, just given to you, and pixels.

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,730
But basically, because they may be in some arbitrary units,

19
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,170
we have a scale factor alpha.

20
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,380
So that's one degree of freedom.

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,850
But, who said the pixels are square?

22
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,250
Megan, did you say pixels are square?

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:14,940
No.

24
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:20,081
Now, it turns out pixels are more square now than they used to be.

25
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:22,700
They used to be cool and now they're, nah, never mind.

26
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,836
Anyway, pixels are more square now than they used to be.

27
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:27,050
The used to be, back in television, more of television days,

28
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,610
pixels had the same aspect ratio as actually a television.

29
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,310
So a pixel was wider than it was tall, and

30
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,450
some other things, they were taller than they were wide.

31
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,140
They weren't necessarily fixed.

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,600
In fact, even some CCD arrays that I calibrated once,

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,900
it turned out that well, it was almost square.

34
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,910
It was like 95% of the height was equal to the width, all right?

35
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,850
So because they're not exactly square, you might have a separate scaling factor

36
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,130
between the u direction and the v direction.

37
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,710
And so now we've introduced beta.

38
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,960
So now we have two degrees of freedom.

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,670
But we're not done.

40
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,515
Next, well you remember we put the center of projection,

41
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:08,250
when we were doing the ideal projection.

42
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,020
We put the center projection right at the camera coordinates system.

43
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,140
As if the image was taken so that zero, zero was right in the middle.

44
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,610
But of course, we don't have any guarantee of this, right?

45
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,430
The image may have been cropped out of a a section of the window.

46
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,140
Or the, the location of the image actual sensor might need,

47
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,490
might not be lined up with the optical axis of the camera.

48
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:36,070
So we have two offsets, a u and a v offset, u0, v0.

49
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,820
So now we're up to one, two, three, four degrees of freedom.

50
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,180
Two scale factors and two offsets.

51
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,210
Are we done yet?

52
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,070
But wait, there's more.

53
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,570
Here comes the really ugly one.

54
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,450
We're assuming that the u direction and

55
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,340
the v direction are actually perpendicular.

56
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,070
What if there's actually a little bit of a skew?

57
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,200
So u and v went out drinking one night, and

58
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,000
they came back just off a little bit, all right?

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,190
So that's what's shown in this figure here.

60
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,590
The idea is that the ideal u and v are this way, okay?

61
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,890
But maybe the sensors actually sampled that way and that way.

62
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,010
That is, that the, the actual sampling of u,

63
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:24,800
v is not perpen, are not perpendicular, and they're off by some angle theta.

64
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,850
So that's what these equations are showing you here.

65
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,230
They're showing you the relationship between the v-prime which is measured and

66
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,740
the actual v, the u-prime and the actual u.

67
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:41,420
And so, when you substitute those into those equations we just had,

68
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,800
you get this sort of ugliness, okay?

69
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,150
So this is the really ugly extrins, sorry, intrinsic parameter representation.

70
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,030
And now we have, how many?

71
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,990
Well we've got an alpha and a beta, the two scale factors.

72
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,300
That's two degrees of freedom.

73
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,710
A u0 and v0 for the two offsets.

74
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,450
Plus theta, which is the skew
