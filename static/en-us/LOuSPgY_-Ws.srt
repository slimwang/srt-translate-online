00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,352
This last choice is correct. There's no value of x that lets 10 to the x equal

2
00:00:05,352 --> 00:00:11,436
0. So that means 0 is not in the range of f of x equals 10 to the x. Since log

3
00:00:11,436 --> 00:00:15,979
base 10 of x is the inverse of this function f, it can't be in the domain of

4
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:23,396
log base 10 of x. That means that we can't find log base 10 of 0. This value is

5
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:24,787
just undefined.
