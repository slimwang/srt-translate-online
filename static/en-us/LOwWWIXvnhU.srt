1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,453
Again, we have to find the z scores for each of these. The z score slightly

2
00:00:04,453 --> 00:00:09,974
changes because our sample size is now 50 instead of 30. Now our z score here

3
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:16,768
becomes about 0.97, which is still outside the critical region. But the z score

4
00:00:16,768 --> 00:00:23,380
for our sample mean is as high as 2.44, approximately. And that's in our

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,720
critical region. In this case, based on the results of our sample, we would

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,236
reject the null. However, we're pretending that the new population parameter

7
00:00:33,236 --> 00:00:39,456
will be outside the critical region, close to the old population parameter. In

8
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:43,791
this case, we would reject the null, when the null is actually true. Then we're

9
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:48,395
committing a Type I error. In this case, it just so happened that we randomly

10
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:54,110
selected a sample of students who were already really engaged. After all, that

11
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:59,720
is possible. There's a 2.5% chance that we get a mean with a z score greater

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,400
that 1.96.
