1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,840
So we know that the Phrases
activity screen broke

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,150
with the most recent code changes.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,150
So let's go back and
review what we just did.

4
00:00:09,336 --> 00:00:11,250
In the WordAdapter class,

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,550
we added this block of code to display
the correct image in a list item.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,410
So it's probably acting weird when we
called the setImageResource because

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,660
phrases don't have an image.

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,200
So here's the answer
to the first question.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,392
The problem with the Phrases activity
is that the screen is blank.

10
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:33,320
The WordAdapter assumes that
the word has an image, but

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,470
phrases don't have images.

12
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,000
So, moving on to the second question.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,150
There are several possible
solutions on how we could describe

14
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,400
the way we should modify or
code to fix the problem.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,350
We could have written a specific adapter
called PhraseAdapter that would know

16
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,670
exactly how to create list item views
that contain just two text views and

17
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,110
no ImageView.

18
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,640
So the PhraseAdapter would have been
just used in the PhrasesActivity.

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,070
Whereas the WordAdapter could have been
used in the other three activities.

20
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,920
However, this solution involves a lot
of duplicate logic in both adapters.

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,390
We would have the same logic to handle
displaying both the English and

22
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,070
Miwok translations.

23
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,230
So, why don't we just stick with
the single WordAdapter class.

24
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,460
So we can modify the WordAdapter
class just slightly so

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,590
they can create list items both
without an image and with an image.

26
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,010
And then we can use the single
adapter in all other activities.

27
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,870
So you'll notice that the
PhrasesActivity has the same layout for

28
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,580
list items as the other
three activities,

29
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,980
except that there's no ImageView.

30
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,240
So the text just shifts
slightly over to the left.

31
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,690
I also gave you a hint in the quiz
that said that you can hide or

32
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,100
show a view in Android
while the app is running.

33
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,180
So knowing that, does that mean that we
can show an ImageView in a list item in

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,270
some cases, and
hide the ImageView in other cases?

35
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,220
Here I am in Android for

36
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,000
All documentation looking
at the if/else statements.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,940
Now, if you remember from lesson
three in the last course,

38
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,570
we learned that our code can
behave in different ways

39
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,130
using something called
control flow statements.

40
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,919
This means that we can go
down different paths of code,

41
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,180
depicted here as the train tracks,
based on certain test conditions, so

42
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,300
depicted here as the switches.

43
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,100
Now for the number, family and
color words, we can go down one path.

44
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,010
But for the phrases,
we can go down another path.

45
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,750
More specifically, how does that
translate to our code or for

46
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,020
the number family and color words?

47
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,650
We want to execute this block
of code that's used for

48
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,930
setting the correct
image on an ImageView.

49
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,190
But for phrases, we want to go ahead and
just skip this logic and

50
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,600
instead hide the ImageView so
it doesn't show anything at all.

51
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,520
So let's write that answer into
the second question on our quiz.

52
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,430
So asked to describe how to modify
our code to fix this problem.

53
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,160
We can modify the WordAdapter so that we
only assign an image to the ImageView

54
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,840
for number, color, and family words.

55
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,150
But for
phrases we can just hide the ImageView.

56
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,720
Well, I don't know about you but I'm
not too happy with this answer just yet

57
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,560
it's still really hard
to translate into code.

58
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,210
We need to think more about how we can
determine which category a word is in.

59
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,090
Now, if we go ahead and

60
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,480
take a look at the word class, one way
to go about this is that we could add

61
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,770
a new variable that keeps track
of the category for each word.

62
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,109
But ultimately,
we just need to know whether or

63
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:23,868
not we should hide this ImageView.

64
00:03:23,868 --> 00:03:27,004
Now, remember in the word class
we already have a field for

65
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:28,285
the image resource ID.

66
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:30,435
And when I say field,
that's just another word for

67
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:32,470
global variable of a class.

68
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,420
So in order to determine whether we
should hide or show the ImageView in

69
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,985
a list item, we can check whether or not
the constructor has set this ImageView.

70
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,090
So I'm going to go back and
update my answer to this quiz question.

71
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,960
So instead,
we can modify the WordAdapter so

72
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,160
we use and if/else statement.

73
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,190
If there is an image associated with
the word object, show the ImageView.

74
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,510
Otherwise, hide the ImageView.

75
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,120
And there we go.
That's a lot more helpful

76
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,020
when we need to write
the code to make this change.

77
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,622
So the previous answer
was just too vague.

78
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:06,170
All right, so knowing this,
let's move on to the next step now.
