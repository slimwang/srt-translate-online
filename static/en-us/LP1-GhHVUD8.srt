00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,190
Sometimes we can't hide the implementation of a design decision

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,100
inside a single method or class.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,130
It's just too big.

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,580
Martin's Common Closure Principle says that regardless of

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,170
the level of granularity that we are forced to use,

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,300
we should group the related elements into a common release unit.

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,310
In Java, this would typically be a package.

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,110
Stated succinctly, this principle says that classes that change together,

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,100
should be released together.
