1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,490
Here's the movie manager.

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,330
Let's take a look at what it can do.

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,910
This first screen should look familiar.

4
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,980
It's like the login screen from last
lesson, however in this lesson we're

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,770
going to use a new auth flow
that's similar to OAuth.

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,945
OAuth's an authentication
standard that focuses on.

7
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:15,625
Our apps not having to collect
usernames and passwords.

8
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:18,453
And you can see here there's no
username or password field anymore.

9
00:00:18,453 --> 00:00:21,825
Using this off-flow is going to
be great exposure for us,

10
00:00:21,825 --> 00:00:23,025
because it's like OAuth.

11
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:26,190
And OAuth is so
commonly used by other APIs.

12
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,220
If we tap the button then this web use
display, and we can either allow or

13
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,970
deny the app access to our user data.

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,140
In some cases you may not see this
screen first because you have to log in

15
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,900
through the website so
you may be presented with a username and

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,870
a password except this
time it's in a web view.

17
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,970
In either case,
once we get here we'll tap allow so

18
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,830
that we can actually access the app.

19
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,710
Once we're in,
we have another tab view controller.

20
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,990
And you can see here at the bottom we
have a movies tab, a watchlist tab, and

21
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,705
a favorites tab.

22
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:57,255
On the movie tab, we can search for
movies by name so

23
00:00:57,255 --> 00:01:00,885
I'll start searching for one of my
favorite movies, the school of rock and

24
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:03,905
as I'm typing, you can see that
the table view updates automatically.

25
00:01:03,905 --> 00:01:04,735
This is really slick.

26
00:01:04,735 --> 00:01:07,845
And then when we tap it,
we're presented with this detail view.

27
00:01:07,845 --> 00:01:10,405
On the detail view you've
seen this button before,

28
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:12,035
this is the favorites button and

29
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:15,850
then this button here will allow you
to add the movie to your watch list.

30
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,370
So I'll go ahead and add school of rock
to my favorites and to my watch list.

31
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,660
And then rather intuitively I can
go back to the watch list tab and

32
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,190
school of rock's been
added here at the bottom.

33
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,440
And then if you look
at the favorites tab,

34
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,570
it's also been added to the bottom here.

35
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,490
And that's the app.

36
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,060
Let's go build it.
