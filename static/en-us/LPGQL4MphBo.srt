1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,870
Okay, let's suppose you live in
Seattle and you want to make an order.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,700
You look at the prices on your computer.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,650
You see what you think looks like
the prices are going to go up.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,010
So you enter a buy order.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,950
Now your order travels all
the way across the country.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,500
And because you use ETrade
it stops in Atlanta, and

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,260
then it hops to New York City.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,920
Let's now zoom in and

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,330
see what's happening at
the Exchange in New York City.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,040
So, we've zoomed into the New York Stock
Exchange, and the order book there is

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,310
visible to you over in Seattle, but
also to computers that are colocated.

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,810
So, let's suppose our hedge
fund has a colocated computer.

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,540
And it's observing
the order book as well.

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,770
Now here's the advantage that
this colocated hedge fund has.

15
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,579
It's computer is located maybe a 100
meters away from the main exchange

16
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:57,959
computer that holds the order book.

17
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:02,065
So that 100 meters amounts to 0.3
microseconds in terms of how long

18
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:07,440
it takes information about the order
book to reach that hedge fund computer.

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,163
You, on the other hand,
are located at least 2500 miles away.

20
00:01:12,163 --> 00:01:14,920
And that means when this
order book changes,

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,349
it takes 12 milliseconds at least for
that information to get to you and

22
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:23,360
12 milliseconds at least for
your order to reach the exchange.

23
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,340
So, here's how what I call
the order book exploit works.

24
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,950
The hedge fund is continually
observing the order book.

25
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,000
And remember, it takes only 0.3
microsceconds for it to do that.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,650
Based on what it sees at the order book,
it thinks the price is going to go up.

27
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,770
The hedge fund buys some of that
stock based on what it sees.

28
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,290
You're thinking the same thing,
so you've entered buy.

29
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,700
And your order starts making
its way across the country.

30
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,680
While your order is coming
across the country, indeed,

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,740
the price is going up, because other
orders are coming in from other places.

32
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,630
Eventually, your order makes it to
the New York Stock Exchange and

33
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,330
is executed there.

34
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,960
And, in fact,
the hedge fund sells it to you.

35
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,410
And over this few fractions of a second,

36
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,420
the hedge fund has bought some stock,
watched it go up and sold it.

37
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,550
It might have held this 100 shares of
stock for only a few milliseconds and

38
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,180
made a profit.

39
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,460
And the hedge fund is
exploiting essentially

40
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,080
all these people remotely located around
the country observing the order book,

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,240
essentially late sending in orders
that it can take advantage of because

42
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,330
it can act much earlier before those
orders from around the country arrive.

43
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,450
There's certainly many sorts of
ways to exploit market mechanics.

44
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,597
Here's one more.

45
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:47,650
I call this one the geographic
arbitrage exploit.

46
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,470
Suppose we have exchanges
located some distance away and

47
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,500
because they're located distantly prices
may drift a little bit up or down.

48
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,370
Now a hedge fund might place their own
servers at each of these Exchanges and

49
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,170
connect them with an ultra high
speed dedicated connection.

50
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,460
And they're observing the order book,

51
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,130
the prices at both these locations
all the time and comparing notes.

52
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,680
Let's suppose a difference
emerges that in New York

53
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,760
the price is a little bit lower,
in London price is a little bit higher.

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,750
The fund will immediately buy
in New York, and sell in London.

55
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,890
They're not necessarily even
transferring those same shares.

56
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,960
They might buy some set of
shares in New York City, and

57
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,110
sell a different set in London.

58
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,460
But they're getting that difference
in price advantage immediately.

59
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:46,450
Now, because hedge funds do this,
because they're monitoring the prices

60
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,610
that exchanges all over the world, these
sorts of differences rarely arise and

61
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:55,250
when they do it's just
by fractions of a cent.

62
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,530
But those differences do arise because
there are inefficiencies in the markets

63
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:05,640
and there are hedge funds there to
pick those pennies up off the ground.

64
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,020
Again, this is geographic arbitrage.
