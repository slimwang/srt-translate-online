1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,280
Here we are back in
the Firebase console.

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,109
I'm currently in the Auth tab,
and let's see what it shows us.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,710
I'm going to click the button,
set up sign in methods, so

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,118
you can see the different authentication
methods that Firebase provides.

5
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:16,679
As we can see,
Firebase provides that backbone for

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:17,981
several ways to authenticate.

7
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:20,780
For FriendlyChat, we'll enable email and

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,720
password authentication,
and Google Authentication.

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:25,509
Make sure to click save.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,070
And now users can authenticate
against the Firebase project

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,980
using an email address and
password, or with a Google account.

12
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:36,129
Let's move on to implementing
the client side code.
