1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,610
So I want to pass in a color
into the word adapter so

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,890
all the words in that category
have the same background color.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,227
So to do this I will need to modify
the word adapter to hold our color

4
00:00:10,227 --> 00:00:11,148
resource value.

5
00:00:11,148 --> 00:00:20,428
[BLANK_AUDIO]

6
00:00:20,428 --> 00:00:25,195
And now I'll need a modifier existing
constructor to accept this new

7
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:29,958
color resource ID as an input, and
now I need to set the value of m color

8
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:34,910
resource ID to be whatever input was
passed in as the color resource ID.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,620
And then at the bottom of the give
you method I need to set the color.

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,940
So that's done with this
block of code here.

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,870
So first I'm setting
the theme of the color for

12
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,930
the lists item and then I'm finding he
color that the resource ID maps to and

13
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,680
then finally set in the background
color of the text container view.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,280
I know colors can be a bit tricky and

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,420
it did take me a couple
tries to get this right.

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,640
But follow along and you'll be able to
do something similar in your own app.

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,620
So now, we need a convert the color
resource ID into a color value.

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,705
To do this, let's head on over
to the list item way out.

19
00:01:07,705 --> 00:01:11,430
In here we need to make sure that the
linear layout in the list item layout

20
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,510
has an ID on the container.

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,270
So back to the word adapter.

22
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,030
So now that we have the word adapter
constructor set up to take in the color

23
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,760
resource ID, we need to modify
the other activities so

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,990
that when we call the word
adopt a constructor.

25
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,020
We're passing the right inputs.

26
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,011
So we that here in the numbers activity.

27
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:30,999
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:36,307
I want to add that here in the colors
activity, and similarly for

29
00:01:36,307 --> 00:01:41,140
the phrases activity and
lastly for the family activity.

30
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,770
And one more thing before I forget.

31
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,212
So back on the list item layout,
remember to remove the background color

32
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:51,400
that we hard coded
into list item layout.

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,190
So we had set it to always appear as an
orange background color behind the text,

34
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,250
but now that we can set the color
dynamically when the list items created

35
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,050
we don't need it any more.

36
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,880
So let's test out the app now.

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,840
So let's start with numbers.

38
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,090
All right orange is expected and
then family members, whoa.

39
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,750
That looks really good.

40
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,130
So going back to the colors nice and

41
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,530
then lastly phrases
while liking that blue.

42
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,630
So each category shows a different color
as expected and it's all coming together

43
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,590
and looking really polished now,
so high five on that great job.
