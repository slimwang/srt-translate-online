1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,580
Now let me actually talk
a little bit about warping and

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,210
we are going to get into lot more
detail about this in the next lesson.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,880
So here basically,
I'm just showing you two images.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,570
Right, so I have a point here and I
want to generate a larger point which is

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,220
being rotated in the new word image
space where the domain is x prime,

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,570
y prime so this may coordinate xs, and
of course, I have my transformation.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,470
So I take this pixel and
I warp it to this location here.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,110
So in essence,

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,740
what we're doing is sending each pixel
from f(x,y) to its corresponding

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,330
location with a transformation
T(x,y) in the second image.

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,350
What happens if the new pixel
lands between two pixels?

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,050
Remember, this could be much bigger in
this open space that we coming up with.

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,670
In that sense,
we're taking a bigger image and

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,290
filling information from there.

15
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,690
In the forward mapping, what's really
done is that we would distribute

16
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,770
the color among the neighborhood pixels.

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,400
So, if this is the pixel I have there,
and it shows up there, I would kind of

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,730
distribute the color in the ones
around it to generate a new pixel.

19
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,150
And that's what I would actually do.

20
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,502
This is the forward warping process.

21
00:01:01,502 --> 00:01:05,410
Another well-known process is when we
actually go inwards, backward warping.

22
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,150
Again, I take a pixel from here,
and I want to go and

23
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,130
figure out the inverse transformation to
find where would it actually end up, and

24
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,260
what would I do with it.

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,880
So again in this, what I will do is take
each pixel from the warped image and

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,510
find its corresponding location, and

27
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,600
move it to a new image as
long as I know the inverse.

28
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,990
Again, in this case, what happens
if it shows up in between pixels?

29
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,580
In this case,

30
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,700
what we would do is basically we
will interpolate the color values.

31
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,030
Those where we were redistributing.

32
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,840
Here we would interpolate
the color values and

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,200
fill it in here from the neighbors.

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,990
Again, how do we do this interpolation?

35
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,120
Remember how we did things like
filtering images and stuff like that.

36
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,950
We could use those types of
methods to help us do this.

37
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,570
Just to do a quick comparison,
forward versus inverse warping.

38
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,200
Which one do you think is better?

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,530
Well usually,
inverse mapping is a better map that,

40
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,210
because it eliminates holes.

41
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,330
We're always going from
something we know how to get to,

42
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,110
to much more of an original image.

43
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,660
And of course that allows us to
fill in all the color information.

44
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,910
If you sometimes go from one to the
other, we might run into places where we

45
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,919
don't have,
we'll have to do some sort of hole fill.

46
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,880
I'll talk a little a bit about
that when we talk about morphing.

47
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,350
But, the important part
is to do inverse warping,

48
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,430
we need an invertible warp function.

49
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,860
Now I want you all to think about how
we would actually create an invertible

50
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,670
warp function based on what
we've talked about before.

51
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,360
And see that in some instances,
especially for rigid warps and

52
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,320
stuff like that, that's the easily
computable inverse functions.

53
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,360
Especially when you have rotations and
translations and you're doing scales.

54
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,470
It does get harder when you do
a bunch of other things and

55
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,740
not all the time especially when
you do have, not a global warp.

56
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,380
It gets harder and
harder to compute those.
