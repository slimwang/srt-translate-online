1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So as my last exercise for you, I want you to program the standard deviation.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I won't say much other than you might want to use the function "sqrt"

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
that returns the square root of its argument.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So here's the coding environment.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm actually importing the function sqrt for you from the math library.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Otherwise it doesn't work.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Data structure. Mean.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Our compact version of variance,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and I want you to program standard deviation

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
so that when you hit "stddev" for data2,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
you get 7.9103 and so on for the data set I'm giving you.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So just enter the right thing at standard deviation.
