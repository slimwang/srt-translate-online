Okay, so this is the quiz. Assume that you

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:05,170
have two coins, A and B. Both are fair coins,

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,700
and you flip both A and B. We will assume

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,210
in this case that A gives us no information about

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,690
B, which is how it works in the real

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,440
world. So the probability of A and B is 0.5.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,730
Try to find out the joint probability of AB, conditional

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,260
probability of A given B. The entropy of A, B,

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,040
and the joined entropy, the condition

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,590
entropy and imaging information. 'Kay, refer to

11
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,650
the nodes or formulas from previous videos and try to answer these questions.
