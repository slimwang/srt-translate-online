1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,279
looking at a grayscale image i see

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:04,559
breakpoints dark points and all the gray

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:06,899
in between rapid changes in brightness

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,750
are where we find the edges are image is

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,400
just a mathematical function of x and y

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,808
so we can perform mathematical

7
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:14,400
operations on it just like any other

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,070
function for example we can take its

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,050
derivative which is just a measure of

10
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,359
change of this function a small

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,278
derivative means small change derivative

12
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,129
big change images are two-dimensional so

13
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:27,239
it makes sense to take the derivative

14
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:29,579
with respect to X & Y simultaneously

15
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,279
this is called the gradient and in

16
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,270
computing it

17
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,308
we're measuring how fast pixel values

18
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:37,079
are changing at each point in an image

19
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,179
and in which direction they're changing

20
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:41,670
most rapidly computing the gradient

21
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,950
gives us thick edges with the candy

22
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,170
algorithm we will thin out these edges

23
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,149
to find just the individual pixels that

24
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,729
follow the strongest gradients well then

25
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:52,500
extend those strong edges to include

26
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,969
pixels all the way down to a lower

27
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,070
threshold that we defined when calling

28
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,759
the candy function
