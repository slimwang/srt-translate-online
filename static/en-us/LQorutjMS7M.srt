00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,823
Anxiety can actually be beneficial in some situations. For example, let's say

2
00:00:04,823 --> 00:00:07,925
you're anxious about studying for your final, well that anxiety can jump start

3
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:10,745
you to actually start studying for the final in an effort to relieve your

4
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:16,750
anxiety. However, for some people, anxiety can become excessive, which can lead

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,272
to a anxiety disorder. Now, there are a number of these types of disorders,

6
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:24,728
from generalized anxiety disorder to post traumatic stress syndrome, even

7
00:00:24,728 --> 00:00:30,458
social anxiety disorder. In fact, obsessive compulsive disorder used to be

8
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:35,167
listed in the DSM as an anxiety disorder. However, in the newest version of the

9
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:40,150
DSM, it now has its own chapter. Research looking at the cause of anxiety

10
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:45,205
disorders, looks at both genetic and environmental factors. As with many other

11
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:48,809
topics, psychologists use twin studies to determine what's a genetic cause, and

12
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,260
what's an environmental cause. And using a variety of techniques, researchers

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,920
have found the amygdala, and hippocampus, play an important role in most

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,200
anxiety disorders.
