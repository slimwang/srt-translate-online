1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,710
So, Katherine, we've been working
on this course for a while.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:03,560
>> I know, Kunal.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,270
And it's about to launch so
I'm really excited.

4
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:05,780
>> Right.

5
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,279
It's been a couple of months that
we've been designing this course, and

6
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:09,546
I want to be in perfect synch with you.

7
00:00:09,546 --> 00:00:10,440
>> Okay.

8
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,680
>> Around who the learner or
the student of this course is.

9
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,880
>> Yeah.
So I think

10
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,220
the learner is someone who's
never programmed before.

11
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:17,980
>> Wait.

12
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,860
When you say never,
you mean no lines of code.

13
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,520
>> Zero.

14
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,510
>> Zero lines of code.

15
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,613
>> Yeah.
>> Wow that's going to

16
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:26,483
be a tough course for us to design but
it's going to open up the gambit for

17
00:00:26,483 --> 00:00:27,833
everybody to take this course.

18
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:28,448
>> Absolutely.

19
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:30,210
I think that's why it's so powerful.

20
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,800
because at the end of this course,

21
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,170
I think they should be able to build
a couple of simple Android apps.

22
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,440
>> Wait, let's backtrack a little bit.

23
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,370
So, we're saying no lines of code,
no programming experience but

24
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,050
we're still saying you need a computer
and you need an internet connection.

25
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,670
>> Yeah, and to have some familiarity
with using a computer and a smart phone.

26
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,610
>> So you browse the internet let's
say on a smartphone or a computer?

27
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,270
>> Yeah.

28
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,020
>> Okay, well let's say this is where
the student is right now, right?

29
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,624
And this is where a professional
Android developer is, right?

30
00:00:55,624 --> 00:00:56,808
This is where they're making apps,

31
00:00:56,808 --> 00:00:59,220
they're making money,
they're changing the world.

32
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,160
Let's say this is where we will
get them at the end of our course.

33
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,550
>> I think we can get them to here.

34
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,300
>> Okay, so in this journey that
the student is taking with us,

35
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,440
what sort of apps
are they building here?

36
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,850
>> Yeah, so
the first app is a birthday card app.

37
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,130
>> Wait, you said first app,
so there is more than one app?

38
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,292
>> Yeah, so first there's a birthday
card app, where they can make it for

39
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:19,408
someone that they love.

40
00:01:19,408 --> 00:01:20,128
>> I like that.

41
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,260
People have birthdays.

42
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,683
Sometimes they even have half birthdays.

43
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:23,924
[LAUGH]
>> Yeah, and

44
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:27,110
the second app should be
a coffee ordering app.

45
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,430
>> So you say, I want two cappuccinos,

46
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,110
and two cappuccinos appear
magically from the phone?

47
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:33,980
>> Not quite.

48
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,580
But it captures what
the user wants to order and

49
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,150
then it sends it off in an email.

50
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,810
>> Okay.

51
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,005
So in this journey that we've been
sort of dreaming up, how long will it

52
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:45,852
take the student so they can
budget their time appropriately?

53
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:48,630
>> Hopefully, 20, 25 hours.

54
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,720
>> I think that's about right.

55
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,940
It'll take a lot of deliberate practice.

56
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,580
They'll make a couple of fun apps.

57
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,910
But what they can do is they
can take this 25 hours and

58
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,260
split this up into 4 or
5 weeks worth of their time.

59
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,330
>> Yeah, I think that sounds good.

60
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,200
>> So that's as much about
the course and about us.

61
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,060
At this point,
I want to ask our students a question.
