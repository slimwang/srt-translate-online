1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] As usual, we can resolve this using Bayes' rule.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Probability of Perfect Storm given movie times P of movie

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
divided by the same expression plus this expression for the opposite class, song.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here I simply write 3 dots for the text Perfect Storm.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Plugging in the values over here and assuming conditional independence,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
as is the case when I use Bayes, we get the probably of "perfect" given movie,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
which is 3/19 and "storm" given movie, 1/19, times the prior over half,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and we divide this by the same number plus probability of "perfect" given song,

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
which is 2/19, and the probability of "storm" given song, which is 2/19 times the prior of half.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, all the enumerators fall out, and we get 3 over 3 plus 2, which is 3 over 7.
