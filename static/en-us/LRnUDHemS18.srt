00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,486
The square root of 98 equals 7 root 2, the square root of 150 equal 5 root 6.

2
00:00:06,486 --> 00:00:10,200
And the square root of 72 equals 6 root 2. Great work if you got each of these

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,459
correct. You're really mastering your square roots. We can split up 98 into 2

4
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:19,161
times 49 and then take the square root of 49 which equals 7. The 2 states

5
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:23,995
inside of the radical are the square root. Because we can't simplify it. We use

6
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:29,640
a similar approach for the square root of 150. We rewrite 150 as 25 times 6.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,855
And take the square root of 25 to get 5 root 6. And finally, for the square

8
00:00:34,855 --> 00:00:40,400
root of 72, we rewrite 72 as 36 times 2. And then take the square root of 36.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,736
Which leaves us with 6 times the square root of 2 or 6 root 2. I hope you're

10
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:49,700
starting to see some patterns with square roots. And, if anything, you can

11
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,582
always start simplifying these even numbers by dividing by 2. I've shown you

12
00:00:52,582 --> 00:00:54,778
the quickest way to get to the final answers but there are, of course, some

13
00:00:54,778 --> 00:00:58,580
other ways you could have gotten there as well. Be sure to compare your work to

14
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,933
these answers to see if you could have gotten to the answer more quickly.
