Awesome work if you got this one right. First we distribute a negative 1 to each

2
00:00:04,465 --> 00:00:08,957
of the terms, so we change the signs. Next we combine our like terms and regroup

3
00:00:08,957 --> 00:00:13,720
them in our next line. 6a to the 4th, and 6a to the fourth make 12a to the 4th.

4
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:17,832
A squared and a cubed just need to be listed down here. Notice that I switched

5
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:21,782
the order of them, that's okay. I know 2 plus 1 is the same thing as 1 plus 2.

6
00:00:21,782 --> 00:00:25,947
We can use the commutative property of addition to rewrite our expressions. The

7
00:00:25,947 --> 00:00:29,906
order doesn't matter. And finally on the end, we have negative 2. If you're

8
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:33,874
wondering why I switched the order of these, it's because we usually have the

9
00:00:33,874 --> 00:00:38,548
powers decrease as we list the terms. We have a to the fourth, a to the cubed, a

10
00:00:38,548 --> 00:00:42,972
squared, there's no a term here and then our constant. If you're having any

11
00:00:42,972 --> 00:00:47,327
trouble with adding or subtracting polynomials, that's a great time to ask some

12
00:00:47,327 --> 00:00:51,657
questions in the forum. We love to hear from you. Maybe you're wondering about

13
00:00:51,657 --> 00:00:55,790
like terms, or maybe you're wondering about intergers. If so, let us know.
