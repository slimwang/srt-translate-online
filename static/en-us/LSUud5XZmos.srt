00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,969
Let's look at the answer for
our way prediction quiz.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:08,760
We can use way prediction in any cache
that has more than one block in a set.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,820
A direct-mapped cache has
only one block in a set.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,498
So we can not use way prediction.

5
00:00:14,498 --> 00:00:19,115
Basically, a direct-map cache
already knows which one blocked to

6
00:00:19,115 --> 00:00:21,398
access without having to guess.

7
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:22,970
In any set-associative, or

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,650
fully associated cache,
we can benefit from way prediction.

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,880
For example for
a twoway set-associative cache,

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,290
we can guess which on of the two
is more likely to have the block.

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,090
In an eight-way set-associative cache,
we're guessing which one of the eight.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,960
And in a fully associative cache,
we are guessing

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,710
which block in the whole cache is
the most likely to have the block.

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,560
So the correct answer is,
that these should be selected, and

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,560
this one should not.
