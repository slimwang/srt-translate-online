00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,457
So, how do we see anything? Well, clearly, we use our eyes. But lets talk a bit

2
00:00:04,457 --> 00:00:08,756
more about that. Light travels through the pupil, through the eyes interior. It

3
00:00:08,756 --> 00:00:12,987
makes contact with the retina in the rear which is covered with rods and cones.

4
00:00:12,988 --> 00:00:16,347
The rods are for low level lighting, such as during night time, and also for

5
00:00:16,347 --> 00:00:20,300
peripheral vision and motion detection. The cones provide us with core vision.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,716
The key idea here is, light coming from a particular direction is detected by

7
00:00:24,716 --> 00:00:28,864
cones in a particular spot in the eye. This description barely touches on the

8
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:33,168
complexity of the eye. The iris around the pupil opens and closes to let more or

9
00:00:33,168 --> 00:00:37,421
less light in. The back of the eye is a curved surface. The density of cones is

10
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:41,497
highest tin the fovea. Which is where our eyes focus for reading or other

11
00:00:41,497 --> 00:00:44,600
activities. And we haven't even touched on what happens to these signals when

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,883
they're processed by the brain.
