1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,859
Once you've initialized your array,

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:04,939
chances are you're going to
want to add or remove items.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,370
To add an item to the end of an array,
I can use the append method like this.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,460
Or to add an item to
a specific place in an array,

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,670
I can use the method, insert at index.

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,090
To remove an item,
you use the method, remove it index.

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:19,980
So for example,

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,120
to take out Flo Rida, we need to
specify that he's at index three.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,621
But I don't think this playlist
has enough country music, so

10
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:31,201
we'll insert Keith Urban, and
we'll put him at index three.

11
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:35,446
And then if we look over
here in our sidebar,

12
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:38,070
we can see that Keith Urban
has been added to the array.

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,040
If I want to know how many items are in
my array, I can use the count method.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,280
If I want to retrieve an item,
I can do so using sub script syntax.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,850
I just write the name of the array, and

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,300
at the end, add the items index as
a sub script between square brackets.

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,815
And here in the sidebar we can see that
the value Dej Loaf has been assigned to

18
00:00:57,815 --> 00:00:59,915
the constant musician.

19
00:00:59,915 --> 00:01:03,475
We've written exercises to give you
plenty of practice working with arrays.

20
00:01:03,475 --> 00:01:06,105
I think you'll find the syntax
to be fairly intuitive.

21
00:01:06,105 --> 00:01:08,955
For now, let's continue on to
dictionaries in the next section.
