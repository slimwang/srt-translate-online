00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,455
So whenever we see absolute value bars, we want to think distance. Let's see if

2
00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:08,786
we can use that knowledge to answer this question. So what do you think? What

3
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:13,155
could the values of K be? 0? Negative 3 and 3? Any real number? Or no solution?

4
00:00:13,254 --> 00:00:17,573
Take some time to think about it and draw some diagrams. Maybe try and place K

5
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:19,670
at different parts of the number line.
