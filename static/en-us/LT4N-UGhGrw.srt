1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In this problem we're going to look at the naive multiplication algorithm from lecture.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's say we're computing naive( 63, 12).

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
At some point in the executionâso we'll pause hereâ

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
we'll have x = 20 and y = 12.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The question is, what is z?
