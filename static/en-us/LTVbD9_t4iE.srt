00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:06,640
DSM is providing the application developer with a programming model

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,490
on a cluster that is akin to P threads on an SMP. It looks and feels like a

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,840
shared memory threads package. That's good. But

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,620
what about performance? Will the performance of

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,930
a multi-threaded app. Scale up as we

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,850
increase the number of processors in the cluster.

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,680
Now, from an application programmer's point of view, your

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,930
expectation is that, as you add more processors, you're

9
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,390
going to get more performance. That's your expectation. And what

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,990
we are doing is, we're exploiting the parallelism that is

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,226
available both in the application because it's structured in

12
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:44,960
that way. And in the hardware, in order to get

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,670
increase performances as you increase the number of processors.

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,880
But the problem is as you increase the number of

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,870
processors because things are happening in software, there

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,570
is increased overhead as well. And this overhead

17
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,600
increases as the number of processors, so the

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,150
actual performance is going to be actually much

19
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,800
less than your expectation. Mitigated by the increasing

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,580
overhead with the number of processors. And this

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,570
buildup of overhead with a number of processes,

22
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,900
happens in a true memory multi-processors. And this

23
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,690
is even more true in the case of liason. Which

24
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:25,220
is implementing the shared memory extraction in software on a cluster.
