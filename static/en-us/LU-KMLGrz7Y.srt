00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,843
Now that we've figured out the horizontal position of the maximum value of the

2
00:00:03,843 --> 00:00:07,678
function, in this interval at least, I'd like you to find that maximum value of

3
00:00:07,678 --> 00:00:12,928
the function that we're looking for. So, find the y coordinate or the f of x

4
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:23,708
coordinate of this peak point. Is it about 0, 2.5, 10.243, 15.02, 25.6 or 13.67.
