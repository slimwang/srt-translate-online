00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,794
First, to keep track of its position in the world, that's correct. All of our

2
00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:06,112
entities in grids, need to know what position in the world they're at for a

3
00:00:06,112 --> 00:00:09,976
number of reasons, like physics, collision and rendering. What about this, to

4
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:14,450
know when it's time to die? this is actually not required. Not all entities

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,930
have a concept of time, nor have a concept of death. For instance, landmine

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,866
entities only live on the map for about 30 seconds. As such, they need to know

7
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:26,694
how long they're staying around in life before they explode. Other entities

8
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:30,580
like these spawners, which will actually generate energy canisters and health

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,214
canisters, never die. So they have no concept of life or death. They stick

10
00:00:35,214 --> 00:00:38,630
around until the map is unloaded. What about this one? To think or be able to

11
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:43,310
do something each tick? This one is definitely a requirement. The definition as

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,334
an entity as we've discussed before, is that you have a class which contains

13
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:49,454
some unique logic, that makes this entity different from all the other ones in

14
00:00:49,454 --> 00:00:55,060
the world. The ability to think or have custom processing associated with an

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:00,243
entity, is critical to its definition. How about knowing what sounds to play?

16
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:04,522
this is a little vague. Some entities will need the ability to know, and play

17
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:08,588
sounds during events. For instance, when a rocket hits the wall, we would hope

18
00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:09,932
that it plays its explosion sound

19
00:01:09,932 --> 00:01:11,153
[SOUND].

20
00:01:11,153 --> 00:01:13,832
The player for instance, may not need to know any sounds, because the

21
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:17,653
environment is making sounds on their behalf. And finally, what about the need

22
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:21,664
to post to your Google Plus Stream? this is more of wishful thinking on my

23
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,979
part, but in reality you shouldn't be coding in the ability to do HTTP requests

24
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:30,182
to each one of the entities in your game. Although, you should definitely check

25
00:01:30,182 --> 00:01:31,880
out this place, I hear it's cool.
