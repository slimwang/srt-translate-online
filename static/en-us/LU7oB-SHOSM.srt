I should say this is not an easy question. Any answer is positive.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If you look at whatever the data was, this is roughly how this line looks like,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and that means in the data, there is a tendency as you increase x

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
there would be an increase of y, so that means the correlation will be positive.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We can't tell what value it is. If the data fits exactly onto the line, then it would be one.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It could also be that the data has enormous deviation from this line,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and this is the best fitting line, in which case

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the correlation coefficient will be still larger than zero but it might be much closer to zero,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
depending on the amount of deviation of those points from the line.
