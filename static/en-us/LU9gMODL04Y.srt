1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer, again, for joining variables is determined by pointwise multiplication,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
so we have 0.17 times 0.3 is 0.051,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
+t and +l, 0.17 times 0.7 is 0.119.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then we go to the minuses.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Minus 0.83 times 0.1 is 0.083.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And finally, 0.83 times 0.9 is 0.747.
