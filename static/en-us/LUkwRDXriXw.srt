00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The next question is how well does this is actually work

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
for providing our goal of authenticating the server to the client

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
in cases where the client does not know this public key value before the protocol.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We note that in this step the server sends the public key to the client,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and that's the key that is used to verify the signature.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Here are the possible answers. Think about what we will actually get from this protocol.
