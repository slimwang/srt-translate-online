00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,230
Now, fair game play has always been a requirement of multi-player games.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,188
Although, it didn't always start that way. See back in the early 90s, video

3
00:00:07,188 --> 00:00:10,068
game players were actual able to tweak some of their perimeters to get an

4
00:00:10,068 --> 00:00:14,093
unfair advantage. Quake players, for example, would actually lower their

5
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:17,041
resolution on the graphics card to lowest quality setting, reducing the amount

6
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,769
of processing time required to process a frame, so they would actually get

7
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:25,170
higher frame rates. Another good example, that I'm not really, you know, bitter

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,022
about, or anything, was my Quake clan actually lost the last round of a very

9
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:31,058
expensive tournament because all of us were on dial-up while the other team was

10
00:00:31,058 --> 00:00:36,450
all on DSL. Again, this was back before cable modems, again, not that I'm

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,917
bitter about that. The point is, that unfair game-play makes it bad for

12
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:44,898
everyone and then makes bitter people get bald. Since then, multi-player games

13
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:47,758
have actually done a lot to reduce this kind of cheating and unfair advantage,

14
00:00:47,758 --> 00:00:52,004
but it is something that we had to worry about Inside of GRITS. See, if you're

15
00:00:52,004 --> 00:00:54,734
actually using mouse controls, you have a lot more degrees of freedom because

16
00:00:54,734 --> 00:00:57,170
there is more resolution to it than someone who is playing on a four pad

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,818
keyboard. We decided to actually attack this for GRITS because some of us were

18
00:01:01,818 --> 00:01:04,527
bitter about losing unfair games in the past, and actually lock the mouse to

19
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:08,831
the same directional output that you get from a keyboard. Ensuring that both

20
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:11,954
players actually have a same and fair chance to play. Now, your designers

21
00:01:11,954 --> 00:01:14,642
should mostly take care of this, but if you're one of those types that likes to

22
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:17,372
design and program make sure you start from the beginning worrying about fair

23
00:01:17,372 --> 00:01:21,470
game play. Or you can create someone like this.
