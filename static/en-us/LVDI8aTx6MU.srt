00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,980
Here's our quadratic formula written out once again, and I've written the

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,052
discriminant b squared minus 4ac in teal. It's important to note that we're

3
00:00:08,052 --> 00:00:12,148
taking the square root of this number, and as we've said many times before, we

4
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:16,500
only know how to take the square root of non-negative numbers, non-negative real

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,062
numbers to be exact. So if we have a negative number under here, we're not going

6
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:25,299
to get any real solutions. However, we need to make another distinction among

7
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:29,400
the numbers that do give us real solutions. If we have a 0 under here, then we

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,366
only get 1 real solution. Since we'll have negative b plus or minus 0, and

9
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:37,721
either adding or subtracting zero from negative b gives us the same number, just

10
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:42,176
negative b. So we would just get negative b over 2a. If the discriminant is 0.

11
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:46,333
That's only 1 answer. This is only 1 number. It's our plus or minus, which is

12
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:50,687
what split this into 2 solutions originally, is no longer doing that for us. If

13
00:00:50,687 --> 00:00:54,587
b squared minus 4ac is positive, then we'll get some real number here and

14
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:59,066
negative b plus that number will be different from negative b minus that number.

15
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:03,288
So in that case we will wind up with 2 roots, two positions where we know that

16
00:01:03,288 --> 00:01:04,998
our parabola hits the x axis.
