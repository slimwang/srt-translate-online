00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,960
When you change the DIV tag to an H1 tag, the text should have changed in size,

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,000
and also the box around the text should have changed.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,050
Looking at this in the browser, when we change this DIV tag to H1,

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:22,410
save the file, and refresh our browser, we see that the text got bigger,

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,750
and we also have extra space above and below the text.

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,690
We can verify this in Developer tools by mousing over H1,

7
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:37,280
and you'll see that we have a rectangle around the My App title.
