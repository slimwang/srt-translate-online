1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,734
All right.

2
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:01,730
Welcome everybody.

3
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,090
Hope you're having a great day.

4
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,550
Back to computer vision and
were continuing with our work and

5
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,280
particle filters.

6
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,410
Last time we introduced
particle filtering and

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,360
we talked about the algorithm
that actually implemented it.

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,030
So were using a set of
particles representing density.

9
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,210
And we went through the base loop of
essentially propagating the belief

10
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,160
forward through about the deterministic
and non-deterministic part.

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,390
Then we get a measurement
which gives us a likelihood.

12
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,590
We multiply the,
the prediction by that likelihood and

13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,800
that gives us something in Bay's rule
that we can normalize to have a new

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,540
belief, a new posterior
estimate of the state.

15
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:43,870
So, in this lesson, we're going to look
at some, robot vision examples that,

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,600
sort of illustrate nicely, sort of,
the simplicity of using this method.
