1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's practice a bit more with regular expressions.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm going to write out a bunch of strings, and I want you to check all of them--

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
there may be multiple--that exactly match 0 through 9, the regular expression.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Down here I've written seven strings.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,950
Check each one that matches the regular expression 0 through 9.
