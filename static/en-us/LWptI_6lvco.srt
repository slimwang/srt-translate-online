00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,540
In addition to [UNKNOWN] mehta talks about, meta at all talks about services.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:12,210
Now these are not, services in the sense of services that the, user sees or

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:19,370
even service in the sense of client server. Okay that words,

4
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:24,060
it's a unit of computational service. These are services that connect or

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,880
provides the overall architecture. According to Mehta, it's a service

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,770
category that represents the broad interaction role the connector fulfills, and

7
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,840
they lay out four different categories of services including Communication.

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,650
That is the transmittal of data. Coordination which is the trans,

9
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,990
transfer of control. Conversion that's when some kind of a translation is

10
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,729
going on, particularly among data formats. Okay? And

11
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:55,120
Facilitation that is some kind of mediation or operation optimization activity.

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,080
And they use the abbreviations, T,O,X and F respectively on,

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,489
in their diagrams to abbreviate those particular four categories of services.
