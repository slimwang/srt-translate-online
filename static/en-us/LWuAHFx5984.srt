1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,390
In the previous examples we looked
at systems of equations that had

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,710
a unique solution.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,020
However, as we've seen,

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:10,070
it's not always the case that there
is a unique solution to every system.

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,270
We need the Gaussian elimination
procedure to be robust against these

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,270
cases.

7
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,661
Let's look at the following system.

8
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:20,964
x + 2y + 3z = 1, 3x + 2y +

9
00:00:20,964 --> 00:00:26,080
z = 0, 7x + 6y + 5z = 2.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,160
We can start solving
the system as usual,

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,310
clearing the terms
beneath the top x term.

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:40,719
Subtract three times the first equation
from the second to get -4y- 8z = -3.

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,567
And then subtract seven
times the first equation

14
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:50,188
from the third, to get -8y- 16z = -5.

15
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:53,301
Then we drop down to
the second equation and

16
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:56,380
start to clear the y terms beneath -4y.

17
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,004
Subtract two times the second
equation from the third, and

18
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:02,770
now we're in a very
interesting situation.

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,981
There is nothing remaining on the left
hand side of the third equation, but

20
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:13,550
there is a one remaining on the right
hand side, giving us the equation 0 = 1.

21
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,320
What does this mean?

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,102
Well, the original system of equations
assumes that there are numbers x,

23
00:01:20,102 --> 00:01:24,110
y, and z,
which satisfy the three simultaneously.

24
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,890
Since we used legal operations
on the original system and

25
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,840
obtained a false statement, it means
that these supposed numbers x, y,

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,630
and z, which satisfy the system,
must not exist.

27
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,850
In other words, this contradiction tells
us that the system is inconsistent.

28
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,480
It has no solutions.

29
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,260
In fact, if we ever run into the case
that the left hand side of an equation

30
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,540
is zero and the right hand side is
not zero, we can immediately stop and

31
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,240
say that the system has no solutions.

32
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,980
This is a nice criterion for
finding systems with no solutions.

33
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,730
But what about systems with
more than one solution?

34
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,180
This is a bit trickier.

35
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,343
Let's modify the system from
before just a little bit,

36
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:11,128
making the constant term in the third
equation one instead of two.

37
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:15,459
Again, we start by subtracting three
times the first equation from the second

38
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:19,673
and continue by subtracting seven times
the first equation from the third.

39
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:25,690
The third equation now reads,
-8y- 16z = -6.

40
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,980
Now as before, subtract two times
the second equation from the third,

41
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,420
unlike last time, the bottom
equation is not a contradiction.

42
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,740
Certainly zero equals zero.

43
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,270
So what are we to make of this?

44
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,790
Well since zero always equal zero,
regardless of what X, Y, and

45
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,110
Z are,
the last equation becomes redundant.

46
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,920
The system would have the exact same
solution if we dropped it all together.

47
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,870
This is how to interpret an equation
of the form zero equals zero,

48
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,360
the row it occupies was
originally a redundant equation.

49
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,300
It gives no extra information
about the solutions that was

50
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,680
not contained in the equations above it.

51
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,570
In fact, notice that in the original
system, if we added the first equation

52
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,720
to two times the second equation,
we would get the third equation.

53
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,180
So what do we do now?

54
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,180
The system essentially has
only two planes in it,

55
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,710
meaning that the solution
cannot be a single point,

56
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,440
since the planes aren't parallel, the
solution is that will be a line in fact.

57
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,060
Is there anything else we can do?

58
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,910
Yes, like we did with lines earlier,

59
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,760
we can parameterize the solution set,
in other words, we can describe

60
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,550
all the points in the solution set as
a function of some number of parameters.

61
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,980
How can we do this?

62
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,540
First after dropping the zero
equals zero equation,

63
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,820
notice that we cannot clear
terms downward anymore.

64
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,270
Instead what we will do is identify
what are called pivot variables.

65
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,880
These are variables whose values will
be determined by the values of the non

66
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,350
pivot or free variables.

67
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,900
The pivot variables are the variables
which are leading terms in our equations

68
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,750
in this case X and Y are leading terms.

69
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,680
So they are the pivot variables.

70
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,050
Since Z is not a leading term
in any of the equations,

71
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,870
it will be a free variable.

72
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,345
Since Z is a free variable,

73
00:04:10,345 --> 00:04:14,000
it will become a parameter in our
parametrization of the solution set.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,940
Now let's continue our Gaussian
elimination algorithm.

75
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,610
So we can end up with the
parametrization of the solution set of

76
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,519
our system.

77
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,910
In the second equation.

78
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,710
In order to make the pivot variable
have a coefficient equal one,

79
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,430
multiply through by negative one fourth.

80
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,040
The equation now reads y + 2z = 3/4.

81
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,690
Then like we normally do
in Gaussian elimination,

82
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,030
we will clear the terms
above the leading y term.

83
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,700
So we subtract two times the second
equation from the first.

84
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:48,290
This gives us x- z = -1/2
in the first equation.

85
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,090
Since the leading coefficient
of each equation is now one and

86
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,840
the leading variables only
appear in one equation each,

87
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,540
we have simplified the system
as much as possible.

88
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:04,030
This form is called reduced
row-echelon form, or rref for short.

89
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,430
We can now parametrize the solution
set in the following way.

90
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:12,280
Suppose xyz is a point in
the solution set, then x

91
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,850
will have to equal -1/2+z by
rearranging this top equation.

92
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:23,020
Similarly, by rearranging
the second equation we see that

93
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,410
y has to equal 3/4- 2z.

94
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,590
Finally since z is a free variable,
we set it equal to itself.

95
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,650
This means that for every real value of
z, this point is in the solution set.

96
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,250
Another way we can write this is
to split the vector into a sum

97
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,480
of a constant vector and
a vector with a z term.

98
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,230
This form should be familiar.

99
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,060
It is how we parameterized
the line previously,

100
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,640
except now we're using z instead
of t for the parameter name.

101
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,447
The base point of this
parameterization is negative one-half,

102
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:58,280
three-fourths, zero, and the direction
vector of this parameterization is one,

103
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,820
negative two, one.

104
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,380
Here are some different points
that are in the solution set

105
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,260
that we can generate by
picking different values of z.

106
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,060
Picking z=0 gives us the basepoint.

107
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,590
Regardless of the value of z
that is picked, we can check

108
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,520
that the point will be a solution to
the original system of equations.
