1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,530
Here's how we going to do.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,689
The idea is that we're going to classify our image points

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,400
based upon computing those, that Harris matrix, and

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,250
looking at some measure that's a function of its eigenvalues.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,870
And the idea is that in a flat area,

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,990
both of those eigenvalues will be very small.

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,710
In fact if it was perfectly flat,

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,310
everything would be zero because the gradients were zero everywhere.

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,920
And that would mean no matter how I moved, nothing changes, so

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,050
it's a terrible corner.

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,270
Likewise if I have just one of the eigenvalues large,

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,200
that means there's some direction that changes quickly so

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,840
if I move in that direction, I know things have changed.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,930
But if it's zero in the other direction I can move as much as I want.

15
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,840
Remember that's what happened along an edge, so when one eigenvalue is much,

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,830
much bigger than the other then you're along an edge up here.

17
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,770
And when is it a corner?

18
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,970
Well, when both of the eigenvalues are large.

19
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,230
And we'll say that.

20
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,610
It says here that they're approximately the same magnitude.

21
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,080
Just that they're both big enough, and

22
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,880
that the ratio between them should not be terrible, all right?

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,380
If you're, even if they were both large but

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,080
the ratio between them was 10 million, then probably your code was wrong.

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,600
If they're moderately large and your ratio between them is still pretty big,

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,870
then you have to worry because it means one gradient is much much more dominant

27
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,360
than the other, and maybe the noise is affecting the finding of the corner.

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,250
So you want them to be approximately the same magnitude.

29
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,770
So you might think great,

30
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:32,130
that means all I have to do is find the eigenvector, and the eigenvalues, right?

31
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:32,910
Right.

32
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,520
Guess what?

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,320
You don't even have to do that.

34
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,140
This is what was so good about the Harris thing.
