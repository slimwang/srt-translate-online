1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is a blurred image.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
A Gaussian kernel gives us a blurred image.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let me demonstrate this to you.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here is the original image,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and this is the result of convolving with a Gaussian.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You can see that the features are much blurred,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and the reason is each of these pixels

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
is the sum of its weighted neighboring pixels.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And the larger the neighborhood, the more the blurring effect.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You can see clearly the difference in sharpness between these 2 images.
