00:00:03,868 --> 00:00:08,472
friends and family. Often times we talk to our friends and family when we're

00:00:08,472 --> 00:00:11,433
experiencing stressful events and it can help relieve some of the negative

00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:16,790
emotional responses that we have. A second type of coping strategy is the one

00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:21,614

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,250
to reduce our stress. In addition to seeking social support, another

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,210
emotion-focused coping tool is distancing.
