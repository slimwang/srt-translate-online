1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,180
So how does linting help your code?

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,570
The first one here is correct.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,560
Having a linting configuration for
your project helps with code sharing and

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,350
development with multiple team members.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,129
Linting certainly does help
with all these and more.

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,490
Some dead code is easily forgotten and

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,600
can mess up your app
in many obscure ways.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,250
And linting will help find
many of these patterns.

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,910
Linting does not help
identify slow functions.

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,700
Linting works purely by analyzing
the actual source code.

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,680
In order to find out how long
a function takes to execute,

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,870
it needs to run in the browser.

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,830
A linter also doesn't
help with this last one.

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,660
Given the dynamic nature of JavaScript,
often the type information is not known.
