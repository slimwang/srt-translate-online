00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,980
This means that x can be any real number to the right of 50 on the number line,

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,106
since these are the numbers that are greater than 50. But this range doesn't

3
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:12,358
include 50. So we need to pick the parentheses that doesn't show inclusion; this

4
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:12,958
round one.
