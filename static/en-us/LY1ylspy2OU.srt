00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,200
Here is one way to explain the Mapreduce programming

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,850
model. Say that I wanted to count the number of

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,930
occurrences of each word that appears at least once in

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,460
a document. Let's use the text of Alice in Wonderland.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,750
Here's a bit of text that says Alice was

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,400
begining to get very tired of sitting by her sister

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,560
on the bank And of having nothing to do. If

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,600
I wanted to solve this problem without Mapreduce, I might

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,680
create a Python dictionary consisting of all the words

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,600
and their counts. I could go through the document

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,570
and say, for each word in the document, if

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,980
there is a key for that word, add one.

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,375
Otherwise, set the initial for that key equal to

14
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,590
one. And instead of applying it to this short

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,070
sentence fragment from the book, we'd apply it to

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,640
the entire book. Before we solve this problem with Mapreduce,

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,480
why don't you try to write a Python script

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,720
along the lines of what we just discussed, that will

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,060
get the job done. Given many lines of a text,

20
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,530
create a dictionary with a key for each word, and

21
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,390
a value corresponding to the count of the word in

22
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,880
that text. Note that we want the words to be

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,360
stripped of any capitalization and punctuation. We just want the

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,920
basic words. Here's some code to get you started. First,

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,990
we import system string. And then we

26
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,360
initialize an empty dictionary, which will hold our

27
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,840
words and values. We cycle through the lines of the input, and for each line we

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,730
create an array, data. Which is essentially all

29
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,700
of the words in that line, split by

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,780
white space. So if we started with this

31
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,060
line. Hello, how are you? It would become,

32
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:47,910
hello, how, are, and you, in an array of length four. Your code should go here.

33
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,120
After we split the line by white space, and before we print out the dictionary.
