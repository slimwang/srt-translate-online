1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,770
Now we're going to explore these
ideas in a thought experiment

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,700
called the coin flipping casino.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:13,270
So, instead of buying and selling
stocks, we're going to flip coins and

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,330
we're going to be on the outcome of
whether those coins come up heads or

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,610
tails.

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,990
So that's analogous to a single
investment in a stock, or

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,740
a single trade in a stock,
where you buy it and hold it and

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,740
either you make money or you lose money.

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,790
Well, we're going to flip a coin and
either make money or lose money.

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,750
Now the coin is biased.

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,800
In other words,
we have information about this coin, and

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,180
we know that it's more likely
to come up heads than tails.

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,575
In fact, that probability is about
0.51 that it will come up heads.

14
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:52,710
So that's our edge, that's like our
alpha when investing in stocks.

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,480
And the uncertainty of the outcome
is like beta in stock investing.

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,210
Here's how betting works.

17
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,330
So you can bet on any particular
coin flip, you can bet n coins.

18
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,930
If you win,
in other words it comes up heads.

19
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,590
You now have 2 n coins.

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,500
If you lose they take your money.

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,530
So this is called an even money bet.

22
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:22,380
So on each outcome you either
make n coins or you lose n coins.

23
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,848
Here's how the casino works.

24
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:29,716
There are 1,000 betting tables
each with their own biased coin,

25
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:32,840
and you have 1,000 tokens.

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,540
So you can chose to
bet however you like.

27
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,200
In other words, you can put ten tokens
on each of a hundred tables, you could

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,910
put a thousand tokens on one table, you
could put one token on all the tables.

29
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,620
Once you've distributed all your tokens,

30
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,540
which represent your bets,
the coins are all flipped at once.

31
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,770
In other words the game runs in
parallel, and for each bet that

32
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:02,070
you made you either Get your winnings or
they take the chips that you bet.

33
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,840
So now that we've set up this
environment for us to experiment with,

34
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,940
I want you to think
a little bit about it and

35
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:13,360
think about how would you
allocate these tokens?

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,640
Is it better to bet all your
tokens on just one coin flip, or

37
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,850
is it better to bet on
multiple coin flips at once?
