00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,450
So far we've been talking a bit about
Grand Central Dispatch, or GCD but

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,780
without getting into too many details.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,940
Time to put an end to that.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,940
GCD is an open source framework
from Apple for both iOS and OS 10.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,340
It's one of the crown jewels of
the Apple's programming stack.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,760
For reasons that are beyond this course
dealing directly with threads in

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,400
inherently dangerous and complicated.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,140
This is one of the reasons
why concurrent programming

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,400
has always been available only to gurus.

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,650
Not anymore.

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,580
GCG makes concurrent programming
approachable by mere mortals

12
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,450
by hiding threads, and
using queues of closures instead.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,350
How on earth does this help?

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,950
Patience young padawan,
lets start with a queue.

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,610
A queue is like a line
at the super market,

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,270
each customer is a closure
waiting to reach the cashier.

17
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,660
The cashier is a thread that
picks a customer, or closure, and

18
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,550
allows it to run.

19
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,400
Once the closure finishes running,
it is removed from the queue, and

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,860
the next one in line runs.
