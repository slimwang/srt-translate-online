Hi. I'm Andy.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I graduated college in 2009, and I started traveling the world, biking across the country,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and basically living the life of a drifter.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
When I found out about Udacity, I decided this was the job for me.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Last semester I TA'd Sebastian's class on Programming a Robotic Car,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and this semester I'm going to be TAing Peter's class on the Design of Computer Programs.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm going to be available in the forums to help you with your questions,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm going to record supplementary videos when there's things that seem confusing,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and I'll be there for you to yell at in case the grading scripts don't work,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
though I think we've got most of those bugs ironed out. See you in class.
