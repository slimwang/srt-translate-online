00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,590
Some of the issues that arise when we try to determine relationships.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,330
First of all, all of the indicated classes are really part of

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,650
an overarching TreeCountingSystem class, as we mentioned before.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,180
Such system classes are not normally displayed in these diagrams. But

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,320
you can think of each of the rectangles as being a part of, or an attribute of.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,260
The, this overarching class. The textual description from which we, began was

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,100
not truly characteristic, obviously, of typical requirements documents, which

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,060
can go on for hundreds of pages and have lots of specialized vocabulary. Also,

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,320
we went into implementation details. It was actually describing an algorithm.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,660
Requirements documents don't necessarily describe solutions, they

11
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,230
describe problems. In general it is important to distinguish the analysis and

12
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,210
design phases of a software development effort in order to

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,940
avoid prematurely biasing the approach taken towards solution.
