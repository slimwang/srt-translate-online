1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,140
I save my code, stop and start my server
again, and visit the slash hello page.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,080
And look.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,160
Now my server responds to my input, so

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,790
I can make it say hello
in any language I'd like.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,980
Get this server up and
running on your machine.

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,180
Feel free to use the code in
the instructor notes as reference.
