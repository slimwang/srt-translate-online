1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:00,970
All right.

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,410
So, just to review a little bit, we talked about sort of

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,160
practical application about how to make a mosaic or a panorama.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,910
We said you take a bunch of pictures from the same center of projection,

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,570
same camera position.

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,510
You compute the transformation between each of the images.

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,120
Say the first and second, right?

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,560
What's that transformation going to be?

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,160
Well.

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,020
Same center projection.

11
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,090
It's going to be homography.

12
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,390
You then use that homography to transform, say,

13
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,160
the first image to align with the second.

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,300
There'll be some overlap, so

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,040
you'll have to blend them, and then you can continue to do that.

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,000
So, that was for the, the cool application.

17
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,350
But the theory, and this is really important part,

18
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,110
is that homographies map from planes to planes.

19
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,950
And this allows us to compute what a different image plane would look like from

20
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,100
the same center of projection.

21
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,530
So we can build mosaics by projecting a set of

22
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,480
images that are all taken from the, the same camera center.

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,870
And in, in general, what we're doing is we're going to be,

24
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,780
we're working more in this projective relationship between image planes.

25
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,040
So that ends the lesson on homographics and mosaics.

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,880
That was kind of the cool part with a very gentle introduction to

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,440
projective geometry.

28
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,280
Now we're going to do a little bit more serious, or next lesson I'd say, we're

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,830
going to do a little more serious conversation about projected geometry and

30
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,820
the duality between points and lines.

31
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,210
How often do you get to use the word duality in a, at a party?

32
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,555
I mean, seriously.

33
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:27,490
We're going to talk about the duality between points and

34
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,430
lines, and that will help us get to relationship between sort of

35
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,730
arbitrary cameras that you might, I don't know,

36
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,520
want to do stereo matching between, or some other alignment between those views.
