Okay, now that we've talked about the
theory, let's get some code going on.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,630
We're going to take an existing app and
make it work offline first.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,760
We saw it briefly in

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,670
a simple social networking timeline.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,840
It's currently slow in

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,810
a total failure offline.

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:17,550
We're going to fix that.
