00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Evans] Now the answer is the third one--

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
that it makes it about 4000 times harder.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So to compute a dictionary that would be effective against all the different salts,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the attacker really needs to pre-compute that dictionary for all the different salt values

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
to be able to look for passwords that match.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So salting adds a lot of value for very little cost.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We just need some extra bits that don't need to be kept secret

8
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that are stored in our password file.
