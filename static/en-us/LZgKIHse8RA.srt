1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,844
The first answer is 3x, and our second answer is 2 plus 2 times the cube root

2
00:00:04,844 --> 00:00:10,280
of 6. Great thinking for getting those two correct. Now, these were a little

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,307
bit tricky because you had to keep in mind we had cube roots. We can multiply

4
00:00:14,307 --> 00:00:20,580
these two radicals together since the indexes match, so we'll get 27x cubed.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,676
The factor of 3 appears three times underneath the radical as is the factor of

6
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:30,600
x. This means we pull out one 3 and one x to get 3x. This should also make

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,112
sense. We've seen the cube root of 27 before, and we know that's 3. And using

8
00:00:35,112 --> 00:00:40,000
power divided by root, we'll have 3 divided by 3 which is x to the 1. For our

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,116
second problem, we'll distribute the cube root of 2 to each of these terms. So,

10
00:00:44,116 --> 00:00:49,735
we'll have the cube root of 8 and the cube root of 48. We know the cube root of

11
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:52,815
8 is simply 2, and we can split up the cube root of 48 into cube root of 8

12
00:00:52,815 --> 00:00:57,987
times 6. We use our product rule to split this up into cube root of 8 times the

13
00:00:57,987 --> 00:01:03,106
cube root of 6, and simplify once again to get our final result. You might not

14
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:06,600
have always shown this step throughout your problem solving, and that's okay.

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,900
You just really want to be careful when you take cube roots of numbers. Put the

16
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,500
factor on the outside, and leave anything else inside the radical.
