1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,770
In Milgram's study, he obviously could not tell the participants that it was a

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,414
study on obedience to authority. Instead, he told them it was a study of

3
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:14,240
memory. And here you can see the original advertisement that Milgram used. When

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,364
the participant arrived, there were always two other people present. One was

5
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:22,821
Milgram, who was the experimenter and then there was another person. And

6
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:26,526
Milgram had these two people draw slips to determine whether they're going to

7
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:31,919
be a teacher or they're going to be a learner. Unbeknownst to the participant

8
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:37,092
the person who was with Milgram was actually confederate. Meaning that person

9
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:42,344
was working for Milgram. Therefore, when they chose slips, Milgram had arranged

10
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:46,126
it that the real participant was always the teacher, and the learner was a

11
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:51,580
confederate, or a person who was working with Milgram. Now remember the

12
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,371
participant thought this was a study on memory. So Milgram told the participant

13
00:00:56,371 --> 00:01:00,403
that he was going to read a series of words and that the other participant, the

14
00:01:00,403 --> 00:01:06,753
learner, who was a confederate, would have to remember those words. Every time

15
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:13,520
the learner would get a word incorrect, the teacher was to deliver a shock. The

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,829
learner was to memorize those word lists. And provide correct answers. And

17
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:22,574
during the study Milgram, who was the experimenter, observed the teacher and

18
00:01:22,574 --> 00:01:28,251
provided instruction. So here the teacher thought that he was to read words and

19
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:32,598
deliver shocks, but in fact Milgram was testing that participants level of

20
00:01:32,598 --> 00:01:39,356
obedience aAs well as his willingness to inflict pain to the learner. Now,

21
00:01:39,356 --> 00:01:43,758
remember the learner was a confederate working for Milgram, and he did not

22
00:01:43,758 --> 00:01:48,864
receive any actual shocks. And he actually didn't even respond to the word

23
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:53,845
lists. All of the responses were pre-programmed. And finally MIlgram served as

24
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:57,562
the authority figure in this study and he was positioned next to the teacher

25
00:01:57,562 --> 00:02:03,360
while the teacher was reading the words and supposedly delivering the shocks.

26
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,645
So we had the teacher, the learner and Milgram. Now let's go into a little more

27
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:13,256
details on the specific methods of the experiment. The teacher and learner were

28
00:02:13,256 --> 00:02:16,496
to be tested in seperate rooms, but before the learner left, the teacher

29
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:22,310
actually was hooked up to the shock machine and received a very small shock.

30
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,070
And this was to let the teacher know that the shock generator actually worked.

31
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,220
And also so the teacher was aware of the type of shocks that the learner would

32
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,491
experience. Millgram instructed the teacher to provide a shock for every

33
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:40,151
incorrect response. And, they would start at the low end of the shock

34
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:44,710
generator. And with each consecutive incorrect response, the teacher had to

35
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:52,876
provide a shock. And, that went up on the shock generator to 450 volts. So

36
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:57,446
here's the experimental arrangement. Here we had the teacher, who is sitting in

37
00:02:57,446 --> 00:03:01,045
front of the voltage machine, and notice that the learner is in a separate

38
00:03:01,045 --> 00:03:06,178
room. Remember, the learner is the confederate and when the study began, he

39
00:03:06,178 --> 00:03:11,888
actually just left the room. All of the responses were pre-programmed. Notice,

40
00:03:11,888 --> 00:03:16,280
too, that Milgram was sitting near the teacher as he was observing that person.
