1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,770
So this lecture is for facilitators and coaches, sometimes called the instructors or mentors.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:10,070
Why you're here is I'm just going to go through a brief explanation

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,960
of what it is you're doing while the students are watching the lectures

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,690
and working on their presentations and getting out of the building and presenting.

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,310
What do you do?

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,730
My suggestion is to get us all aligned,

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,690
rather than me have to repeat all of the lectures we're giving the students,

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:31,050
is you need to go watch Lecture 0, Lecture 1, Lecture 1.5

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,020
and find your copy of the Lean LaunchPad Educators Guide.

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,310
That's kind of your prep work for the rest of this conversation.

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,730
This might take an hour or 2 to watch all these lectures

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,360
and kind of get up to speed on the material, but it's well worth your time.

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,010
Also, if you don't have a copy, please get a copy of Alexander Osterwalder's

14
00:00:51,010 --> 99:59:59,999
Business Model Generation book and a copy of The Startup Owner's Manual.
