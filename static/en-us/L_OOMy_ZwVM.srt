1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,698
Now that we know what vertex form looks like for equations of problems that have

2
00:00:04,698 --> 00:00:09,384
leading coefficients other than 1, let's see if we can get this equation in this

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:13,970
form. We have y equals 3x squared plus 6x minus 10. Now what was that tool we

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,926
used before to get equations in vertex form? It was called completing the

5
00:00:17,926 --> 00:00:21,322
square. So that's what we need to do here, complete the square. The process is

6
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:24,598
going to be slightly different, since we have this 3 present now, instead of a 1

7
00:00:24,598 --> 00:00:27,949
in front of the x squared. But, let's give it a try. Well, the first thing we

8
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:31,415
did before, when we were starting to complete the square. Was recognize that

9
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:35,127
this constant over here is probably not the constant we're going to need if we

10
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:39,010
want a perfect square term on the right hand side of the equation. So we want to

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,301
get the constant off the right hand side and onto the left hand side. So if we

12
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:45,953
do that, what does our equation look like now?
