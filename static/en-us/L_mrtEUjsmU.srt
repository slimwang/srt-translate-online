1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,500
In the next quiz, you'll use
the two functions you just wrote,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,460
random noun and random verb.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,100
And another function,
called word transformer.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,060
Which takes in a string and
returns a random verb, a random noun, or

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,620
the first character of a word.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,770
Depending on the contents
of the variable passed in.

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,930
As you can see,
this would be a helpful function for

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,140
the Mad Libs generator we're
very close to building.
