1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's how this works as a protocol--we have two participants.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We'll call Alice the generator--that means she is going to make the circuit,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and Bob the evaluator--that means he's going to evaluate the circuit.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
At the beginning of the protocol, they've agreed on some circuit they want to evaluate.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
For this to be interesting would be much larger than that.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It takes inputs from both Bob and from Alice.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Alice is going to generate a garble table for each one of these logic gates in the circuit,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and send the garbled circuit to Bob.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
She is also going to send her input values, but because they're

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
random nonces Bob can't tell what they mean.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Bob's going to evaluate the circuit using the garbled circuit protocol

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
decrypting one entry from each of these.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
At the end of this, Bob's going to get some output values.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Then they're going to do something to turn that into the semantic value,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
which possibly Bob receives, possibly Alice receives.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We can design the protocol either way.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I am not going to talk about that final step of how you turn the encrypted values

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
at the end of the circuit into meaningful values.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We'll leave that as a question for your exam.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But there is one more question that I do need to talk about.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's the question of how does Bob obtain his inputs to the circuit.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
To evaluate these tables, Bob needs to have both Alice's inputs and his inputs.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Here are the choices. Bob could generate them himself.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
He could ask Alice to provide his inputs.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
He could ask Alice for both possible values for all these wire labels,

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and then select the right one corresponding to his inputs.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Or none of these possibilities actually work.
