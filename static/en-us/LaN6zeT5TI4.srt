1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,296
One possible answer is this equation. We're going to square this leg of the

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:09,740
triangle. Add it to the square of this leg of the triangle. Which is equal to d

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,899
squared, hypotenuse. This is really just the Pythagorean theorem. We have a

4
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:20,880
number squared. Plus another number squared. Equals they hypotenuse squared.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,530
And what we could do is take the square root of both sides of the equation.

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:29,630
This would leave us with d equal to the square root of x2 minus x1 squared,

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:36,070
plus y2 minus y1 squared. Great thinking if you got either of the equations.

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,334
Now, the order of these variables doesn't actually matter, since we're squaring

9
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:43,587
the numbers. If we wound up with a negative value here, it would become

10
00:00:43,587 --> 00:00:48,698
positive, since we're squaring it. The same is true for the y value. If this

11
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:52,718
value is negative, and we squared it, it would wind up being positive. So,

12
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:56,942
perhaps an easier way to think about it, is just, think about the change in the

13
00:00:56,942 --> 00:01:02,180
x and the change in the y. How far did we travel this way, and how far did we

14
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,739
travel this way. We'll square both of those, take their sum, and then take the

15
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:11,865
square root to find the distance. This symbol right here that you see here is

16
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:15,770
delta and itâs a Greek letter that means change. You may have seen this in

17
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,460
chemistry or in other courses. And this delta just means change. I think itâs

18
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,356
easy to think about the change in the x values. And the change in the y values

19
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:29,832
to find our answer. This is more simple than writing this crazy notation.

20
00:01:29,832 --> 00:01:33,528
Memorizing the formula is not so important as really understanding that we're

21
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:37,000
setting up a right triangle in space, when we find the distance between two

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,910
points. That can always help you problem solve.
