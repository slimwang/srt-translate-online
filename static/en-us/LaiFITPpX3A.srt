00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,490
Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Hippocrates. I'm a natural

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,140
philosopher from over 2400 years ago,

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,210
and I've studied the mechanisms of inheritance.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,150
>> Okay, well lay it on us.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,330
>> It's called Blended Inheritance.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,730
>> Well, what's Blended Inheritance?

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,370
>> Blended Inheritance is the idea that

8
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,350
one particular trait in an offspring came

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,810
from one of the parents directly or is a mix of the parents traits.

10
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,330
>> But how do you think that works, exactly? I'm not exactly sure,

11
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,650
but I've seen this fluid that comes from the

12
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,990
male reproductive organ, and I think females probably have something

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,780
similiar. My theory is that it's a mix based

14
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,440
on the battle of fluids between the male and female.

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,730
>> Hm, well I'm pretty sure you're right about the male reproductive fluid.

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,100
>> But I think you're a little behind the times on the female fluid.

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,930
>> My theory is that these fluids are actually an

18
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,580
amalgamation of fluids from throughout the whole body. Each responsible

19
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,940
for forming that particular part. The fluid from the toes

20
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,670
is responsible for forming the toes, and the fluid from

21
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,650
the eyes is responsible for forming more eyes, and so

22
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,550
on. At conception, a battle of fluid takes place, and the

23
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,950
child will resemble aspects of whichever fluid wins that battle;

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,650
one or the other parents, or a mix of both. Ok.

25
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,210
I mean, even though we know a lot more about

26
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,730
how reproduction works now, your idea of blended inheritance does sound

27
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,400
kind of reasonable.

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,800
>> But, I can think of an example that breaks the rule of inheritance. Which

29
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,910
of the following scenarios do you think shows

30
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,440
that Hippocrates's blending model doesn't explain every trait?
