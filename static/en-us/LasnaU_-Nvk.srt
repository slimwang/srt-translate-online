00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,170
Alright so we should have copied and

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:06,850
pasted this code snippet from the gist
into your Pet Provider class.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,100
And this is the code for

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,550
how you should have added the two
URI patterns to your URI matcher.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,290
So first we call sUriMatcher.addURI and

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,260
pass in the pet content authority and
the pets path.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,440
So this Uri pattern will be
assigned integer code pets,

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,670
which maps to the value 100.

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,159
And so, if the URI matches this pattern,

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,740
we know that we need to act
on the entire Pets table.

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,016
So, for the second URI,
we also call sUriMatcher.addURI,

12
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:43,360
and pass in the pet content authority,

13
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:50,080
as well as the pets path which
has slash pound appended to it,

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,840
which refers the ID of the specific
row were interested in.

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,040
Now this URI pattern will be assigned
to the integer code PETS_ID,

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,650
which maps to the value 101.

17
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,661
So in Editor Studio, this is what
the pet provider class will look like.

18
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:09,805
[BLANK_AUDIO]

19
00:01:09,805 --> 00:01:13,111
Now, to double check that our codes
still works, I'll compile and

20
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:13,750
run the app.

21
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,948
[BLANK_AUDIO]

22
00:01:16,948 --> 00:01:19,583
So there are no visible changes
in the UIs expected, but

23
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:23,240
there's still a bit more left to do,
so let's keep working on the provider.
