00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,859
great job so far in this lesson you've
used image analysis techniques like

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:10,410
candy edge detection and hot transforms
to find lane lines in images these are

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,009
the exact same techniques that you're
going to need for the first project so

4
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,010
Ryan what will students be doing for the
first project

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,839
well your goal in this first project is
to write a software pipeline to identify

6
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,618
and track the position of the lane lines
in a video stream that might sound

7
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:30,359
complicated but don't worry you can do
it a video is really just a series of

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,009
images so you already have the tools you
need to do this project

9
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:39,899
awesome this project is your first step
toward becoming a real self driving car

10
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,009
engineer and in fact this was one of my
first projects when I was wanting to

11
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:46,738
become a self-driving car engineer so
let's get to it
