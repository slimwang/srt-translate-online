00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,810
Hurray, you're done implementing
wire frames for the app.

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,060
Now comes the visual polish part, 
where we tweak the styles

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,430
and the views to make
the app look awesome.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,620
Here's the visual mocks, 
for what the app should look like

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,040
when we're done.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,900
If you work with a designer,
they should also give you redlines.

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:21,360
Redlines specify everything from sizes,
font styles, colors, spacing, etc.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,320
This should help you achieve
pixel perfect layouts

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,450
that match the visual mocks.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,480
How did we come up with these values?

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,150
Well we used the Android design guide

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,119
which has information
on metrics and grids,

13
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,275
and we adapted them
to fit our app's needs.

00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:38,000
