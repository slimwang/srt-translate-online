1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,560
So I'm actually going to go ahead and

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,290
check the first one as
the correct answer.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,029
Clearly whether it is to
do with theft of data,

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,590
identify theft, or
theft of intellectual property,

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,840
somebody invading your privacy,
we need laws against those.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,730
Those people shouldn't be able to do
it without any sort of a consequence.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,902
So criminal sanctions against
those kind of activities,

8
00:00:23,902 --> 00:00:29,390
in particular those cyber-crime laws,
are necessary and we have them.

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,640
If you're going to pick the second
option, we will actually talk about

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,930
a number of challenges that you have
to deal with when you have laws.

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,762
And you perhaps can take
the position that no really laws,

12
00:00:42,762 --> 00:00:47,606
this notion of what is right or
wrong, we can debate that.

13
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:51,909
Sometimes, while they're overarching and
things like that, but

14
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:54,777
this is more about
having legal deterrents,

15
00:00:54,777 --> 00:00:59,771
that their consequences intend on doing
harm to others, their consequence.

16
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:00,840
I'm going to go over this one
