1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
You can review the log of command entered by going to the history

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,740
so that would be panel two. Help documentation appears in the lower right

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,070
hand side which would be panel four. To clear the work space you

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,520
can either use panel two or panel three. You can run a command

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,329
in here to clear the work space or you can use the icon

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,590
located in panel two. It should look like a sweeping broom. We can

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,040
run a bunch of commands from a file from panel one. Plots appear

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,790
down here in the lower right, so that would be panel four, and

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,220
all of our objects and memory appear up here, in

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,300
our environment or our work space. So that's panel two. And

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,610
finally to read the results from functions or from calculations, we

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,950
simply look at the console, where our output comes, panel three.
