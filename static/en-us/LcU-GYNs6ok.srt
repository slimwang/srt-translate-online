1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,530
Going back to our Soonami app code,

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,696
we see that the HTTP request
method is set to GET.

3
00:00:05,696 --> 00:00:07,469
So why is this the case?

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:10,642
Use your knowledge about what you
just learned about the HTTP request

5
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,260
method types to answer
the question here.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,600
In the Soonami app HTTP request,

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,760
why are we using a GET method
instead of a POST method?
