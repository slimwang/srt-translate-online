00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,710
It's important to note that geolocation isn't just about your

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,270
position on a map, it's also incredibly useful for location

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,860
aware presentation. For example, for a website for a chain

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,320
of stores, right in the front page you can show what

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,550
the closest store is to the user's current location. And

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,690
what their current hours are. This is almost certainly exactly

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,950
what the user was looking for when they navigated to

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,890
your app. You don't have to bury it under a store

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,870
locator link. You can certainly do lots of other things with geolocation,

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:34,890
too. You could use geolocation to implement a geocaching game, for example,

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,470
or to do augmented reality. But Geolocation has many uses that just

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,730
make the user experience better by

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,970
better integrating with the real world environment.
