1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the correct answer here is 'way more than that.'

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,300
It's 2^500, which is approximately 10^150.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,640
So, that's not even a number we have a sensible name for.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:21,780
So, Alice's algorithm, while being correct, does not offer any way of finding

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,620
the solution for the problem that she's working on.

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,620
And now, of course, the question is

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,260
if this is just because Alice wasn't able to think of a better algorithm than this, here,

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,090
or because the problem that she's working on

9
00:00:34,090 --> 99:59:59,999
is actually a hard problem to solve.
