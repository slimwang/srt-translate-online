1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's see if we understood inclusion.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,540
Let's say that we have a level one and

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,390
level two cache that
maintain inclusion property.

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,900
Let's say that the dirty block is
replaced from the level one cache

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,580
by something else, and
we need to write it back.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,000
This write-back access,
can it be a level two hit, and

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,910
can it be a level two miss?

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,620
So check here.

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:29,440
If the right back axis from
level one can be a hit in L2,

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,650
check here, if the right back axis
from L1 can be a level two miss.

11
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,807
Now let's look at the level one and
level two cache, but

12
00:00:38,807 --> 00:00:43,520
this time, they make no
attempt to maintain inclusion.

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,476
Again, if we have a dirty block
replaced from the level one cache,

14
00:00:48,476 --> 00:00:51,710
the level one cache
has to write it back.

15
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:57,050
This write-back, can it be a level two
hit and can it be a level two miss?
