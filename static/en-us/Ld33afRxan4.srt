1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,310
So your style should
look something like this.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:08,710
We have a bluish color in red-green-blue
notation, and a bold style.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,490
Now one thing that you might want to
notice is over here in the column,

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,890
it shows you a small preview
of what the color is.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,900
So if we go over to our design view,

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,400
we can see that the text has
changed to a bolder blue color.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,130
Styles and

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,530
themes bring the unique character of
your company's product to your app.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,700
We will do a formal deep dive
in lesson three when we discuss,

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,380
Bold graphic design.

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,490
In the meantime, you can take a look
at some open-source apps like

12
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:41,090
the 2014 Google IO Scheduler app or
this list on Wikipedia

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,710
of open-source Android apps
to see what others have done.

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,790
Now, be advised that not all of these
apps use material design principles,

15
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,700
you might see some old UIs in there.
