00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,475
Remember, we're trying to find a confidence interval for the true difference

2
00:00:03,475 --> 00:00:08,715
between the pairs of shoes owned by males and females. Since we're concerned

3
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:12,290
with the difference, we wouldn't use one of our two samples means for our point

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,902
estimate. We would use the difference between them. And it doesn't matter which

5
00:00:16,902 --> 00:00:21,585
direction we go. We can either use the positive or negative t critical value as

6
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:29,367
well. 0.96 is our t statistic. We don't want that. We want the cutoff for the

7
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:35,772
middle 95%. And finally, for our standard error, we calculated that to be

8
00:00:35,772 --> 00:00:39,270
15.72. And the standard error is never negative.
