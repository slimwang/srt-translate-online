1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,900
What this means as far as the actual delivery of services is once again you

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,030
have self contained, self defined modular applications.

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,900
You can think of these as more or less vertical slices through the system.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,750
That each service is capable of self contained that it

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,790
has all that it needs in order to provide that functionality to the user.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,960
There's a definition for it, so that the remainder of the system and

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,220
the architecture can have a configuration that it understands. And it's modular,

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,270
okay? It obeys certain rules about interactions. In particular,

9
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,560
there's a use protocol use at the level of

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,890
the software architecture protocol describing, how the pieces work together.

11
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:53,980
The overall intent is to try to directly relate, the business needs of the user,

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,750
to functionality that's being provided. And typically this means that

13
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,920
as a developer, an architect, you're coming up with a suite of sub-services,

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,700
that together can be composed into. These user facing services. You publish

15
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,230
them, you located them in particular places and you can dynamically invoke them.
