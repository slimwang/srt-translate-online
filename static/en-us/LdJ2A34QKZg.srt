1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,575
Alright, Sara, I did what you said I should never do, I styled a div.

2
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:03,922
>> Alright.

3
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:07,446
>> So, I gave it, I gave all div's black backgrounds, and I don't even

4
00:00:07,446 --> 00:00:09,350
really know what this does, but I

5
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,629
said margin 100, what I'm guessing means pixels?

6
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:13,649
>> Pixels, yes

7
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:13,870
>> I saw that, you know.

8
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,900
>> So some of these are going to get overridden by

9
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,952
specific rules on like name divs that have class names, but.

10
00:00:21,952 --> 00:00:23,170
>> Sara, you said I shouldn't do it.

11
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,019
>> No. Are you willing to put your money where, where your mouth is?

12
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:25,479
>> It's going

13
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:26,086
to look funny.

14
00:00:26,086 --> 00:00:30,430
>> Yeah? Oh, crap. [LAUGH] It looks really. Hey, I'm still.

15
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,120
>> Hey, you're still playing.

16
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,049
>> I'm still doing well actually.

17
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,220
>> You're combing things somehow.

18
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,950
>> Yeah. Oh, my goodness. Oh, there they are.

19
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,150
>> You can probably see how to combine them here. Maybe.

20
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,513
>> Wow.

21
00:00:38,513 --> 00:00:38,918
>> That's interesting.

22
00:00:38,918 --> 00:00:43,120
>> Okay, so. [LAUGH] I guess, don't style your divs, is probably good advice.

23
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,370
>> Yeah.
