We just heard some great stories from
Googlers about how they deal with

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,350
uncertainty.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,097
And now you're going to get a chance
to deal with uncertainty too.

4
00:00:07,097 --> 00:00:09,978
In this next coding task,
you're going to add a text field

5
00:00:09,978 --> 00:00:13,227
into the app so that someone can
enter their name, like Larry or

6
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:15,580
Kevin, into the app for
their coffee order.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,526
At first you might not know how to
deal with something like this, but

8
00:00:19,526 --> 00:00:20,127
that's okay.

9
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:22,227
You can Google search for it online.

10
00:00:22,227 --> 00:00:25,610
And, like my mom always says,
you can just take it one step at a time.

11
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,100
The app should look something like
this and here's the name field.

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,790
There's a special type of view in
Android that can handle text input.

13
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,280
So when you tap on the field,
then the keyboard pops up.

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,790
When the field is blank,

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,430
it gives you some hint text to tell
you what you should type here.

16
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,100
As soon as you start typing,
then that hint text goes away.

17
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,780
When you're done typing,
you can just hide the keyboard.

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,960
You've probably seen this view
many times before in other apps.

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,220
For example, in chat applications,
you type your message into a field and

20
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,980
then send it off to someone.

21
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,050
This is actually quite a complex view,
lots of things are happening

22
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,310
behind the scenes, but luckily,
Android handles all of that for us.

23
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,300
Okay, go ahead and add this field
to your app, then make a change so

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,050
that when the user hits the order
button, the name also appears there.

25
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,072
First, plan out the steps
that you need to do.

26
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:14,977
You can write your answer here.

27
00:01:14,977 --> 00:01:18,027
As you do each step, you can
Google search for how to do it and

28
00:01:18,027 --> 00:01:19,369
find example code for it,

29
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:23,330
or you can look at the common
Android views cheat sheet for ideas.

30
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,090
You can also use logging to verify
the value of variables along the way

31
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,370
as you do each of these steps.

32
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,940
When you're done,
answer these questions on the right.

33
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,960
What view did you end up adding?

34
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,910
And what Java method gets you
the text that the user entered?

35
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,960
And lastly, what's the return
data type of this method?

36
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,750
