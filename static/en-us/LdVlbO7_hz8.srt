00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,300
Hi, my name is Victor Tsaran.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,130
And I work as a technology
program manager at Google.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,970
At Google I work on making sure
that the products we create

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,180
are accessible to the audience
of our diverse users,

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,140
regardless of their ability or
impairment.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,750
Modern web technologies make
it very easy for a developer

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,890
to create a website that's difficult for
someone who is blind to use.

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,500
If a user has no vision, it's quite
likely they would be using a screen

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,140
reader, which is a software
that allows them to

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,680
hear the information displayed on the
screen via a text to speech synthesizer.

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,650
They may also be using Braille which
allows them to feel the on-screen

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,430
text with their fingers
when using braille display.

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,750
Many websites are visual in their
nature and lack keyboard navigation

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,730
which is essential for blind people to
be able to navigate through the content.

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,470
In general, it is safe to assume
that there are more people with

16
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,900
visual impairments,
that is people who have some sight,

17
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,770
as opposed to people who
are completely blind.

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,386
There are also people
with low visual acuity.

19
00:01:11,386 --> 00:01:14,479
And they may be using
large print text or

20
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,887
magnification when using the computer,
for example,

21
00:01:18,887 --> 00:01:23,388
my friend Laura uses magnification
with text to speech,

22
00:01:23,388 --> 00:01:26,882
as well as various
color contrast options.

23
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:27,968
>> Let's meet up at the coffee shop.

24
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:31,124
I can order something for
you, iced coffee okay?

25
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:34,740
>> And I haven't mentioned
people with poor color vision

26
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,629
who may have difficulty distinguishing
red and green or blue and yellow.

27
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:43,440
This accounts for
9% of male and 1% of female.

28
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,580
We may also find ourselves
with temporary challenges,

29
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,760
such as when trying to use a computer in
the sun or looking at a dodgy projector.

30
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,920
Whenever accessibility
comes up in a conversation,

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,680
people tend to picture someone
who is blind like myself.

32
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,310
But there actually more impairments
to think about and consider.

33
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,056
There is a huge number of people
with motor or dexterity impairments.

34
00:02:09,056 --> 00:02:12,969
Such users may be using
only the keyboard, head or

35
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:17,640
eye tracking software,
switches, voice dictation etc.

36
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,330
Someone may have a broken wrist,
broken track pad, or

37
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,740
simply riding the Shaker train.

38
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,780
By catering to users with
permanent dexterity impairments,

39
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,050
we ensure a great experience for
everyone.

40
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,840
There are also users
with hearing impairments.

41
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,210
For example, some may be completely
deaf, yet others have some hearing.

42
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:49,159
The content that uses sound should
provide some kind of visual alternative.

43
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:53,729
For example, a messenger app could
be using a flashing alert as well

44
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:55,504
as sound notifications.

45
00:02:55,504 --> 00:02:59,928
There are also users with
cognitive impairments, for

46
00:02:59,928 --> 00:03:03,490
example ADD, dyslexia or autism.

47
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,890
These users may require
diverse accommodations,

48
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:11,250
such as zooming the screen to make
it easier to read the content,

49
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:17,440
or minimal design to minimize
destruction and cognitive load.

50
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,850
We can all probably relate to
feeling stressful or cognitive load.

51
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,500
So improving the experience for users
with cognitive impairments makes it so

52
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,360
much better experience for
everybody else.

53
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,545
In summary, accessibility is
really about making sure that

54
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:40,905
the content and
the websites we create is

55
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:45,355
usable to people with various
impairments or abilities.
