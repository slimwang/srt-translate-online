00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,750
Quiz time.

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:06,000
Here are two parallel algorithms
with the work and span as shown.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,500
My question for you is,
which parallel algorithm is better?

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,990
And my follow up question is why.

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,050
Now, this is a,
somewhat open ended question.

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,470
And so there are no wrong answers.

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,990
What I want you to do
is think about it and
