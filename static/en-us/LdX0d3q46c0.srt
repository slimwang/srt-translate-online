Hey, what's up?

2
00:00:02,055 --> 00:00:05,171
[SOUND] Congrats on completing
your first few lessons of Android

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:05,941
development.

4
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:09,242
You've taken a really big step here,
as one of the major hurdles in learning

5
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,215
something new is just
simply getting going.

6
00:00:11,215 --> 00:00:13,695
We know it can be challenging and
perhaps intimidating and

7
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:15,560
you just tackled that milestone.

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,520
So kudos, the neat thing now,

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,830
is you possess the skills to
make a single screen app.

10
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,580
Go tackle this project head on,
and make it your own.

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,960
I'm looking forward to
seeing what you create.
