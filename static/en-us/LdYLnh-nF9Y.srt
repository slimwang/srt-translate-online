1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,470
All right, well, the HTML is a critical resource. And the CSS style sheet

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,150
inside is also going to be render blocking.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,780
The image doesn't block, the critical rendering path.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,990
And this JavaScript file at the end is also asynchronous and it won't block

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,280
rendering. So in total, that's going to be

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,830
two critical resources, the HTML and the CSS.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,880
>> You nailed it.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,320
>> Now, I didn't ask you about the number

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,320
of critical bytes, but any idea how you would go

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,370
about figuring that out?

11
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:32,060
>> Simple. I just need to know the size of the HTML and the CSS files.

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,210
>> Yup, exactly.

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,530
>> Now, what about the critical path length?

14
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,180
>> So, let's see, the HTML file is 1. We have

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,340
another round trip to get to CSS. And then, because this

16
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,490
JavaScript file is async, it's not going to block rendering. So, the

17
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,170
best case is going to be two, as our critical path length.

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:50,510
>> That's right.
