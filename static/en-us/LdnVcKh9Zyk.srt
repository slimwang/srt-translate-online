1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,100
So to quickly summarize,
we learned about image transformations,

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,110
not just about image filtering.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,880
Remember, we talked a lot
about how to do warping in

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,690
things like even when we
played around with panoramas.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,890
This is some of the foundations
that we're going to use.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,379
We're going to talk about morphing,
but we're going to come back and

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,360
use these, not just image filtering,
but image transformations and warping

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,440
to help us do the kinds of computational
photography that we are interested in.

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,580
We basically looked at all kinds
of transformations, rigid,

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,540
projective transformations of images.

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,430
And we actually kind of
looked at what parameters and

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,900
how to do this simple types
of things using matrices.

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,860
If anybody's curious,

14
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,730
more, more detail exists on chapter
2 of the Rick Szeliski book.

15
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:40,480
I look it up.

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,440
And also, I just, of course, as usual,

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,440
relied on other people's slides to
generate the slides that you saw.

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,440
More information will be
available on the website.
