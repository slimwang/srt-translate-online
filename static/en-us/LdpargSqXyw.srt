00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,700
Now, let's discuss some of
the details of viruses.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,760
First, let's take a look
at the structure of virus.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,630
A virus infects a program by
modifying the program code.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,140
That is, the virus code has
to be physically inserted

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,900
into the program file.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,300
Logically, when
the infected program runs,

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,180
the virus' codes run first,
then the original program will run, so

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,410
that the user will not suspect that
the program has been infected.

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,760
And then at the end,

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,680
there could some virus code that
does clean up to avoid detection.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,659
If you look at the infected program,

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:37,310
the first line controls that the virus
program will always run first.

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,950
It is critically important to put
this control in the first line

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,560
of the infected program, because this
is the only way to guarantee that

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,840
the virus code will always be run
whenever the program executes.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,969
It is also important to put
a marker in the infected program.

17
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,953
Such as putting a special flag in the
second line of the infected program to

18
00:00:57,953 --> 00:01:01,630
indicate whether the program has
been infected by the virus or not.

19
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,019
Otherwise a program can
be repeatedly infected.

20
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:10,310
When the virus code is run, it typically
first finds other programs to infect.

21
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,230
Of course, it will check whether
a program has been infected already

22
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,220
by looking at the special flag.

23
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,900
In addition to infecting other programs,
the virus code can also perform other

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,780
malicious activities on the system,
such as stealing valuable documents.

25
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,350
After performing the malicious
actions the virus will then

26
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,890
transfer the control to
the original program so

27
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,730
that the normal work can be performed in
such a way the user would not notice.

28
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,870
The virus code can also perform other
actions in order to avoid detection.

29
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,490
For example, because the virus code is
physically inserted into the original

30
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,580
program file the file size of the
original program obviously increases.

31
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,145
And this can be a tell tale sign
that a program has been infected.

32
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:57,505
Therefore, in order to avoid detection,

33
00:01:57,505 --> 00:02:01,745
the virus code can compress the infected
program so that the file size

34
00:02:01,745 --> 00:02:05,715
is the same as the size of
the program before it is infected.
