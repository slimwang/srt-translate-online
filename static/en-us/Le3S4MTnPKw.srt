Here's a quiz that covers the various principles that we've seen in the catalog.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,220
James Gosling was the author of the Java programming language.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,330
At a Java users group meeting he was asked,

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,410
if you could do Java all over again, what would you change?

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,590
He replied, I'd leave out classes.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,750
This, of course, got a lot of laughs, and

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,580
after the laughter died down he went on to explain what he meant.

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,506
I'll turn it around and ask you, which of the principles or heuristics that have

9
00:00:24,506 --> 00:00:28,680
been mentioned in this lesson, support Gosling's idea about leaving out classes.
