1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Of course, we'll do a little quiz to have you figure that out.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What I would like you think about is the following:

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm going to give you 3 graphs, and I'm going to ask you

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
for which of these graphs is shortest toward the hardest and the easiest to solve.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So here you have 3 graphs,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and each of these graphs has the same number of vertices

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
in case you're wondering, or at least I hope it does,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I counted twice, but you never know.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And what I want I would like you to tell me now

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
is for which of these graphs you think shortest tour is the hardest to solve

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and for which of these graphs you think is the easiest to solve

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and I've not written any distances on the edges,

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but you can basically assume that I would be able to write

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
any distances that I want on these edges.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's more of a question about the structure of these graphs,

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and for the one that you think is hardest,

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I want you to enter the number 3 in one of these boxes,

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and for the one that you think is easiest,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I want you to enter the number 1,

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and guess what number I want you to enter for the one that is in between.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So please, go ahead.
