00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,150
Alright Michael. I'm going to define a new concept

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,110
for you. It is called the NASH EQUILIBRIUM.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:06,750
>> Nice.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,180
>> Okay, here's the set up. You have n players. So we move beyond simply

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,310
two players. You have n players. And

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,149
each player has strategies that it can chose

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,530
from. So here I'm referring to them as, S1, these are all the strategies for

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,630
player one. As two are all the strategies for player two up to S N

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,010
all the players for strategy N. Got it?

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,850
>> Yep. Okay so each of these are set, so im

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:35,900
going to say that the particular strategies, S1 star S2 star

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,530
S3 star, so on and so forth as N star that

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,110
is a strategy that each of the N players has chosen.

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,880
>> Is in a Nash equilibrium if and only if for each one of those strategies

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,990
chosen by the n players it is the strategy

16
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,960
that maximizes the utility for that particular player, it

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,150
is the strategy that maximize the utility for that

18
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,300
particular player Given all the other strategies that were

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,670
chosen. Now I actually find that difficult to kind

20
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,950
of work through, so let me try to say

21
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,720
it a different way. Given that you have a

22
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,120
set of strategies as one star, as two star,

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,850
as three star, as n star. We know that they

24
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,170
are in Nash equilibrium, if and only if. If you randomly

25
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,230
chose one of the players, and gave them the chance to

26
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,780
switch their strategy, they would have no reason to do it.

27
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,360
>> Interesting, okay.

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,510
>> So does that make sense?

29
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,130
>> Yeah.

30
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,290
>> Right. So an equilibrium right, just in general, the word, the word sort

31
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,850
of makes sense, right, an equilibrium is

32
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,439
at a place where everything is balanced.

33
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,920
And in some sense, there's no reason

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,550
for anything to move because they're in balance.

35
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:54,650
So we set that a set of strategies are a Nash Equilibrium if no one person

36
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,940
has any reason to change their strategy

37
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,890
in a world where everyone else's strategy remains

38
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,490
the same. Then you're, then you're in equilibrium,

39
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,270
and in particular you're in a Nash equilibrium.

40
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,650
>> Nash equilibrium. Okay good.

41
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,050
>> Do you know who Nash is?

42
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,770
>> Ogden Nash was a poet.

43
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,508
>> Not that Nash.

44
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:13,660
>> I think there was a TV series with a Nash in it.

45
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,690
>> Yes there was.

46
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,120
>> But you're thinking of John Nash.

47
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,550
>> That's right The Nobel Prize winning person who

48
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,320
was the, was featured in the movie A Beautiful Mind.

49
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,260
>> Yep, that's exactly right. And it

50
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,140
was, in fact, a Beautiful Equilibrium. Okay,

51
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,690
so, there's the notion of a Nash Equilibrium. It was admitted by John Nash,

52
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,870
if you believe the movie, in order to pick up women. Which

53
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,880
I, you know, you know I never, I've never seen this movie.

54
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,850
>> Oh really? Oh, I watched it and it was, it was

55
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,640
surprising how unhelpful it was in explaining what a Nash Equilibrium was.

56
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,140
>> [LAUGH] I'm not surprised. I hope this is helpful, though. So,

57
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,060
it really is a kind of difficult concept to completely wrap your, your

58
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,070
mind around, but what it really boils down to is, listen, if

59
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,710
we all picked a bunch of strategies and we knew that one other

60
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,500
person, one of us, we don't know who before hand, but we know

61
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,570
that one of us Would have the opportunity to change their strategy after they

62
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,310
see what everyone else's strategy is. We'd be in a nash equilibrium only

63
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,850
if that person, whoever that person is, has no reason to change their strategy.

64
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,010
>> Gotcha. So, so specifically you've made a distinction

65
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,670
between strategies that were pure and strategies that were mixed.

66
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,030
>> Right.

67
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,970
>> And I guess I don't see in this case which kind we're talking about.

68
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,630
>> Right. So,

69
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,302
in this particular case, we're talking about. Pure

70
00:03:27,302 --> 00:03:32,000
strategies; however, exactly this wording works with mixed strategies.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,490
>> Oh, I see. So you could have

72
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,250
a pure Nash equilibrium or a mixed Nash equilibrium.

73
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,810
>> Right. And so, you could, each one of these, instead

74
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,790
of choosing a particular strategy and saying they're a Nash equilibrium, you

75
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,070
could talk about a probability dristribution over each of these sets of

76
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,630
strategies and say those are Nash equilibrium if. No one would want

77
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,090
to change their probability distribution.

78
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:51,900
>> Got it.

79
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,190
>> So this works for both pure and

80
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,994
mixed. Alright, so you think you understand this?

81
00:03:56,994 --> 00:04:00,050
>> [LAUGH] sure.

82
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,650
>> Good, we will test that.
