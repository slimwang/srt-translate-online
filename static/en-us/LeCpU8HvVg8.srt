00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,900
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,600
Now it's time to start
making some figures.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,230
In this lesson, I'll teach you how
to use software called Tableau

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,405
to create your visualizations.

5
00:00:09,598 --> 00:00:13,930
Tableau makes it simple to import data
from Excel, a text file, a database and

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,380
many other sources.

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,520
Then you can easily build
interactive dashboards.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,510
Unlike software such as matplotlib or

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,560
d3, you don't need to know how to
program to make awesome plots.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,142
First, let's hear more
from a Tableau pro.

11
00:00:28,142 --> 00:00:34,549
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm here with Trina Chiasson,
she is a product manager at Tableau.

12
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:37,555
And today she's going to talk to us
about Tableau and give us some demos.

13
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:39,210
So, first, before we start,

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,510
can you tell us a little bit
about your experience at Tableau?

15
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,358
&gt;&gt; Sure, and thanks for having me.

16
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:46,970
I've been with Tableau for
about a year now,

17
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,820
just over a year, and
I'm a product manager with Tableau.

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,086
I focus on innovation at the company,
which means that I get to work with

19
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:57,493
a lot of different people
across the organization.

20
00:00:57,493 --> 00:01:01,594
And I came to Tableau from a data
analysis background, as well.

21
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:07,520
&gt;&gt; Awesome, cool, so Tableau is software
for creating data visualizations.

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,950
So say I already have my data in Excel,
and I can make visualizations in Excel,

23
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,880
so what is it about Tableau
that is better than Excel?

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,500
Why do I want to use Tableau?

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.

26
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,760
Excel is an amazing product,
it's been around for a very long time.

27
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,520
Actually, it first hit the market,
the first version, in 1985.

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,040
So it's kind of hard for

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,920
us to collectively remember what
data analysis was like 30 years ago.

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,617
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

31
00:01:33,617 --> 00:01:35,759
&gt;&gt; But
it's come a long way since then, and

32
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,270
Excel has improved dramatically, too.

33
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,190
But Excel is fundamentally designed
as a spreadsheet application for

34
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,970
holding your data and
doing advanced calculations.

35
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:51,350
Tableau is designed as an exploratory
tool, a way to quickly see and

36
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:56,940
understand your data, and do analysis
and really move things around,

37
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,270
change things, iterate and
ask deep questions of your data
