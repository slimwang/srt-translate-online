00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,354
To figure out how to get rid of the fraction over here, let's focus on that term

2
00:00:04,366 --> 00:00:08,417
itself, 2 3rd x. I know that 2 3rd x is exactly the same as 2x divided by 3. So,

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,807
it would be super convenient if I could just multiply this term by 3, since then

4
00:00:12,818 --> 00:00:17,075
it would no longer be written as a fraction, and I wouldn't have to go through

5
00:00:17,087 --> 00:00:21,258
this whole mess over here. I can't, however, just multiply this term by 3. I

6
00:00:21,344 --> 00:00:25,634
need to multiply this entire side of the equation by 3. If I'm going to put in

7
00:00:25,646 --> 00:00:29,816
anything from the outside into an equation, I need to do that to the entire

8
00:00:29,828 --> 00:00:33,862
side, and I need to do it to both sides. So, I'm going to multiply everything,

9
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:38,305
both sides of the equation by 3. And it leaves us with a very pretty equation

10
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:41,648
that only has integer, coefficients, and constants.

11
00:00:41,654 --> 00:00:45,487
From here, solving is pretty straightforward. You can take a second to look at

12
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:49,170
the steps that I did to come up with the same answer as we did using the first

13
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:52,750
method, 36 over 5. Both of these are completely fine ways of solving this

14
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:56,461
problem. It's just a matter of what you prefer doing. Which kind of math you

15
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,278
enjoy doing more.
