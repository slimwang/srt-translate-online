1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,280
And here's an example of it being run in a color image.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,029
What you should see here is that there's this color board in a dark shadow.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,680
Okay? And here's the same color board in bright sunlight.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,290
Right?

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:18,430
And the idea is that in the image, if you actually measured the intensity coming

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:23,450
off of this white square, and the intensity coming off of that black square,

7
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:28,260
you would actually see the values of 119 in both places.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,440
So objectively, those two are the same value.

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,070
But of course, you and I both say that this is white and

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,490
this is black, even though they have the same value coming to our eye.

11
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,730
Because clearly what's going on is we're saying, oh that's in shadows, so

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,520
I, I recalibrate that.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,070
Well when you run that retinex algorithm that I just showed you,

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,810
and by the way, running it in two dimensions is a little bit trickier than

15
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,300
running it in one dimension.

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,340
That it says that this thing has a value of some random number 126.

17
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:01,510
This thing has a value of 175, so it is figured out, that the white square is

18
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,910
brighter than the black square, even though in the darkness, the light square's

19
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,320
going to have the same amount of light as the black square in the sunlight.

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,510
Another way of thinking about this is if you take a piece of coal, black coal,

21
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,890
outdoors in the sunlight, and

22
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,690
you look at it, more light is going to be hitting your eye,

23
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,970
coming from that black coal than a white piece of paper, inside your classroom.

24
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:22,660
Okay?

25
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,440
And yet the white piece of paper looks white and the black coal looks black.

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,440
And that's because your brain is computing for

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,430
all the stuff that's going on around it.

28
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,930
And this, this constancy, and lightness constancy,

29
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,880
we'll talk about it in just a second, is it's just remarkable.
