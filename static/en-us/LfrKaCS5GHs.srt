00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,190
Congratulations on making it this far.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,920
Think about how many new tools you
have in your developer toolbox for

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,700
building better apps.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,270
You've learned how to add
maps to your application and

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,060
configure them for
lots of different map types.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,080
You've also learned about how you can
add value to those maps,by understanding

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,840
how to move to different places,
add markers to locations of interest,

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,300
customize those markers and
draw on the surface of the map.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,570
Using lines and shapes and circles.

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,050
You're well on your way
to mastering mapping.

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,190
For the next section, you're going
to go even deeper than a map.

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,640
And take the user right
down to street level,

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,840
using Google street view technology.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,050
So, let's buckle up and go.
