1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,170
So, what else do we want to make a report on?

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:08,580
>> I think it would be nice to, as a way of

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,950
gauging in the future how many V.I.P verse general admission tickets to sell.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,180
>> That we sold over time?

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,410
>> Well, keeping track of that, so that you know maybe

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,940
for a concert in a year from now. I'll be able

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,710
to say historically this many people buy VIP and I'll be

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,440
able to sort of, you know, allocate the space appropriately or

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,070
something like that.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,700
>> Okay.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,040
>> So yeah, tickets over time.

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,340
>> Yeah, so that's a really similar chart to what we've already made. So we

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,660
can actually just keep using the same report and then save as at the end

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,080
>> Okay.

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,920
>> to have a completely different report. Cool.

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,960
>> So we have our grouping here already by ticket

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,990
type. But the other thing that it sounded like was really

18
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,470
important was the over time thing. And so, we have

19
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,560
that one field. What's that one field that we have on?

20
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,480
>> Purchase date, I think?

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,850
>> Purchase date, exactly. Yeah, so, we'll

22
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,760
want to group by purchase date also. And

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,040
so we can create another grouping. That

24
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,690
we can drag straight into our summary report.

25
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:04,744
>> Cool. Okay so let's go down to Attendee > Purchase Date.

26
00:01:04,744 --> 00:01:05,950
>> Well let's think about this really quick before

27
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,750
dragging it in. Do you think that you'd want

28
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,940
to group by purchase date first? Or do you

29
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,990
think you'd want to group by the ticket type first?
