00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,584
We're really fortunate to have our language abilities. Because of language,

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:07,816
humans are able to think and discuss abstract ideas. This is different from

3
00:00:07,816 --> 00:00:12,330
other animals who communicate with each other. But they can only do so by

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,894
signaling other members of their species about immediate situations, such as

5
00:00:15,894 --> 00:00:21,460
being hungry, hurt, or ready to reproduce. Such as using mating dances or

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,742
mating songs from birds. As we saw in lesson three, humans have evolved and our

7
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:30,593
brains grown larger, and as a result, we've been able to develop language. Our

8
00:00:30,593 --> 00:00:35,557
ancestors, homo neanderthalensis, had a very primitive language, which we call

9
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:41,067
a protolanguage. So protolanguage is a rudimentary language, also known as

10
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:46,841
pre-language, and it was used by earlier species of homo. Now as we evolved our

11
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:51,566
brain size increased. So did our ability to develop and use language. Both

12
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:55,854
psychologists and anthropologists have suggested, that the complexity of the

13
00:00:55,854 --> 00:01:01,402
brain and our ability to use language coevolved, which makes sense. With this

14
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:05,178
increase in brain size We would be able to think and communicate more complex

15
00:01:05,178 --> 00:01:10,610
and abstract ideas. Furthermore, as the size of social groups increased, so did

16
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,984
our need to be able to communicate effectively with others. Our ability to

17
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:19,340
communicate allowed us to form communities. To hunt together, protect each

18
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,590
other, and even develop the ability to cultivate land.
