You'll sometimes run into textures being flipped top to bottom, with the y axis

2
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:08,025
reversed. In 3js, you can correct this by setting the flip y parameter on your

3
00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:13,520
texture. The texture coordinates are a bit trickier when the texture's flipped.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,426
Say our image is 512 by 512 pixels in size, with the upper left hand corner of

5
00:00:17,426 --> 00:00:22,460
this texture being 0, 0. This is different than how U,V gets defined which use

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,242
the lower left hand corner as 0, 0. Also recall that each of the U,V

7
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:30,159
coordinates point at the outer edge of the image, not the texel center. The

8
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:34,965
question to you is what Texel corresponds to U,V coordinates 0.2, 0.7? What I

9
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:39,298
want here are two integers, not floating point numbers. Each Texel has a

10
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:42,148
location in an array. I want this location.
