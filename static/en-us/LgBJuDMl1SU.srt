A worm's spread on the internet has

00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,780
the following life cycle. First, the infected machine

00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,660
might scan other machines on the internet

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,980
to discover vulnerable hosts and subsequently infect the

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,000
vulnerable machines that it discovers via remote

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,010
exploit. Let's take a look at a couple

of well known early worms and how they spread, as well as how one might design

00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,280
a super fast spreading worm.
