Psychologists have looked in the all different types of problem solving.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,900
They've learned a thing or two about what helps and what hinders us in our

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,790
ability to solve problems. Now, before we get started in problem solving, I

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,830
want you to try this. Now, imagine you're in a room, and there's two strings

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:20,301
hanging from the ceiling. You can reach each string individually. But, the

6
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:25,816
strings are too far apart for you to reach them both at the same time. What's

7
00:00:25,816 --> 00:00:31,790
also in the room is a set of pliers, like these. Now, if you had to connect

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,916
these 2 strings together, how would you do it.
