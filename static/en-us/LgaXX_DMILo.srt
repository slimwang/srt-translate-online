00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,065
Sometimes, using a library
is the right answer.

2
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:07,330
While they can hide
implementation details,

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:12,140
they make complex scenarios much
easier to deal with and can soften

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,798
some of the sharp edges compared
to hand-rolling your own solution.

5
00:00:16,798 --> 00:00:22,293
Service Worker Precache is a node
module for auto-magically generating

6
00:00:22,293 --> 00:00:27,000
a service worker that will
precache your AppShell resources.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,640
By adding a few extra configuration
parameters, you can also define

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,640
runtime caching options,
perfect for our application data.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,950
The module is designed for
use with Gulp or

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,870
Grunt build scripts, though it also
provides a command line interface.

11
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,440
The module's API provides a method for
creating a service worker and

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,408
saving the resulting code to a file.

13
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:56,270
The advantage of including
it in your build script

14
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:00,140
is that it can automatically run,
whenever a file changes.

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,250
You don't need to manually
update it every time.
