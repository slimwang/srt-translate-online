00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,110
>> So, Greg, I was looking at neuroplasticity, and how learning physical changes

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,464
our brain. And I was trying to find a really good example of that, and then I

3
00:00:07,464 --> 00:00:11,360
came across the example you used in your book about London cab drivers. Can you

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,661
give us a little bit about that setting?

5
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:16,634
>> Sure. Sure. I'd be glad to. So, yeah, neuroscientists decided to study this one

6
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:21,570
group that really is intensively involved in learning. They can't use any other

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,656
map. They can't use a physical map, they can't use GPS so, you really, truly

8
00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:31,260
have to learn this very complicated network of streets. And, it takes months

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,398
and months. And they have to pass a very difficult exam. And then, for a

10
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:39,308
comparison group, they chose another group that did a lot of driving. So, they

11
00:00:39,308 --> 00:00:42,906
didn't want to explain any differences by driving alone. So they pick bus

12
00:00:42,906 --> 00:00:45,299
drivers. Now, the thing about bus driver is that they don't really have to

13
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:50,038
learn a whole lot. They take the same route every day and so on. So, when they

14
00:00:50,038 --> 00:00:53,206
look at the hippocampus of these two groups, brain region involved in learning

15
00:00:53,206 --> 00:00:58,190
and memory. The hippocampus of the cab drivers was a lot more complex and rich,

16
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:04,295
and bigger actually, then the bus drivers. So, this is just another great

17
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:08,020
example then, of how learning really does change the brain.

18
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,376
>> I'm really glad that you mentioned the hippocampus and learning because we're

19
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:13,659
actually going to go into talking about the brain structures now. So, thank you

20
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:15,080
a lot for giving us that example.
