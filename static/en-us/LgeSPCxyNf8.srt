1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,969
Let's talk about how you might make an image.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:07,290
So, here's an idea, let's just take a piece of film, or

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,150
a sensor, and, let's just expose it to the light.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,940
Do we get a reasonable picture, well, and

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,520
the fact that the title says image formation, bad method should give it away.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,790
Well, this point on top of this cartoon pine tree,

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,210
well it projects, a ray of light to some point on the film.

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,970
But of course [COUGH] it also projects a ray of light all over the film.

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,310
Likewise, another point projects all over the film.

10
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,710
So, one of the problems is that every location on the film is seeing light from

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,480
all sorts of different places, there's no single, value of light that would,

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,480
that comes from a single place in the world.

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,200
So how might we fix that?

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,810
Well, here's an easy way.

15
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,960
Let's put in a barrier, a barrier with a very small hole in it.

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,150
So here we have this little, a hole, and it's called an aperture.

17
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,500
Okay. And we're going to use the word aperture to mean a couple of different

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,680
things, but generally aperture is a small hole, that let's light in it,

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,280
you might change the size.

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,770
But here we have an aperture, and what that aperture makes is that each area on

21
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,110
the film plane or on your sensor plane is seeing light from only one,

22
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,290
point on the object, so it is showing you

23
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,660
the light that just came from one place in the world, which is what we're after.

24
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,830
By the way, something to note here, and we're going to see this a lot more,

25
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:26,640
is that the image over here on the film is inverted from what's on the object.

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,890
So the pine tree would be upside down, if you will.
