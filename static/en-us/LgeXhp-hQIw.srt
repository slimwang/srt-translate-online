All right, so as I said there can't be a one. There can't be a two because a and g aren't connected.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In fact, the shortest path has four nodes on it--one, two, three four.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So four is definitely possible. What about five--one, two, three, four, five. There's one.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What about six? So six of the nodes--one, two, three, four, five, six

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and finally, we can do a path that you saw the nodes.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A simple path that you saw the nodes. So no repeated nodes and we go from a to g.
