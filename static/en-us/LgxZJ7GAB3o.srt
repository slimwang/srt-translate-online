1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer is now simple. It's this one over here.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This one, this one, and this one.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And the reason is, the line separating both clusters runs around here.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That means all the area over here is C2 territory, and the area over here is C1 territory.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Obvioulsy as we now iterate k-means, these clusters that have been moved straight over

6
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
here will be able to stay, whereas C2 will end up somewhere over here.
