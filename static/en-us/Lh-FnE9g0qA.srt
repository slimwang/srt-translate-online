Since you just calculated the midpoints of each of the sides of this

2
00:00:03,697 --> 00:00:07,875
quadrilateral, I've now plotted them for you on our coordinate plane. I think

3
00:00:07,887 --> 00:00:12,220
you'll find something pretty interesting though. What happens if I connect all

4
00:00:12,232 --> 00:00:16,435
these midpoints together? Hm, we get 8 different quadrilateral. Think for a

5
00:00:16,447 --> 00:00:20,876
second about these line segments joining these points and the shape that we

6
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:25,875
formed. Here's a box for you to just record your thoughts about our new shape.
