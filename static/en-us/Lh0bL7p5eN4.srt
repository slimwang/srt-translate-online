Before I get started I want you to smile. Are you smiling? Okay, keep smiling.

Many researchers have found the benefits of the facial feedback effect. For

3
00:00:09,194 --> 00:00:12,314
example, one group of researchers that did an experiment similar to the one we

4
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:15,386
just did with the pen in making people smile, found that participants who had

5
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:20,647
the pen in their teeth forcing them to smile. Found a cartoon to be more

6
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:25,122
amusing, than participants who are frowning. I find this research to truly be

7
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:29,036
amazing, and can actually benefit you in your everyday life. Because our face

8
00:00:29,036 --> 00:00:33,154
is so much more than just a tool to express emotion. It can actually encourage

9
00:00:33,154 --> 00:00:38,273
and promote feelings. For example, one group of researchers found that patients

10
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:42,035
reported feeling better after receiving Botox injections in their eyebrow to

11
00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:47,115
paralyze the frowning muscles. After only two months, nine out of ten patients

12
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:51,859
said that they were no longer depressed and felt better. This stuff is truly

13
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:52,700
amazing.
