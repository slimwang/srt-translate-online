00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,790
This introduces us to the need for
parcel order planning.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,159
Parcel order planning occurs
with the multiple goals.

3
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:10,852
And the plan for
achieving one goal provost another goal.

4
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:14,060
David, can you think of an example
of parcel order planning?

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,710
>> So actually I do have a kind of
funny example of parcel order planning.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,370
Not long ago, we bought a couch.

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,110
And to keep things simple, we decided to
pay them to assemble the couch for us.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,860
Then we got the couch home and found
out that once the couch was already

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,895
assembled, it would not fit
through the apartment door.

10
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:28,650
>> [LAUGH]
>> So we had to completely disassemble

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,140
the couch, move the pieces in one by
one, and then reassemble the couch.

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:32,800
So the plan for

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,220
assembling the couch clobbered the goal
of getting the couch into the apartment.

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,720
>> Good example.

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,160
Next we will discuss how
partial order planning

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,037
can help us detect conflicts
like this and avoid them.
