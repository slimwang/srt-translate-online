00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,540
Before we go and optimize it's important
to understand that these optimizations

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,620
are only meant for production.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,580
Sure you could execute them all
the time, but it would dramatically slow

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,530
down your iterative build time, and thus
make live editing a lot less powerful.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,010
Instead I recommend to split your
tasks into development and production.

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,880
Development tasks contain things
you really need no matter what.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,390
Sass processing, for example, and tasks
that only make sense through encoding,

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,480
for instance, live editing.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,310
However, keep in mind
that while developing,

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,790
this means you'll be using a different
version of your app than your users.

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,310
It's going to look and feel mostly the
same, but sometimes performance issues

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,660
or bugs only manifest with
a specific optimization technique.

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,301
So make sure to always test the
production version from time to time.

14
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:48,030
In our next couple of instructions,
we'll be creating more generated assets.

15
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,860
Previously, the only generated files
we were producing were the CSS files.

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,360
But now we need to create
a structure to hold production and

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,760
development files separately.
