Here is a section of the Berlin wall photographed from two different angles.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,430
I've marked some candidate regions in both images.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,130
Select the ones that you think can serve as good features.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,400
Note that when evaluating the fitness of an image region you're

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,320
only considering the pixels within it.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,980
Let me get you started.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,760
This grey patch at the bottom left is pretty bad.

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,820
This nose in the right image is fairly distinguishable.
