1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,856
You might not have chosen all these answers, which is totally okay. I think all

2
00:00:03,868 --> 00:00:07,662
of these are great, and here's why. We know successful students make mistakes.

3
00:00:07,753 --> 00:00:11,713
More importantly successful students learn from their mistakes. In this course

4
00:00:11,725 --> 00:00:15,568
even if you don't get a problem right on the first time, you should definitely

5
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:19,209
try again. If you try the problem again, you're likely to get the correct

6
00:00:19,221 --> 00:00:23,364
answer. >> Then, you can also go back and write yourself a note to remember what

7
00:00:23,376 --> 00:00:27,078
went wrong. The thing that I want to emphasize, is that mistakes are okay. You

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,844
might even find some mistakes that we made while making the videos. While we try

9
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:34,482
to bring you the best material, we aren't perfect. In the first unit, you'll

10
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:38,095
even see my own handwriting and my drawings improve. I made a ton of mistakes

11
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:41,759
while making these videos, but for me, the most important part was to reflect

12
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:45,159
and learn from those mistakes. To be successful in this course, we also

13
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:48,677
recommend you take notes while watching the videos. These notes can be helpful

14
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:52,293
for you to solve practice problems, and also help you review content later. It's

15
00:00:52,305 --> 00:00:55,790
a great idea to break up your notes into individual lessons. That way, you can

16
00:00:55,802 --> 00:00:59,890
remember what you learned from each video segment. Third, research tell us that

17
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:04,660
the most learning occurs while working in groups. Students don't succeed just by

18
00:01:04,672 --> 00:01:09,130
working harder or studying longer. They do better by talking about that. By

19
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:13,950
discussing it, by practicing it, and teaching others. Usually from lecture, you

20
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:18,535
only remember 5% of what you hear. From reading, you only remember 10%. Audio

21
00:01:18,547 --> 00:01:22,855
and visual 20, and demonstrations 30%. These are considered to be passive ways

22
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:26,505
of learning because they don't rely on much from you to, well, learn. When you

23
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:30,130
participate on the forms, or complete practice problems after videos, you're

24
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:33,805
becoming an active learner. These are the best things you can do throughout the

25
00:01:33,817 --> 00:01:37,405
course to help yourself learn. And if you're really mastered something, that

26
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:41,610
means you can teach anyone. That's the best. Fina lly, if you're half listening

27
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:45,865
or losing focus, just stop. Take a break and come back and try again. You want

28
00:01:45,877 --> 00:01:50,030
to avoid guessing through the quizzes or trying to rush through the material.

29
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:54,245
One thing we know about learning is that there's an actual physical need for

30
00:01:54,257 --> 00:01:58,836
time to process new material. So give each question your full attention and your

31
00:01:58,848 --> 00:02:03,130
thoughts. Congratulations on completing your first question. We hope you have a

32
00:02:03,142 --> 00:02:07,383
better idea about how to succeed in this course. When you're ready, come join us

33
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:08,502
in visualize algebra.
