00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,730
Alright, so I want to make a pie chart showing the distribution of musical

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,590
genres, so I made a new report on bands, and I added this genre column.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,170
>> Right.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,610
>> I'm going to have to make it a summary.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,240
>> Yep.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,660
>> And I want to group by genre, right? Oh, okay, I didn't mean to do that.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,700
>> It's okay.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,130
>> It's okay. And you will probably want to

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,180
show, I'm mean if this were a real report.

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,985
Other fields about the bands that are playing. I would assume.

11
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:28,825
>> Okay.

12
00:00:28,825 --> 00:00:30,860
>> So drag a few of those guys in there too.

13
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,078
>> So I'm going to add my chart. going to make

14
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:37,720
it a pie chart. Values will be record count.

15
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:37,980
>> Yep

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,720
>> The wedges will be genre.

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,884
>> Just knows.

18
00:00:40,884 --> 00:00:41,620
>> This is really good.

19
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,690
>> Oh, and then they will hover and

20
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,390
you said you wanted to show percentages, right?

21
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:45,890
>> Yeah.

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,280
Very cool. And then I'm just going to run the report, or save

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,370
it first to run the report and then add it to my dashboard.

24
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,020
>> Sounds good.

25
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,220
>> And Sam, I'm sorry, but it looks like we're only going

26
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,140
to have 6% of the bands at our festival will be Bossa Nova.

27
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,446
>> That sounds about right.

28
00:01:03,446 --> 00:01:04,571
[LAUGH]

29
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:08,440
>> 30% rock, 20% electronic quite a bit

30
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,370
of reggae and even 14% salsa. Pretty cool.
