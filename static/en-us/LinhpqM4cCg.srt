1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,460
So this works for things other than words. The place where

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,110
you've seen it the most so far has been in language,

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,689
but we're also going to to see how to use it to

4
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:10,550
make procedures. And you'll also see how to use it in

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,800
later classes, how to define data structures. There are lots and

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,780
lots of different things in computing that are defined recursively. And

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,660
a recursive definition has two parts. It has the base case.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,660
In our example with the word, that was the second rule.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,360
And the base case we can think of as

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,330
a starting point. And the important thing about the base

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,820
case, is it's not defined in terms of itself. It

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,400
has to be something where we already know how to

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,260
define it. So for programs, it's usually going to be the

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,540
smallest input, or one of the simplest inputs. Something where

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,280
we already know the answer. We don't have to do

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,900
any computation to figure it out. The second part is

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,240
the recursive case. And that is defined in terms of itself.

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,570
[BLANK_AUDIO]

19
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,310
But it shouldn't be defined in terms of

20
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,660
itself exactly. It should be defined in terms of

21
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,880
some sort of smaller version of itself. We need

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,040
to make progress to eventually get to the base

23
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,360
case. We'll see what that means in programs

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,280
soon. First, we're going to try one other example not

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,370
in terms of a program, just to get a

26
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,050
better sense for how things can be defined recursively.
