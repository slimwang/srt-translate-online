1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,360
Because the length of hash is 128 bits.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,050
That means there are 128
possible hash values.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,710
Using the birthday paradox,

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,529
the attacker needs to search
a square root of 2 to the 128th,

5
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:19,090
that many possible messages in order
to find two that share the same hash.

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,469
Therefore, the answer is 2 to 64.
