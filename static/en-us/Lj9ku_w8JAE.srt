[Thrun] This question is about naive Bayes and Laplacian smoothing.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Our training data is a set of movie titles: A Perfect World,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
My Perfect Woman, and Pretty Woman.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We also have a song class of song titles: A Perfect Day, Electric Storm,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Another Rainy Day.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Suppose we get a new title, the query Perfect Storm,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and we wish to know whether Perfect Storm is more likely a movie or a song.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Compute for me the following model probabilities:

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
the probability for movie class and song class,

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
the probability of the word "perfect" conditioned on the movie class,

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the probability of the word "perfect" conditioned on the song class,

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and the same for the word "storm."

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Please use Laplacian smoothing for this with K equals 1.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Don't compute the maximum likelihood estimate.
