00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,640
The Nexus One has a 3.7 inch screen,
and the Nexus 5, a 4.9 inch display,

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,704
so they both fall comfortably within
the normal range for screen size.

00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:14,383
The Nexus One has a screen density
of 252 dpi, which is hdpi,

4
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:18,213
whereas the Nexus 5, which was released
three years after the Nexus One,

5
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:22,362
has a much higher screen
density, 445 dots per inch.

6
00:00:22,744 --> 00:00:25,220
That makes it xxhdpi.
