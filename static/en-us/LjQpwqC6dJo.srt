Here's the answer. I've just modified the code in the finally block and we added

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,874
a new try around it. So, now we're going to, instead of just doing fout.close,

3
00:00:08,874 --> 00:00:13,210
we're going to try fout.close. If it fails, we're going to catch all exceptions

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,565
and we'll do nothing, that's what pass does. So, now if fout is not defined,

5
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:21,981
well there's no file to close, that will raise an exception, but we can ignore

6
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,519
that. Otherwise, it'll close the file.
