1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,243
So I'm going to start by taking my total amount of money and splitting it into

2
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:08,328
fifths. Notice that 1 whole circle is 5 5ths. I'm going to save 2 5ths of my

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,621
money, so let's show that on a another circle. And I'm going to save 2 5ths of

4
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:16,853
my total money. I don't know how much total money I have but I know I'm saving

5
00:00:16,865 --> 00:00:18,217
this fraction. Money.

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,595
I'm trying to figure out what fraction I have left that I can still spend.

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,361
Visually, I can see that I still have 3 5ths of my money to spend. So how did I

8
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:32,058
get that? I did 5 5ths, that was the whole amount of money I had, and I need to

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,639
subtract off 2 5ths. So I have 5 5ths minus 2 5ths. So I'm taking away 2 5ths

10
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:41,645
from my 5 5ths. So I just need to subtract the numerators. So 5 5th's take away

11
00:00:41,657 --> 00:00:46,670
2 5th's leaves me with 3 5th's. I work with subtracting just like I do with

12
00:00:46,682 --> 00:00:52,095
adding fractions. I only change the numerators, all I'm doing is taking my 5th's

13
00:00:52,107 --> 00:00:57,120
and taking out two of them, leaving me with 3 5th's. If you got 3 5th's, nice

14
00:00:57,132 --> 00:01:01,561
work. Whether you know it or not, you've already started thinking algebraically.

15
00:01:01,655 --> 00:01:05,627
I have no idea how much money you can earn in a month but we've let that amount

16
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:09,814
represent this circle. It was an abstract form of reasoning. We knew that if you

17
00:01:09,826 --> 00:01:13,912
saved 2 5ths of it that you would have 3 5ths of it left to spend on whatever

18
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:17,742
you please. So, even though I don't know the total amount of money, I can still

19
00:01:17,754 --> 00:01:21,216
say at least what fraction of that money can be spent. One of the key skills in

20
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:24,736
algebra is to find ways to work with unknown amounts or numbers. We'll see this

21
00:01:24,748 --> 00:01:26,036
throughout the entire course.
