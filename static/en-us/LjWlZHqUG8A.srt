00:00:00,074 --> 00:00:04,943
Conceptually map and transpose are 1-to-1. Each input maps to a single unique output.

2
00:00:04,943 --> 00:00:10,143
You can think of a gather operation as many-to-1. Many possible inputs can be chosen to compute an output.

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,845
In this terminology, scatter is 1-to-many,

4
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:16,373
so each thread chooses from many possible output destinations.

5
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:21,191
Stencil can be seen as a specialized gather that pulls output from a select few inputs

6
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:25,188
in a given neighborhood of the output. So you might turn that to several-to-1.

7
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:29,534
In the next lecture John will tell you about 2 more really fundamental patterns.

8
00:00:29,534 --> 00:00:34,269
Reduce could be turned all-to-one. For example if you're adding up all the numbers in an array.

9
00:00:34,269 --> 00:00:37,297
Finally scan and sort can be considered all-to-all because

10
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:40,456
all of the input can affect the destination of the resulting output.

11
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:43,286
You'll learn more about these in the next lectures.
