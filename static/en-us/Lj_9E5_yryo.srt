00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,180
The scenario here is that you're given a binary file,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,640
with arbitrary contents. And the goal, is to break it up

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,700
into pieces of some fixed size, and then shuffle those

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,500
pieces around, in some random order. So the parameters will just

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,140
be the file name and the size of the pieces.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,230
The code to do the shuffling in memory is provided. You

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,340
just need to open, close, map and unmap the file in

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,370
order to use it. Consult the bin pages and good luck.
