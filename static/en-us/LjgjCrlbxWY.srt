1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,730
Let's take another look at the whole frequency spectrum and

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,740
see how we can manipulate it and do different types of things with.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,610
So of course one way we could do is now actually basically can say is,

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:14,020
find me all frequencies in this frequency spectrum that's inside this circle,

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,730
and that would be actually some way of looking at what we want to start doing.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,410
Filtering, either, could be low-pass or anything above it.

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,530
So, of course, I can now, using this threshold on this spectrum,

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,920
look at just the frequencies that are above or below this.

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,100
I can create bounds.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,590
So I can only look for high-pass or, in there, just information within it,

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,170
or just look for information in the spectrum, just in this band here.

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,400
So that allows me to play around with just using the amplitudes and figuring out

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,750
which parts of the signal I want to actually be paying more attention to.

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,060
Of course we can take the same kinds of things for

15
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,970
phase radiations, and create bands.

16
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,030
And now I in fact just look for information of these kinds of orientations,

17
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,920
the image that are just within this or that.

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,820
And now allows me to kind of customize how I do processing,

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,610
on which frequency bands or

20
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,840
which orientation bands I want to be actually extracting information out of.

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,570
So that allows us to basically change the spectrum and

22
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,870
also reconstruct this on the kinds of information we're specifically looking at.

23
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,290
And again, one of the things we want to look at is,

24
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,090
which sometimes in a signal I may want to pay attention only to core signal.

25
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,940
Sometimes I may be interested looking at the finer signal.

26
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,350
And of course using that,

27
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,690
I can customize my processing to get the right kinds of information out.
