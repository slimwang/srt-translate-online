00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,202
Now that we've fixed a few problems
in the Udacity student data,

2
00:00:03,202 --> 00:00:06,560
and started to uncover some
relationships between the variables,

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,650
it's time to move on to drawing
conclusions, or making predictions.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,410
You've probably already started to
draw some tentative conclusions.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,870
For example, that students who pass
the subway project spend more minutes in

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,120
the classroom during their first
week than students who don't.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,910
However, even if there was no real
difference between students who passed

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,805
their project than students who didn't,

9
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:30,035
you wouldn't expect the two
means to be exactly equal.

10
00:00:30,035 --> 00:00:32,805
How can you tell the difference
you saw is a true difference or

11
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:34,265
if it's due to noise in the data?

12
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,675
The differences we saw
looked pretty large so

13
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:40,625
it may be hard to imagine this
could be due to noise but

14
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,145
intuition does not always work
very well in these situations.

15
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,780
To rigorously check how likely it would
be to see these results by random

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,320
chance, you need to use statistics.

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,780
To learn more about how to do this,

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,540
check out Udacity statistics course
linked in the instructor notes.

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,910
For now we're not going to go further in
this direction since statistics isn't

20
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,220
required to take this course, but

21
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,260
keep in mind that the results
we have are only tentative.

22
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,310
They haven't been validated.
