1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,750
Now I will turn things over to 3.8 to lead the attack against these bugs.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,850
>> Is everyone ready, Crazy Bob?

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:08,880
>> I am ready, sir.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,388
>> Bite Me? >> Ready to go.

5
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:12,700
>> Ready to roll.

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,980
>> Doctor Bug? >> I was born ready.

7
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,660
>> Oh, excellent.

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,090
We are all ready here.

9
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:17,620
So, let us start.

10
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,564
>> If I could interject something before we begin [LAUGH] I just would like to

11
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:26,359
say, before we started this project, I I advised management that we wouldn't be

12
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,460
having a lot of these core problems that we've got now if we just use data.

13
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,140
We're on job aid it would really, you know,

14
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,610
it would solve a lot of our integration problems and all.

15
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,286
And I just wanted to make that clear, that I told them before we

16
00:00:38,286 --> 00:00:41,430
began this project that we should do it, and here we are looking at jobs.

17
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,380
So, I just wanted to make that clear before we got started.

18
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,220
>> Well, I mean, with that,

19
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,390
just trying to read this Baloney Code that this guy wrote is unbearable.

20
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,280
>> Well I think we should just, >> I am just sick to my stomach.

21
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,090
>> We should just proceed with the review probably.

22
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:54,640
>> Oh, well, okay.

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,155
>> Gentlemen, let me remind you that I'm the controller here.

24
00:00:57,155 --> 00:01:00,000
[LAUGH] Thank you very much for your advice.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,250
Dear reader, Doctor Bug, please talk.

26
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,769
>> We start with two imports in the code.

27
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,792
The first one is an import to the java.io package, all the classes in

28
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:14,335
the package, and there's the right semicolon right after that.

29
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:19,272
And there's another importer, which is to java.lang.System,

30
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:24,739
which is used for the io, and another semicolon, so this looks fine.

31
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:27,382
>> So line one, line one is actually not good coding style,

32
00:01:27,382 --> 00:01:30,540
because you should never import you're polluting the namespace.

33
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,010
So we should never import asterisk,

34
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,100
we should only import the classes that we're actually using.

35
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,690
>> Well, I think it's okay, all right, if we need to use multiple ones.

36
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,700
Do you want to spell them all out.

37
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,470
>> But then you're polluting,

38
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,840
you're bringing in all these names that we really don't need.

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,340
So, I think it should be, what?

40
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,591
Java. I think the only IO class, let's see InputStream.read, so

41
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:51,023
we should have java.io.InputStream.reader.

42
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:56,434
>> I think you're, you're wasting space by doing this,

43
00:01:56,434 --> 00:01:59,550
I mean this is, why is it there?

44
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,690
>> And thanks for telling us about the semicolons, that's a, a big help.

45
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,190
>> Yeah I figured.

46
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,610
>> Can I continue?

47
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,410
>> Yes, please continue.

48
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:12,800
>> So should I record that as defect or, or we don't believe that's a defect?

49
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,010
>> I think you should I, personally, I gotta,

50
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,310
I gotta echo Crazy Bob here because if we move to the next line here,

51
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,710
purpose, we have the slash star here for comment style and then further on

52
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:26,200
down we're going to use the slash slash, some consistency would be nice.

53
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,212
>> So, I think we should record that as an error.

54
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:29,367
>> But let's move on.

55
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:30,220
>> That's bad style.

56
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,030
>> Sure, sure.

57
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,315
Okay, Crazy Bob will record it.

58
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:34,079
Dr. Bug?

59
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,338
>> Okay, fine.

60
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:37,400
okay, then the main class starts, which is >> Before we do that,

61
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,510
let me complain about line 2.

62
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,132
I don't believe you have to import anything from java.lang, right?

63
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:46,027
I believe java.lang comes in automatically.

64
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:47,056
>> I believe that's correct.

65
00:02:47,056 --> 00:02:49,418
>> So that's a useless, that's a useless import.

66
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:53,380
>> Okay, fine, that's what my mentor told me that I was supposed to do but

67
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,260
that's okay.

68
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,840
>> Okay, so then we start with the main classes.

69
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,140
>> Maybe we should reconcile this common issue, before we move on.

70
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,890
As brought up by me.

71
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,560
>> I think so.

72
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,060
>> I mean.

73
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,860
That, that's just.

74
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,720
Don't you have coding standards and

75
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,500
which would include how to write comments in your, in your.

76
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,040
>> I do and it's usually, just stick with one and

77
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,400
then that's the way it goes for the rest of the, the comments.

78
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,960
>> The slash-star has so much history with it.

79
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,540
You know, we want,

80
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,440
we want to reflect the fact that this is a historical artifact.

81
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,170
>> I don't know if I agree I,

82
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,190
I think not only that, I'm not sure what constitutes getting its own white space

83
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,030
like an extra line here.

84
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,040
We move down further maybe we come back to this but

85
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,690
I have a couple places that I marked that I just don't quite understand.

86
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,367
>> Maybe Bite me is saying, let's go one down and come back to this.

87
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:40,701
Doctor, Bug please continue.

88
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:41,329
>> Thank you.
