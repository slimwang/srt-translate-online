1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
To provide a test network for looking at shortest path problems, I downloaded from the Internet

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
a social network, as it were, of marvel comic book characters.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's a lot like the IMDB data and that there's sort of people

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and they are linked together if they appear together in a sort of movie,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but in the comic book world, we're talking about something more like superhero characters

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
in which particular comic books they both appeared in.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So for example, Spiderman at least in this set here, Spiderman appeared in a comic book

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
called COC 1 and also in one called MaxSec 3 and Thor and Hulk also appeared in MaxSec 3.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So path in this network are kind of like paths in the Kevin Dating Game and that you go from

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,000
say Black Widow to COC 1 to Spiderman to MaxSec to Thor

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
cause in this set, Thor and Black Widow are not directly connected.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
No that's not true. Here's the path.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So again you can play kind of like the Kevin Dating Game except it's kind of a Spiderman game.
