00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,614
Say you're controlling a camera by using a position and target system. For each

2
00:00:03,614 --> 00:00:07,714
of these camera moves, what must change? The target or the position? Check all

3
00:00:07,714 --> 00:00:12,162
or none that apply. Select an attribute only if it's changing a fair bit, say

4
00:00:12,162 --> 00:00:15,752
more that a foot for a given attribute. For example, if I said to move your

5
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:19,510
camera so that it was pointing straight up. The target would have changed

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,565
considerably, while the position would have changed just a small bit. So if you

7
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:28,070
orbit to the right does the target or position change? Both or neither?

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:33,050
Similarly for turn camera to the left, zoom in, and pan to the right.
