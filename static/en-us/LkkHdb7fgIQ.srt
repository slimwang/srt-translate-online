1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,040
So far, so good.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,755
Except that what I just showed you won't work.

3
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:06,780
[LAUGH] And let me show you why.

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,270
So in the real world.

5
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,720
So here I have this little function, okay?

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,780
And so this is f of x, right?

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,460
And it's got some stuff, and then it takes a jump and

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,170
it's got some more stuff over there.

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,350
So that's intensity as a function of x.

10
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,080
If I actually take the gradient of that function by just doing,

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,350
say, a right difference.

12
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:24,940
All right?

13
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,680
What I'll do, I'll apply my derivative operator and I'll get this.

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,510
And one might ask, where is the edge.

15
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,830
Well, we can see here, the edge is really, whoops,

16
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,710
I missed, the edge is right there.

17
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,670
But in this mess, it's sort of hard to tell.

18
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,960
And the problem, of course, is that we've added noise.

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,570
And that noise has caused us to have positive and

20
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,690
negative derivatives all over the place.

21
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,360
So let's look a little bit more about the effect of noise on some of

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,470
our derivatives and what we might do about them, okay?

23
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,290
So, here we have again more of that striped duck,

24
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,490
and here we have the gradient image.

25
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,290
And what you can start to see is that as I add noise to the image,

26
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,580
my gradient starts to fall apart.

27
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,200
That is I'm starting to see this, I had this little bit of Gaussian noise and

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,660
now I'm turning into these big salt and pepper noise.

29
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,490
Oh it feels like salt and

30
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,780
pepper noise, just these large spikes are happening within my derivative.

31
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,810
So we have to handle that noise somehow.

32
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,010
You probably know how to handle, how do we handle noise?

33
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,360
We filter, we smooth, we get rid of it, right?

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,460
We did that before.

35
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,200
Come on, are you paying attention?

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,660
Alright, so here's my image f.

37
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,260
So now let me apply a smoothing kernel, h.

38
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,730
Okay, so I'm just going to smooth it.

39
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,820
So when I smooth it, I get this is h convolved.

40
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,780
Doesn't matter whether you do convolution or correlation.

41
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,230
H convolved with f, and you see now I get a nice, smooth function.

42
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,210
So now that we've smoothed the signal, we can take the derivative and

43
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,920
what you see is we get this nice, smooth peak.

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,540
So, where is the edge?

45
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,700
The edge is going to be at this peak right here,

46
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,840
corresponding to that edge right there.

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,970
So basically in order to find our edges, we're going to have to

48
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:08,410
basically apply smooth gradients somehow and look for some peaks.

49
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,110
Before we go ahead and

50
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,780
do that, remember this whole notion of associate property and linearity etc.

51
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,640
We can save ourselves an operation, because the derivative of h

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,400
convolved with f, is the same as the derivative of h convolved with f.

53
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,540
So what does that look like when we're doing this edge detection?

54
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,800
It's the following.

55
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,770
So here we have the same f that we had before.

56
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,570
Now, I take my h, and I take the derivative.

57
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,210
That now looks like this.

58
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,001
When I apply that function directly to f,

59
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:47,201
I get out the same value that I got out last time.

60
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:51,347
Which has to be because of the associative property of linear operators, and

61
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:55,110
derivatives and filtering being these linear operators.

62
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,980
That also saves us an operation, because we can just take this filter and

63
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,840
apply it and no more derivatives have to be done.

64
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,100
All right, so last question, okay.

65
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,820
So, we have these nice peaks.

66
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,030
We have to find the peaks.

67
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,800
We have to find the maximum of that derivative.

68
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,460
How do we find maxima?

69
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,090
We take more derivatives.

70
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,130
So we're going to have to take another derivative.

71
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,920
So now, instead of just doing a single derivative,

72
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,140
we're going to take a second derivative.

73
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,240
So, before h was just a Gaussian, this was our first derivative of a Gaussian.

74
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,680
If we take the derivative of that again we get this,

75
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,780
what's sometimes called inverted mexican hat.

76
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,080
And you'll see that, when we do it in 2D,

77
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,640
right, because it's kind of like this sombrero shape but up and down, right?

78
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,720
When we apply that operator to the image,

79
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,130
we get this nice zero crossing with this strong slope.

80
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,290
And that's what corresponds to our edge.

81
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:54,790
All right.

82
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,040
And this idea of a stong slope zero crossing.

83
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,040
We don't have to find general maxima, we just have to find any place where

84
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,425
the value is zero and that nearby has a strong gradient.
