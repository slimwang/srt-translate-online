00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,810
There are three basic checks that you
should make before releasing any app

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,100
that will cover the majority
of accessibility scenarios.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,010
First, you need to provide
content descriptions for

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,820
user interface components that
do not have visible text.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,059
This is most important for
buttons, check boxes, and

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,650
images because these components
often influence the flow of the app.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,210
So use the android:contentDescription
layout attribute or

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,480
the setContentDescription() Java
method to provide this information for

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,690
accessibility services.

10
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,840
Note however that decorative graphics
are the exception to this rule, but

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,230
be sure to indicate this by setting
content description to NULL.Second,

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,520
you should make sure that users
can navigate your screen layouts

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,060
by using the hardware based, or
software directional controls.

14
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,860
Many users will employ D-pads,
trackballs, keyboards, and

15
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,100
navigation gestures, and you should be
confident that your Apple support these.

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,070
Put an exceptional focus on ensuring
that any UIElement that accepts input

17
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,810
Is reachable.

18
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,280
In some cases, this may require that
UI components are focusable, or

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,900
else you may need to adjust
the focus order to be more logical.

20
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,240
Finally, audio feedback must always
have a secondary feedback mechanism,

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,250
to support users who are deaf or
hard of hearing.

22
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,860
For example, a sound alert for the
arrival of a message must be accompanied

23
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,500
by a system notification, haptic
feedback or some other visual queue.
