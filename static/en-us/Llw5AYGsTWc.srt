00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,138
In this lesson, we are going to continue using the lowest common denominator to

2
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:08,830
help us simplify expressions. The lowest common denominator or LCD has

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,568
tremendous power. We're going to use it again to help us simplify complex

4
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:17,685
fractions. A fraction like this one. I'll guide you through the questions you

5
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:21,615
want to ask yourself to simplify a fraction like this. To get started, we want

6
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:25,990
to find the lowest common denominator of all the internal fractions of our

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,943
complex fraction. Complex fractions, like this one, have fractions either in the

8
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:35,642
numerator or in the denominator, or in this case, both. So, let's start our path

9
00:00:35,642 --> 00:00:41,090
to try and simplify this crazy looking thing. What do you think is the LCD for

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,613
the denominators x, 4, and 8. Write your answer here.
