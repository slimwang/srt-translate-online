Now that we know that we want to discuss the distance Athena has driven and the

2
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:07,930
time she spent driving, which of the following statements makes the most sense

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,997
in the context of her story. Do you think that time spent driving and distance

4
00:00:11,997 --> 00:00:16,010
driven are not related? Do you think that time spent driving depends on distance

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,829
driven? Or, do you think that distance driven depends on time spent driving?
