1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,950
So this instruction simply gets marked done.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,150
We then broadcast the value of three under the name of ROB6,

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,300
but nobody's waiting for it. That's all that happens for writing this value.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,610
In cycle 14 we will also commit this instruction. The question for

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,550
you, which entry in the architectural register file changes, if any. Leave this

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,350
blank if none of them change, otherwise write the R1, R2, et cetera, depending

7
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:32,880
on which one changes. And if it does change, that entry becomes what value?
