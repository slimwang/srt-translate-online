00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,700
A time series that exhibits a repeating
pattern at fixed intervals of time

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:08,410
within a one year period is said to
have a seasonal pattern or seasonality.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,510
Seasonality is a common pattern seen
across many different kinds of time

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,500
series.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,880
For example, if you live in a climate
with cold Winters and warm Summers

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,550
your home's air conditioning costs
probably rise in the summer and

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,010
fall in the winter.

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,550
You would reasonably expect
the seasonality of your air conditioning

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,150
costs to recur every year.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,690
Likewise, a company that sells heavy
coats would see sales jump in the Winter

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,420
but drop in the Summer.

12
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,540
Companies that understand the seasonal
patterns of their business can time

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,440
inventories, staffing, and

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,219
other decisions that coincide with
the expected change in business.

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,568
The US postal service hiring temporary
drivers and workers during the holiday

16
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:49,340
season shows how a company adapts to
meet a change caused by seasonal demand.
