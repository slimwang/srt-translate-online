1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,040
So, user research is the umbrella name for

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,230
a wide array of techniques you can use to

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,390
just understand who your users are with the

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,870
goal being to learn to design and develop better

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,210
products. It can run from, in lab testing,

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,760
where you have head-mounted tracking equipment and all kinds

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,775
of sensors to going to field studies where you

8
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:25,780
hop on airplanes and go to all the corners

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,490
of the globe. To watching your logs, where you're getting

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,369
data from millions of users. And kind of trying to

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,330
understand what they're doing and how you can do it

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,440
better. Or you can do it much more cheaply, much more

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,510
quickly. And because every little bit that you do, to

14
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,060
kind of better understand your users is going to be tremendously

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,560
valuable to you. So you can do things like just

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,170
talking to a handful of people. But taking printouts or drawings

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,940
of what you think you're going to build and putting it

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,870
in front of people and getting their responses to it. Like

19
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,680
lots of little things can help you tease away little bits

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,270
of information about who your users are and how you can

21
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,200
better work for them. We all think we know ourselves

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,240
pretty well, so naturally if you just kind of base on

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,860
what you know about yourself and what you want, you'll build

24
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,270
a product that hopefully satisfies at least you. But you also

25
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:21,920
cover so many experiences, so many preconceptions, so many assumptions, about

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,370
what this project should be, how it should work, built on

27
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,700
everything you've gone through with other products before in your life.

28
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,060
You don't share that with all of your users and you

29
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,520
may not even share the same goals for this product with

30
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,720
your users. If you want to build something that's really successful, you

31
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,910
need to understand them, where they're coming from, where they're trying

32
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,410
to go. And then you can build a product that completes that

33
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,610
story for them. Even if time is short and you just

34
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,690
have to make a decision right now and you can't take

35
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,020
the time to go out and talk to other people, just

36
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,610
by thinking about that persona, inventing it. Takes you out of

37
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,180
your own head and starts you thinking about somebody else. So

38
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,340
it's better to kind of build for that other, even if

39
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,240
it's not based on hard data than to just bias towards

40
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,430
your own needs. This was awhile back but I was working on

41
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,979
a product for, kind of, bloggers who weren't

42
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,360
bloggers yet. Kind of non-expert bloggers to create posts

43
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,790
and start sharing things and I wasn't interested

44
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,560
in blogging as a product at all. So it

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,030
was very much that I had to kind of

46
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,290
think about users who strongly weren't me. And I

47
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,090
remember in particular there was this desire from

48
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,450
users that surprised me that they just wanted to

49
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,420
record audio for their blogs. They didn't even want to sit down and

50
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,960
write it, they want to kind of compose these things, they want to be able

51
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,698
to be out and to go and just. You speak into their phone

52
00:02:40,698 --> 00:02:43,997
and [SOUND] pop up comes the entry. It's a kind of thing that

53
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,534
I would of never thought about if I had only referred like what

54
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:49,340
I would of expected out of that product. I would of assumed, oh,

55
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,350
I want to spend time crafting this and typing this thing. But its

56
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,570
turned out to be one of the most satisfying parts of that product

57
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:00,380
for users and something that was also a differentiator between

58
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,250
other that and other products that were on the market.
