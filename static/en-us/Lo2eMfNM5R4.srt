00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:04,163
All right, great. We've completed a table full of information. We have

2
00:00:04,163 --> 00:00:08,662
information about Janet and information about Rohan. Now, there's one last

3
00:00:08,662 --> 00:00:14,150
critical piece to this motion problem. And it's right here. We know Janet and

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,160
Rohan spend the same amount of time traveling. This means Janet's time has to

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,562
equal Rohan's time. It means that we can set up an equation. So what equation

6
00:00:24,562 --> 00:00:29,110
can we write to solve for Janet's speed? Put that equation here.
