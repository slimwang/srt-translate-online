00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,317
Here's a list then of some of the possible rational zeros that we came up with

2
00:00:03,317 --> 00:00:08,636
in the last quiz. In fact this is just the positive versions. Starting at the

3
00:00:08,636 --> 00:00:11,912
top of this list and then working down, please plug in each of these values of

4
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:17,392
x into the function. And oops, I made a mistake. I accidentally wrote f of x

5
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:21,225
instead of P of x. Remember it's super important to keep the names of our

6
00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:24,312
functions straight so that we know what functions we're talking about, but

7
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:28,900
everyone makes mistakes including me. Once you've found the value of the

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:33,660
function at each of these X values please evaluate whether or not it's a zero.

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,952
If P of X does equal zero then please type O Y in the zero column, but if it

10
00:00:37,952 --> 00:00:42,945
doesn't type and N. Since some of these numbers are pretty big I'm going to

11
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:46,727
make your life a little bit easier. As soon as you type a y into the zero

12
00:00:46,727 --> 00:00:50,907
column, you can stop. We're just trying to find which x value is the first

13
00:00:50,907 --> 00:00:55,641
zero. Or at least the first zero on this list. That will be enough information

14
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:59,449
for us to continue simplifying this function, and figuring out more information

15
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:01,133
that we need.
