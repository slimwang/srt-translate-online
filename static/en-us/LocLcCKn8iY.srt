1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,930
So those of you that are old enough will remember, and

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,610
especially if you're from the United States.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,420
You'll remember that for

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,650
a while there was this whole bunch of books out there called Where's Waldo.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,990
And they would give you a scene that looked like this on the left, and

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,570
your goal was to find.

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,330
Here's Waldo right here, kind of blurred out,

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,620
hard to see, that would be my template maybe.

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,003
And I want to find Waldo.

10
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,650
And if you take a look at this, can every body see where Waldo is?

11
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,250
Well, he's right there, okay.

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,840
We go back there, okay, you can see him.

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,970
There he is, all right?

14
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,950
So, the question is, how could you do this doing the template matching?

15
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,150
Well, we would do the same thing before.

16
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,740
We take our image, we take our little template, and

17
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,670
maybe you can see over here on this Correlation map, all right?

18
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,940
There's that bright spot right there.

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,240
And you'll notice, that everywhere else it's hardly bright at all.

20
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,140
But right there, that's that bright spot.
