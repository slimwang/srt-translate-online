00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,119
So, continuing with cognitive development and Piaget stages, we're going to

2
00:00:04,119 --> 00:00:09,445
move on to childhood development. Here we the preoperational stage, this covers

3
00:00:09,445 --> 00:00:14,852
the preschool years, from about 2 to 6 depending on the person. So, what makes

4
00:00:14,852 --> 00:00:19,600
something preoperational? To answer that, we need to know what operational is.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,304
An operation is a mental ability to figure something out in ones head. It's

6
00:00:23,304 --> 00:00:27,640
like problem solving, or trying to do a math problem in your head. Well, young

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,055
children can't quite do this yet, so they're preoperational.
