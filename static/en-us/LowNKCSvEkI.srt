00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,596
No I'll show you something else that's really cool. Since we know that the

2
00:00:03,596 --> 00:00:07,750
sample statistics often aren't exactly what the population parameters are, we

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:13,206
might want a confidence interval for the true correlation. In other words, a

4
00:00:13,206 --> 00:00:17,290
range of likely values for the population correlation coefficient rho. I used

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,570
the statistical program R to calculate confidence intervals for Pearson's r,

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:28,480
using this data. For the correlation between age and time you arrive at a

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,890
party, the 95% confidence interval went from negative 0.3995, to positive

8
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:46,440
0.0914. And for age and number of pets, this ranged from 0.1369 to 0.5733.

9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,982
Based on these Confidence Intervals, what could you logically conclude? What

10
00:00:50,982 --> 00:00:53,380
would be your statistical decision for each?
