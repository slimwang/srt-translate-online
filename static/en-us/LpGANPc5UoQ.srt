1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,370
So the correct answers are the hypercube
and the fully connected network.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,560
First remember that we're assuming P=n.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,040
So for this example picture
there are 16 processes.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,930
Notice that the first eight
processes have to exchange data

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,690
with the second eight.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,190
Therefore you need a network with
a linear or better bisection width.

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:20,730
In this case,

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,290
a hypercube and fully-connected
networks are really your only options.

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,970
In fact, a fully connected
network is probably overkill,

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,970
because it has many more
links than you actually need.

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,689
A hypercube, on the other hand,
is a pretty good fit.

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:33,310
Can you see why?

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,490
Just think about how you
build hypercubes, and

14
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,960
how that compares with
the basic pattern of exchange.

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,090
By the way, there's another kind of
network topology called a butterfly

16
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,480
topology.

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,470
The butterfly network is
exactly this picture.

18
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,610
Butterfly networks remind me of
an old joke about Europeans comparing

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,100
the word butterfly in their
various native tongues.

20
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,544
What is wrong with Schmetterling?
