Nice work, now I think ordering
methods can actually be used

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,630
to solve another issue.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,790
Here take a look.

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,120
When I start shopping mode and
I buy something, it crosses it off,

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,980
which is great.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,180
But what would be even more great
is if when I cross an item off,

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,580
it could actually be in
a different part of the list.

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,780
So maybe down here I would have all
the items that I've already bought and

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,700
separated up here it would be the items
that haven't been bought yet.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,640
I have a feeling that
using a sorting query

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,940
you could separate out the bought
items from the un-bought items.

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,600
I'll go ahead and send over the spec
which outlines exactly what I want, and

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,570
maybe you can take a stab at it.
