1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
And this was probably a bit challenging but I think it's also quite fun actually

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,250
to play around with these ideas here.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,910
This pre-processing rule here is actually correct and the reason is the following--

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,130
so you have this vertex here and it has just one neighbor, so you have this edge here.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,040
We already know either this vertex has to be in the vertex cover or this one

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,400
because, otherwise, this edge here would not be covered.

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,360
Now, taking both is clearly is a waste.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,050
You wouldn't want to do that because once we have put this one here into the vertex cover,

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,670
you do not need to put that one into the vertex cover, but if you know that you only need

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,610
to put one of the two vertices into the vertex cover--well, in that case it's always better

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,520
to put this one here into the vertex cover because it will not only cover

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,760
this edge but also some additional edges.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,290
And in this case here, you've basically paid one vertex but you only get to cover one edge,

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,320
so it's always better to use this one in that case, which also means that this rule here is not correct.

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,770
Now, what about this case over here.

16
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:00,790
You might be inclined to think that this is the same case so that instead of using this vertex here

17
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,570
it's always better to put these two into the vertex cover, but unfortunately that is not the case

18
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,470
and I will give you a very simple example of this.

19
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,400
If you have a graph that looks like this for example--you look at it this way

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,280
that this part here is the same as this part here, then you can see that if you put these two vertices

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,990
into a vertex cover, then you need an additional two vertices and it can be either one of those

22
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,200
or either one of those but you need two more to cover the whole graph.

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,940
This would give you a solution of size 4, and actually, this graph has a vertex cover of size 3

24
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:37,040
if you use this one here and this one and this one and you have a size 3 solution.

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,500
This is not a correct rule because it can lead us to find a suboptimal solution.

26
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,040
So you have to be careful with pre-processing rules as useful as they are,

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,990
but actually just having this one rule over here is already pretty cool because what does it tell us--

28
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,730
Well, once we have a vertex with one neighbor such as this one here, we'll put that one

29
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,730
into the vertex cover and we also know that we do not need to put this one here into the vertex cover,

30
00:02:00,730 --> 99:59:59,999
and this will now help us to improve our search tree.
