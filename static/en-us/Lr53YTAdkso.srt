00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,960
For the first question,
the answer is messages.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,474
If you open up the application project
and look in the main activity dot Java,

3
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:08,980
you'll find send/start
activity message in there.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,780
And you'll see that it makes
calls to send message.

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,130
And for this question, the answer is
it runs on the background thread.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,910
You'll see it as code from a-sync
task and the do in background method.

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,380
You're not allowed to make calls
like this on the UI thread.
