1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,850
Instantly recognized by most of the
connected world, the Google logo wasn't

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,210
always so polished and
also has a rich typographic history.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,010
>> The original logo was
created by Sergey Brin in GIMP

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,130
in a typoface called Baskerville Bold.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,700
That's right, in GIMP.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,500
There was even a time when
the Google logo had a exclamation

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,470
point like with Yahoo!

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,880
>> Ruth Kedar designed
the logo we see today, but

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,300
before the final design was reached,
>> She iterated on a whole bunch of

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,180
ideas.

11
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,930
The final wordmark is set
in the Catull typeface,

12
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,910
using the primary colors in green.

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,780
It's continued to evolve over the past
16 years with minor refinements, and

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,865
most recently,
a flatter more simplified look.

15
00:00:36,865 --> 00:00:39,475
>> Now Google doodles have
become a much anticipated

16
00:00:39,475 --> 00:00:41,265
part of the Google.com homepage.

17
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:44,065
but did you know the idea for
doodles came about when Sergai and

18
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:47,615
Larry wanted to mark the occasion
of attending Burning Man in 1998.

19
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:50,935
>> The doodle is a temporary
mask that denotes holidays,

20
00:00:50,935 --> 00:00:52,825
signficant events, or figures.

21
00:00:52,825 --> 00:00:56,015
The doodles stylistically mix
organic and inorganic objects and

22
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,920
figures to make the letter forms.

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,510
>> And after viewing just a few of them,
thanks to the gestalt laws of grouping,

24
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,239
your brain immediately
recognizes even very lyrical and

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,120
stylized drawings as the individual
letters in the word Google.

26
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,420
>> Now material design utilizes
these very same principles and

27
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,350
concepts to make it easier for
users to comprehend your UI.

28
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,255
Knowing all that will you look at
the Google logo the same ever again?
