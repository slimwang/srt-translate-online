Thanks, Matt, for explaining that. So, the key point here is that genes provide

2
00:00:04,384 --> 00:00:09,988
raw building material, but development is highly variable. It's often difficult

3
00:00:09,988 --> 00:00:15,001
to draw a direct link between genes and behavior. Behavior and psychological

4
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:19,225
traits are often influenced by not only one gene, but by multiple genes working

5
00:00:19,225 --> 00:00:26,590
together to produce a trait. We call these traits, polygenic. And the traits

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,348
influenced by a single gene, we call monogenic. Virtually, every psychological

7
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:36,435
trait or phenomenon, like intelligence or personality, are influenced by many

8
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:41,023
genes. Other traits, such as sexuality or metabolism, are also influenced by

9
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:46,036
multiple genes, so they're polygenic. Some monogenic traits, that are typically

10
00:00:46,036 --> 00:00:50,068
influenced by a single gene are lactose intolerance, blood type or even skin

11
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:51,749
color.
