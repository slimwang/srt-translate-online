1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,570
Of these options, only the third
one doubles the bisection width.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,510
The other options reduce the diameter,
but

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,850
they can't asymptotically
improve the bisection width.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,480
As an example, let's take option two.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,030
Now, the original bisection cut is
still a cut of this new network, but

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,620
notice that the number of
links only increases by one,

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,260
two links That is, it doesn't double.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,950
By contrast, consider option three.

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,060
Notice what happens at the cut.

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,450
There are in fact, square of P new
links that go through this cut.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,430
That doubles the bisecting width.

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,180
Yeah, I'm awesome.

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:37,730
Do bulls moo?

14
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:38,340
Moo, moo.
