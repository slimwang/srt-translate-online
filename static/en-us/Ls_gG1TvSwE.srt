1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,045
Recall that the typical multi chronic
disease patient, like Marla here,

2
00:00:05,045 --> 00:00:09,190
fills around 50 prescriptions a year,
because for

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,150
most chronic diseases medications
are the main treatment.

4
00:00:13,253 --> 00:00:18,155
Misuse of medication, including in
particular duplicate medications,

5
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:22,625
because of poor coordination among
providers, is a major problem

6
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:27,335
that accounts for nearly a third
of all hospitalizations in the US.

7
00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:33,730
Surveys by the Commonwealth Fund
in 2008 and 2011 show progress.

8
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,155
Here we see the United States improving.

9
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:41,450
But still,
28% of patients surveyed report

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,270
that no provider has reviewed their
medications with them in the past year.

11
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,080
Such review could help ensure
that patients are taking

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,927
only the medications they need,
and are taken them properly.

13
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,930
One reason for the absence of review,
is that physicians may not even know

14
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,560
the medications that other
physicians have prescribed.

15
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,460
We'll return to it later on, but

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,630
this process called
medication reconciliation,

17
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:13,280
is a clear opportunity for health IT,
once the underlying records are digital.

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,640
Here's a screenshot from
an actual commercial HIT system.

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,240
Showing the medications in this
physicians EMR on the right, and

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,800
those out in other EMR's on the left.

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,760
The system even highlights this
medication,which the patient is taking,

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,730
but which isn't in this provider's EMR.
