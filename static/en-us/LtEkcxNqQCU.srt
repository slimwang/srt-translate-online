1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,420
Let's look through the options.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,670
This one is likely to save way more versions than you really need.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,470
But even if you're only actually saving when there's been a change over

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,770
the course of the hour,

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,360
you're likely to save at points that don't make a lot of sense.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,685
What if you're in the middle of typing a line?

7
00:00:13,685 --> 00:00:16,110
Your saved versions might not even compile,

8
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,005
much less make sense as a logical checkpoint.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,700
This option does have the advantage that if you tend to be forgetful, and

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,230
not save often enough on your own it can give you more fine grain detail than

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,340
you would have had.

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,390
But otherwise, there's not much reason to make this choice.

13
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,660
Okay, let's look at the second one.

14
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,170
This has some of the same problems as the above, and

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,650
you might get versions that aren't actually usable.

16
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,060
Plus, if you write a critical three line change one day and

17
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,690
then don't touch the code for a week, your change doesn't get

18
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,380
recorded until after you've made some other unrelated changes.

19
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,810
What about this third one?

20
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,410
This one's a little bit more promising.

21
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,100
You'll probably get some changes that have some kind of logical meaning from

22
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,070
this strategy.

23
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,980
But, you might also get some not so meaningful ones that come up when you

24
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,560
have to go run to catch your train or go have a nice dinner.

25
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,500
Okay, so what about this fourth one?

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,700
This has the potential downside of user error.

27
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,920
Not saving often enough or

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,840
saving too often, but it also offers a lot of flexibility.
