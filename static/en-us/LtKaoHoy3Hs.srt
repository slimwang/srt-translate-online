00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,344
Hi, I'm Gabrielle and
I'm going to be your instructor for

2
00:00:03,344 --> 00:00:05,675
this short course on Swift Syntax.

3
00:00:05,675 --> 00:00:08,870
Swift is already having a huge
impact on iOS development.

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,910
It's fast, concise, easy to read, and
comes with tools like playgrounds that

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,000
make it easier than ever
to visualize your code.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,100
A welcoming language for beginner and
intermediate programmers,

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,030
Swift makes the road to building your
own iOS apps considerably less steep.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,360
Fantastic resources for
learning Swift are easy to find.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,210
Not least among them is Apple's guide,
The Swift Programming Language

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,980
which we hope you'll come
to rely on as a reference.

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,495
This course hopes to offer something
that is less common among other Swift

12
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,990
resources, practice.

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,702
Throughout the course, we'll be
working through examples together, and

14
00:00:43,702 --> 00:00:46,486
each lesson will end with a set
of exercises to get you more

15
00:00:46,486 --> 00:00:48,757
comfortable with Swift's idiosyncrasies.

16
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:52,071
We'll start out with some basics
of types and operators and

17
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:56,187
practice manipulating strings and
declaring variables and constants.

18
00:00:56,187 --> 00:00:59,272
Then we'll move on to what is
arguably Swifts most unique and

19
00:00:59,272 --> 00:01:00,483
confounding feature.

20
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:02,143
Optional types.

21
00:01:02,143 --> 00:01:04,885
We'll talk about collections and
control flow,

22
00:01:04,885 --> 00:01:07,834
including lots of practice
with switch statements.

23
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,240
Functions and classes.

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,040
Enumerations and structs.

25
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,080
Which are considerably more powerful
in Swift than in other languages.

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,410
Protocols.

27
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,510
And will wrap things up by
exploring closure expressions.

28
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,170
Which can be tricky at first, but

29
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,810
wonderfully convenient once
you get the hang of them.

30
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,040
This course is designed for

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,350
programmers who have some prior
object oriented experience.

32
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,130
For students who,
through work with other languages

33
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,851
are already familiar with most of
the concepts I've just listed.

34
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,490
So let's get started with Swift types.
