00:00:00,902 --> 00:00:02,719
Alright, so let's take a moment to have a quiz where we

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:05,939
really delve deeply into what it means to have a best attribute.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,880
So something Michael and I have been throwing around that term, let's

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,380
see if we can define it a little bit more crisply. So,

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,430
what you have in front of you are three different attributes that

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:20,740
we might apply in our decision tree for sorting out our instances.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,550
So, at the top of the screen what you have is you

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,120
have a cloud of instances. They are labelled either with red x or

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,180
a green o, and that represents the label so that means

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,955
that they are part of our training set, so this is what

11
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:36,710
we're using to build and to learn our Decision Tree. So,

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,278
in the first case you have the set of instances being sorted

13
00:00:40,278 --> 00:00:43,390
into two piles. There are some xs and some os on

14
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,020
the left and some xs and some os on the right. And

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,560
the second case you have that same set of data being

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,240
sorted so that all of it goes to the left and none

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,320
of it goes to the right. And in the third case you have that same set of

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,350
data that's sorted so that a bunch of the xs end up on the left and a

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:04,000
bunch of the os end up on the right. What I want you to do is to rank each one,

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,650
where one is the best and three is the least best attribute to choose. Go.
