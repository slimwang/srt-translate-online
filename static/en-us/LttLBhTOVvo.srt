1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,939
By randomly assigning groups, the different groups on average will be similar

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,460
to each other. They will have about the same number of men and women, young and

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,140
old, and all different characteristics. With random assignment, we can say that

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:19,130
the two groups were equivalent at the start of the study. That way, any changes

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,164
at the end of the study are most likely due to our independent variable,

6
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:28,000
caffeine. Random assignment helps to eliminate bias. There was a good reason

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,700
why we didn't want to use the other types of groups, such as male and female.

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,920
Or the first half of the participants who showed up got caffeine, and the

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,600
second half didn't get caffeine. There's something innately different between

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,260
those two groups. And by using random assignment, we don't have to worry about

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:42,599
that.
