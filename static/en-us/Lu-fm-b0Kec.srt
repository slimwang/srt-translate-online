1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,602
The numerator is just a difference of 2 squares, so it's equal to x plus 1

2
00:00:03,602 --> 00:00:07,251
times x minus 1, and the denominator, a factor of 2, has already pulled out for

3
00:00:07,251 --> 00:00:15,753
us. So x squared minus 3x plus 2 factors to be x minus 2 times x minus 1.
