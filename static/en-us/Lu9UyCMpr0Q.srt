1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now the next question is what representation for states should we use

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
if we want to generalize this problem.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So that we're given an initial state when there can be any number of missionaries,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
cannibals, and boats on one side of the river

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and any number on the other.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Which of these representations is sufficient under those conditions?
