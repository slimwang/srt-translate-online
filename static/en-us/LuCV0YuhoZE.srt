1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,810
To continue through all the debuggers, I'm simply going to close the web

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,500
console and see what gets displayed in my chart.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,520
And as you can see here, we've drawn one blue circle for

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,340
every game of the World Cup throughout the years.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,990
Now, there's a few style issues, I'm going to clean up simply with some CSS.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,980
Mainly, the width of the access lines, the years on the x-axis, and

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,640
something you may not be able to notice here,

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,230
is that there's a lot of overlap in the circles.

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,230
So by adding some opacity to the circles, you can see similar to what we

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,776
saw in the Facebook IPO example, some overlap to know the density of points.

11
00:00:39,776 --> 00:00:45,910
So again, using CSS to style my axis and my SVG circles,

12
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:52,189
in my text, the chart looks much nicer and much crisper.

13
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:56,250
I don't want to go, spend the time to go through every one of the CSS changes

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,902
I've made, but if you're interested, and you're comfortable enough with CSS,

15
00:01:00,902 --> 00:01:03,259
I encourage you to look back at the files and

16
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:07,679
use the CSS resource we have provided, to understand better what's going on.

17
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:11,490
So after all of these updates, that we've made in D3,

18
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,626
we finally have a equivalent chart that we made in dimple js,

19
00:01:15,626 --> 00:01:20,979
with its short five lines, but again by converting our previous chart to D3,

20
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:25,765
it's going to allow us much more flexibility to add both interaction and

21
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:28,795
to customize the look and feel of the chart.

22
00:01:28,795 --> 00:01:32,888
And when all is said and done, took only approximately 40 or

23
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:37,147
more lines of D3 to recreate what we've done in dimple in five.

24
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:40,126
But if you're going to be a stickler about it, each of

25
00:01:40,126 --> 00:01:45,050
these statements here technically is one line, one long chain of functions.

26
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,790
But for clarity's sake, I've written every new function call on a new line
