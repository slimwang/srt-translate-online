1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,494
Now remember, when we calculate the z score of any value in the distribution,

2
00:00:04,494 --> 00:00:08,850
we first subtract the mean which shifts the distribution without changing the

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:15,294
shape so that zero is now the mean. And when we divide by the standard

4
00:00:15,294 --> 00:00:21,195
deviation, we then change the shape. Let's look at it this way. We have any

5
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:26,770
distribution, with mean, mu, and standard deviation, sigma. Which basically

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,707
means that sigma is one standard deviation away from the mean. After we

7
00:00:30,707 --> 00:00:36,400
standardize this distribution, what is going to be the z-score of sigma? Well,

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,965
remember when we subtract mu, we shift it so that mu is now zero. So now, the

9
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:48,150
z-score of sigma is going to be sigma minus zero divided by sigma, which is

10
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:55,287
sigma divided by sigma, which is 1. So, the z-score of any value, that's one

11
00:00:55,287 --> 00:01:02,700
standard deviation away from the mean, will then be 1 after we standardize it.

12
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,238
Which means that the new standard deviation of this normalized distribution, or

13
00:01:07,238 --> 00:01:10,384
standard distribution, is 1.
