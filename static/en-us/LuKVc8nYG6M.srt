00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,950
And now we've arrived at the end of
our quest to greater productivity.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,790
You've learned how to set up
your editor to code like a pro.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,350
>> Got familiar with Gulp.

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,012
>> Dramatically improved your
workflow with live editing.

5
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:14,840
>> Set up safety nets for easier
teamwork and better quality control.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,200
>> And optimized the crap out of
your site to ship it to your users.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,620
That was a lot, I can't believe we've
done all of that in such a short time.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,640
Be sure to grab the summary notes with
all the links to relevant downloads and

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,330
projects, and happy tooling.
