1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,530
Okay, great, we now have a UI defined
and our Android manifest is almost done.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,800
But because we're using Google Services,
there is one meta tag that we need to

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,080
add, and that's just to specify that
we're using the Play Services Library.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,070
We do that like this.

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,330
The metadata tag is used
within the application tag and

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,360
it should be a sibling of the activity,
not a child.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,785
Within that, your specified Android is
com.google.android.gms.version, and

8
00:00:27,785 --> 00:00:32,830
the value for this is
atInteger/GooglePlayServices_version.

9
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,730
Now as you can see here
it's showing up red.

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,880
It's showing up as an error
you cant resolve symbol,

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,640
but we're going to fix that in a moment.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,330
And also once that's been fixed, once
your application has been configured to

13
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,810
use these services libraries
whenever you compile,

14
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,000
this will be filled in automatically
with the correct number.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,890
So let's go ahead and do that.

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,170
So in order to do that there's one other
place that we need to ensure that we're

17
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,540
using the libraries for the services and
that's in the build.gradle for

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,010
the app itself.

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,116
So if I go into the build.gradle for
the app,

20
00:01:01,116 --> 00:01:04,310
down here you can see the dependencies
at bottom of build.gradle.

21
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,220
We're going to add a new
dependency in here.

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,086
So what we want to add is quite simply,

23
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:15,836
to compile conduct
google.android.gms:play-services:6.5+.

24
00:01:15,836 --> 00:01:19,790
Now it's important to note that
your version here may be different.

25
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,950
It depends on what you're using, and

26
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,860
what version of Play Services
you've installed.

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,880
You can take a look in your system to
see what versions have been installed

28
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,960
for you.

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,540
And I'm just using this plus,
just to make life a little bit easier.

30
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,750
I believe I have 6.5.0.87.

31
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,990
But of course, by the time your
watching this Play Services

32
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,800
might be in version 7 or later and as
you can see here, you should avoid using

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,210
plus in version numbers because it
can lead to unpredictable behavior.

34
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,020
But I'm just going to leave it in for
the time being, for simplicity.

35
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,660
But do note when you're building your
applications that you should use

36
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,320
the correct version number here.

37
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,260
So now, once we've done this, we're
going to go to our main activity, and

38
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,070
we're going to access
the location provider.

39
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,570
Now, in our main activity, remember that
it contains just a single text view.

40
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,440
When the user runs the app,

41
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,080
we want it to get the current
location using location services, and

42
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,650
write the latitude of the current
location into that text view.

43
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,020
In order to do this, we're going to
need to write some code in the activity.

44
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,870
This code will create
the Google API Client, and

45
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,660
set up the required call backs to catch
responses back from location services.
