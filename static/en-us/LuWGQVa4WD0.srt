00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,630
Remember our concepts of using kernels, to help us do this.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,270
In this case, let's actually build two kernels, one in the ver,

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,790
vertical direction and the other one in the horizontal direction, and just for

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,250
the sake of the completeness, here actually basically given you the values

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,780
where a and the one fourth, number here, one fourth minus a over 2,

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:26,380
in both directions, again, symmetry, in v and symmetry in h, using this,

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,550
of course, we basically now should be able to compute this, this is a concept

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,460
laid out in Berton Adelson, and I refer you to that paper for more details.

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,260
In this case, a values basically are computed to be the following,

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,840
by Berton Adelson, and of course, now using these, horizontal and

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,460
vertical kernels we can actually create an h which would be

12
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,890
the kernel we want to use to doing any kind of processing, and

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,860
this is what was used, as an h function to compute all of this.
