1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We're almost there. Things are coming together very nicely.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The only thing we're missing is set anchors.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We have to somehow take a row and the row number within the board

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and figure out where all the anchors are and what the values of those anchors are.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
To find the anchors we can do that within the row.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
An anchor is something that's next to an existing letter.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That will get most of the anchors but not quite all of them,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
because notice if we didn't have this row here, we wouldnât know that that spot is an anchor.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To find all the anchors, we're going to have to look at all the rows

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
or at least the two adjacent rows on either side.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
To find what the anchors are in terms of the set--can anything go there as in this anchor,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
as in this anchor, any letter can appear there, or is it a restricted set like this one.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That we're also going to have to know--what are the other cross words?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Here, if there's only a U there and nothing down below--

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
this is the edge of the board or there is empty stuff down below--

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
then this anchor can only be the letters that fit in there to make a word going in this direction.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Let's dive right into defining set anchors.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This is different than most of the functions written so far in that it actually mutates the row

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
rather than returning a result.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We start in the normal way. We're going to iterate over the row--the good parts of the row.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Then what I'm going to do is take the i-j position on the board

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and find all the neighbors for that board--

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that is all the squares in the in the north, south, east, and west location.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Then I'm going to say what are the anchors?

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Well, if the square is the star, the starting square, then that's an anchor by definition.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Otherwise, if the square is empty and any of the neighbors is a letter, then that's an anchor.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now, I've arranged that neighbors(board) is a function that returns the neighbors in this order--

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
north, south, east, and west--and now I'm saying we're operating on a row,

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
if the neighbor to the north or the south is a letter,

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
then we have a cross word that we have to deal with.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If not, then it's an unrestricted anchor.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What do I want to do if I have these crosswords?

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I want to find the crossword on the board. What does that mean?

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
In this location right here, which would be row 2 and column 2,

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I want to say that the word on the board is an empty square followed by a U.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If I go into the interpreter, I want to be able to have this interaction where here is my board.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now if I find crosswords within that board from position 2, 2--that's that position right there

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
right after the A and above the U--what I want to say is that there is a word,

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and the word is a dot followed by a U--there it is.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If we fill in that anchor, we're going to have a word, which is a dot followed by a U.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Where does the word start? Well, it starts in position 2.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It could have started someplace else.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If we had a big board, there might have been a word that started all the way up here and went down.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
For example, we're not actually going to call find<u>cross</u>word on positions that aren't anchors,

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
but if we did, it would still work.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
If we find cross words from position 1, 2--that's the where the A is--

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
what's the cross word that intersects through that A? Well, that's JAG.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It begins in row number 1.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Now we're up here, we found the cross words,

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
we found the row that the cross word begins in, we found what the word is,

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and now we're saying we're going to fill in this location. It's going to be an anchor.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's anchor where the letters are all the letters with which we can replace the dot in dot U

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and make something which is a word.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We can go back to our interpreter and test that out.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We can say if W is the dot U, then what is this anchor of all the letters

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
where W replaced by a letter is in WORDS.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's the anchor with X, M, and N as possibilities.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Now we're going to say insert that anchor into row[ i ].

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Insert into this spot to the right of the A above the U the anchor

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
that says an X, an M, or an N can occur right in that location.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's setting the anchor if there are cross letters above or below.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Otherwise, we have an unrestricted anchor.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
For example, this anchor here to the left of the D--any letter can go in there.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We've already defined the global variable any to be the anchor that allows any letter to occur.
