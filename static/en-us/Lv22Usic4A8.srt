00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,360
>> So let's see how measures of center change when we have different

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,582
distributions. On this positively skewed distribution, which do you think is

3
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:11,512
true? Do you think the mean is less than the median, which is less than the

4
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:15,889
mode? Or do you think the mean is the greatest, and the median is the smallest?

5
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:20,603
Or do you think the mode is less than the median, is less than the mean? Or do

6
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:25,531
you think the median is the greatest and the mode is the smallest? Now remember,

7
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:29,826
on the x axis, we go from least to greatest. So, on this distribution, think

8
00:00:29,826 --> 00:00:34,242
about where the mean, median and mode would lie on the x axis, and choose which

9
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:38,572
one of these you think is true. This is a really difficult question that

10
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:43,262
requires you to think about everything we've talked about so far, how the median

11
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:47,602
and mode are not affected as much by outliers as the mean, how the mode is not

12
00:00:47,602 --> 00:00:52,222
affected by outliers at all, and how the median will barely change if an outlier

13
00:00:52,222 --> 00:00:54,336
is added. Give it your best shot.
