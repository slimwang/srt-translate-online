00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,490
Finally, to complete
the definition of our MDP,

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,880
we need to specify the states in
which the agent's action terminates.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,170
For this particular problem,

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,210
the MDP we're building won't
have any terminal states.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,310
So this will be relatively quick to do.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,620
Take a look at the TerminalFunction
Interface documentation.

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,770
One of the implementations of
this interface provides precisely

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,660
the functionality we need for
this problem.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,010
Which one is it?

00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,240
