1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,100
So let's talk about
security in Firebase.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,370
Taking a step back,

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,730
when we say security, we can divide
this up into three subcategories.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,150
Authentication, authorization and
validation.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,940
We discussed authentication
in version 0.3 of

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,630
the app when we added the ability
to log in using Firebase.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,580
Authorization is about controlling
access to your data by specifying

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,790
who has read write permission and
to what objects in your database.

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,760
Authorization is often used in
conjunction with authentication.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,690
This is a fancy way of saying
you can have somebody log in and

11
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,850
then only allow them to look at
information related to them,

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,160
such as limiting the list of
shopping lists they can access.

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,540
The final form of security, validation,
is used to check that the data conforms

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,120
to some expected standard for
the structure of the data.

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,020
For example, validation rules
can specify exactly what

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,890
properties a shopping list
object can contain, or

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,530
verify that an e-mail address
contains an at symbol.

18
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:05,489
Lyla was worried about either herself or
somebody else adding these unnecessary.

19
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,390
And in some cases malformed feels
to shopping less plus plus.

20
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,910
Given that, which of these three topics
should we start talking about to

21
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,640
solve that issue.
