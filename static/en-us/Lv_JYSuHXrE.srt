00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,100
When it comes to 6-DOF tracking,
things aren't simple.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,310
There isn't some standard sensor that
we can use to quickly figure out where

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,029
things are located.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,270
In fact,
it's an area of ongoing research and

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,740
it's something that I personally
find very fascinating.

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,420
Almost every high end VR
headset uses a different

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,700
kind of optical tracking system.

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,640
But there are all kinds of other
approaches that can also be used.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,120
There are tracking systems
using magnetism and acoustics,

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,190
that are also very variable.

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,025
And even among the optical tracking
systems, there is a lot of variations.

12
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:40,155
In short, there is a lot of
work being done to improve our

13
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:45,325
ability to quickly and accurately detect
the positions of objects in 3D space.

14
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:48,455
Let's talk about how the major
6-DOF tracking systems work.
