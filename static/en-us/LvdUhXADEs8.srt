1
00:00:00,442 --> 00:00:03,730
Alright, so at this point we know we're
going to use Scale Type to expand

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,720
our image.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,580
So, now what I want you to do is
actually expand the image to fill

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,000
the entire screen.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,522
Now a couple of hints on how to do this.

6
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:14,620
Hint number one, now there are actually
a lot of different values that you can

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,400
set Scale Type to, but in the lesson
we only taught you about two, so

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,370
let's stick with thinking about those.

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,020
The values that we know about
are center and center crop.

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,730
Knowing what you know from the lesson,

11
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,060
which one of these do
you think we should use?

12
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,780
Now once you've used scale type properly
to make the image expand to the entire

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,610
screen, there's a possibility
that your text will disappear.

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,220
If this happens to you, try changing
around the ordering of your views.
