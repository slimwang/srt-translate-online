1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,960
The first factor we see is just X, which is associated with a 0, X equals 0.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,141
There's only one of them so I write a 1 in this box. The other two 0's find are

3
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:15,770
at X equals 1 and X equals 2. Each of the factors associated with these appears

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,400
twice in the equation. If we add these numbers up we see that there are five

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,478
0's total, referenced by the factors in this equation. And as you might have

6
00:00:25,478 --> 00:00:29,574
expected, the total number of zeros we have 5 is equal to the number of factors

7
00:00:29,574 --> 00:00:33,478
or rather linear factors we see in the polynomial, and is also equal to the

8
00:00:33,478 --> 00:00:40,540
degree of this polynomial function. Once again we see that the linear factors

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:46,653
zeros, in the degree of a polynomial function, are all very closely connected.
