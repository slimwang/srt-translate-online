1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,060
Now in this instance also if you notice this kernel.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,050
If I did any kind of horizontal or

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,456
vertical flips to it, it would still appear the same.

4
00:00:08,456 --> 00:00:12,517
So of course, because of that, both cross-correlation and

5
00:00:12,517 --> 00:00:15,259
convolution would have the same output.

6
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:17,000
And these would of course be the wrong ones.
