1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,500
Great now that our
environment is set up,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,970
let's start coding an interstitial ad.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,060
The first thing we have to do
in our AdActivity Java code

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,380
is to set up our application key.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,070
We do this by saying
AdRegistration.setAppKey and

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,290
then you'd put in your unique app key.

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,360
This key is given to you
when you register for

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,570
a game developer account through Amazon,
and it's unique for every app.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,310
It helps identify your app, and
keep track of ad displays and

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,775
clicks that your app receives.

11
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:33,200
You'd usually use your own app key,
but since we're just doing a general

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,910
example, I'll use a sample
key that Amazon provides.

13
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,150
Now let's make our ad.

14
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,757
First I'm going to make a private
variable of interstitial ad type,

15
00:00:41,757 --> 00:00:44,375
which we know is a class
in our Amazon ads library.

16
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,284
Then I'll give it a name,
InterstitialAd.

17
00:00:47,284 --> 00:00:51,223
Now that we have our ad variable,
we're going to create an instance of it,

18
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:52,820
load it, and show it.

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,770
So back to our onCreate method.

20
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,600
I can create our ad by saying this,
then giving the variable name,

21
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:05,880
InterstitialAd equals a new
InterstitialAd object.

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,510
This ad object needs to know the
activity it's going to be used in, and

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,530
again that's just going
to be this activity.

24
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,800
That is to say,
our InterstitialAd activity.

25
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,690
Then I just need to add a line
of code to load our ad,

26
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,410
which is as simple as saying our
variable interstitial ad.loadad.

27
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,050
But what happens once this ad is loaded?

28
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,620
I'll have to create an ad listener
that will just listen to the ad and

29
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,200
decide what happens when it's loaded or
when it's closed.

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,650
To listen to our ad, we have to say
this.interstitial.ad.setListener,

31
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,280
and then we're going to
define a listener of our own.

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,400
So we're going to create an Internet
class called MyCustomListener,

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,720
and we'll just build off
the default add listener.

34
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,325
So we'll say MyCustomListener
extends default ad listening.

35
00:01:55,325 --> 00:02:00,055
The listener notices what happens to
our ad at three different points,

36
00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:03,265
which are methods in the listener class.

37
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:07,480
One point when the ad is loaded or
unloaded,

38
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,040
which takes in the ad object and
its properties as parameters.

39
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,430
A second point, if the ad fails to load,
which will throw an error message,

40
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,299
and a third point when the ad is
dismissed, that is when it's closed.

41
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,490
And we can write in
specific behaviors for

42
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,880
our ad or
app at each of these three points.

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,870
For example,

44
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,400
if our ad fails to load we might want to
put in code to call a backup ad network.

45
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,210
If our ad is closed, we might want to
put in code to resume our game.

46
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,400
But for now we're going to focus on
what happens once our ad is loaded.

47
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,410
Once our ad is loaded,
I'm just going to want to show it.

48
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,025
So to do that, I want to specify
the activity that it's in, and

49
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:51,051
then a reference to our ad object.

50
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:57,353
And then similar to loading the ad,
I just say .showad.

51
00:02:57,353 --> 00:03:01,400
It's important that the show ad is
inside the on ad loaded method,

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,130
because we can only show
an ad after it's been loaded.

53
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,880
So if we put it up here and
it didn't load, we would get an error.

54
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,911
So this method is all we
really need to show our ad.

55
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:16,229
And the last thing we need to do is
specify that we're using this custom

56
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,060
listener of ours.

57
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,120
So let's replace this with
a new MyCustomListener object.
