1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,170
There's a couple mistakes when you're thinking about value proposition.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:07,780
One is that what you're building might just be a feature of someone else's product.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,260
You might have a good feature extension, but it might not be a business,

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,250
or it might be a business for about 9 months

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,379
till the incumbent just adds that in their next release.

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,550
As I said earlier, these prioritizations of pains and gains

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,940
sometimes helps you avoid the "it's nice to have" problem.

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,340
Sometimes it's very easy for founders to say, "Well, they all liked it."

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,610
Well, okay. What you really want is they didn't like it; they've got to have it.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,150
In fact, they didn't let me leave until they let me use the prototype.

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,810
That's when you know you have a business.

12
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,960
It has to be something that people demand,

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,790
and there have to be enough of them to demand.

14
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,760
You might find, yeah, I found the 5 people in the entire world that love the product,

15
00:00:48,760 --> 99:59:59,999
but that might not be a large enough market.
