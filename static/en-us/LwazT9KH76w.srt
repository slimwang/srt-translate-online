00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,190
You might wonder why we should care about negative space and

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,580
its relation to data visualization.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,890
And well, we should pay attention to negative space,

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,740
because it communicates something about our data.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,860
Let's look at two examples.

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,850
This first one explores the London's cholera outbreak in 1854.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,700
John Snow documented deaths around the community to determine what might be

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,740
the cause of the epidemic.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,210
He created this stop map by recording the location of each death by a bar.

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,170
The height or the length of these bars indicate that more deaths occurred in

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,950
a particular location.

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,480
Knowing this information, I'd like you to answer a question.

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,930
Which of these locations have no recorded deaths?

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,020
You can use the map that's linked in the instructor notes to figure it out.
