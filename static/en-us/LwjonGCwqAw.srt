1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,070
And at last, we have the final diagram summarizing everything that we have done.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,800
This example is just meant to illustrate what real problem solving is like.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,300
In real model building, we make choices that we think will lead to new insights,

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,410
which then reveal new paths of analysis,

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,970
which build upon previous knowledge to gradually arrive at the model.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,186
Very soon, we'll work together through a complete example from the ground up to

7
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:28,000
see the iterative cycles of question, model and validate built upon each other.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,430
You'll see how to turn a vague question into a rigorous problem of

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,400
statistical inference through successive refinement.

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,360
You'll learn to identify possible next iterations and

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,840
how to use them to generate possible paths of analysis.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,180
By the end of this lesson, you will feel confident in your ability to

13
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,150
tackle new difficult problems and start making progress with them.

14
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,260
The choices we make during each phase can be diagrammed in

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,930
a tree like the one here.

16
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,570
It's a useful tool for considering our possible paths forward during analysis,

17
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,260
as well as revealing options for revisiting steps when you

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,250
must inevitably adjust decisions made during earlier phases.

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,450
In the rest of this lesson, we will apply each of these steps to an actual data

20
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,820
set and you will get a chance to follow along and practice these steps with us.
