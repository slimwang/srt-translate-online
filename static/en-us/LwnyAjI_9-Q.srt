00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,160
Let's see if you're paying attention.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,765
Consider this list.

3
00:00:03,765 --> 00:00:07,410
Suppose the initial coin toss
produces the following result.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,100
If you finish running
the independent set scheme,

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,270
which nodes will end up
in the independent set?

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,090
Type the list of nodes in this box.
