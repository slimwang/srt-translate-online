00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
Hey everyone, it's me, Jared. I'm filling

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,200
in for rod right now and I'd like to

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,310
show you the app we're going to create

4
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,109
in this course called Pitch Perfect.

5
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:09,420
Pitch Perfect allows you to record your

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,400
voice and play it back with various

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,469
sound effects, including changes to speed

8
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,440
pitch and even reverb and echo.

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,270
I'm running it here in the iOS simulator,

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,160
so that I can show you. The first screen

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,200
simply prompts you to record your voice.

12
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,119
Here at Udacity, we believe that asking

13
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,830
questions is one of the best ways to learn.

14
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,939
Judge a man by his questions

15
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,400
rather than by his answers. Now you can

16
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,690
see that Pitch Perfect has moved us to

17
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,879
the playback view. We can choose to play

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,829
back my voice using a variety of

19
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,570
different sound effects.

20
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,730
Let's try listening to my voice played

21
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,180
back really fast.

22
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,899
“Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers”

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,760
Or we can play back my voice at a really low

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,590
pitch and I'll sound like Darth Vader.

25
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:04,260
This app is a lot of fun to play with.

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,330
But more importantly, as you build this app,

27
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,280
you'll learn key iOS development

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,750
concepts along the way.
