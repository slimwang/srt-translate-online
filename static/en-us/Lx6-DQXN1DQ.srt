1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,700
My application has a ListView in it.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,340
And I've notice as I start
scrolling things just

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,210
tend to not become very smooth.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,530
I notice that I'm scrolling along and

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,280
like it's just taking a while or
it gets stuck.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,870
Like all these things happen
where it just feels quite janky.

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,480
You see that quite a bit.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,700
What are some things I could do
to start to debug those issues?

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,870
Where are some possible causes for that?

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,180
>> One cause could be that the data is
just not loading into your ListView

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,229
fast enough as you're swiping.

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,680
>> So
that's certainly a possible reason, but

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,960
let's suppose I have
all the data in memory.

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,610
So it's just a bunch of text fields or
something.

15
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,850
I have the data in memory.

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,120
What else could cause the issue?

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,720
>> Well, you say you have it in memory.

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,560
But if you're loading up all those
ListViews at once, it may not

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,835
necessarily populate all those-
>> Well the model I have in memory.

20
00:00:58,835 --> 00:01:05,862
>> Okay, so let me think, your ListView.

21
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:11,297
Yeah, it seem that you are, I mean,
are you loading any sort of

22
00:01:11,297 --> 00:01:16,531
memory intensive or like images or
high resolution images or

23
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:22,355
anything like in ListView that
would normally take a long time to?

24
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:23,515
>> I guess I could.

25
00:01:23,515 --> 00:01:25,345
I mean, let's say it does.

26
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:28,970
I guess where you're getting at
is that I could have an image.

27
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,990
And then somehow, loading those images
is taking time and could cause a delay.

28
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,950
Yeah, that's certainly possible.

29
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,140
But, let's say,
that's not happening in this case.

30
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,020
>> I think another possibility is that

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,870
your views are just not
getting reused fast enough.

32
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,050
You can't load everything all at once.

33
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,130
Typically, you would want to load
an item above and an item below, and

34
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,590
then the items on the screen,
and then reuse those.

35
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,650
>> So that's a common pattern that
you would use with like a ListView.

36
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,030
What is that commonly referred to as?

37
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,220
>> I know it as RecyclerView.

38
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,910
>> Yeah, so I mean I think that's
why RecyclerView has that name is

39
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,050
because it forces you to recycle views.

40
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,110
>> Right.

41
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,280
>> In ListView before it wasn't
enforced by the system and so

42
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,680
you just had to implement yourself.

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,130
That's something that people missed.

44
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,280
So yeah, that's perfect and

45
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,140
I think that's a lot of
cases where you'd have that.

46
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,590
Suppose for instance I'm recycling my
views, images are loading off the UI

47
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,940
thread, like the model seems to be
consuming a reasonable amount of memory,

48
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,650
do you have any other
ideas what could cause it?

49
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,940
>> So if you're using RecyclerView,
I know, RecyclerView is really good for

50
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,700
a lot of things and a lot of transitions
and things like that and unique things.

51
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:48,070
But one thing it's not good
at is views that are too

52
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:53,350
customized or things that are too high,
like images that are too high quality.

53
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,040
It can't process them very fast it's
doing other stuff in the background and

54
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,140
that makes it hang up
a little bit longer.

55
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,670
>> So think of your hinting at is that
I could have a very complex layout

56
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,660
that just takes a long time
to actually layout and draw.

57
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,350
So yeah that could be an issue possibly
the other thing you're thinking with

58
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,040
images could be that they're occupying
a larger memory footprint and

59
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,090
there's process of that has to be done.

60
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,260
So suppose for
instance I have a crop type.

61
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,900
I'm saying to center crop or
do whatever.

62
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,040
If the image is too large, then yeah
that could also take some time.

63
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,580
So yeah.

64
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,920
Those are all very good reasons.
