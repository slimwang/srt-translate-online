1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,930
Time to check out what
we've got loaded up.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,390
Let's open up the project pane by
clicking the tab at the top left,

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,010
or by hitting Cmd+1 if you're on a Mac.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,830
By default the project pane
only shows the source and

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,770
resources that are relevant
to an Android build.

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,060
That can be nice sometimes, but
for now let's use the drop-down

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,580
at the top of this pane to
open up the project view.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,810
There we go.
Now we can see all the files and

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,290
directories in our project directory.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,880
Let's open up the settings.gradle file.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,900
This shows us all the modules
that make up this project.

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,980
Looks like this build has desktop,
Android, iOS, and HTML modules.

13
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,080
So that's where the code for
each of those specific platforms lives.

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,660
Then there's also the core module.

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,380
That's where we'll write the code
that will run everywhere.

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,160
Not all of these files and folders
will be super relevant to you, but

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,230
I want to go over what
all of them do just so

18
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,326
that there's nothing that
seems magical in here.

19
00:00:53,326 --> 00:00:56,540
First the .gradle folder.

20
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,250
Gradle is a very smart build tool.

21
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,420
And when you ask it
to compile something,

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,890
it checks to see if it's
already compiled that file.

23
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,953
And if so, it says that that compilation
task is up-to-date and skips it.

24
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:11,990
The .gradle folder is where gradle
caches that sort of information.

25
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,610
The .idea folder is where Android Studio

26
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,020
holds its information about the project
and the state of the workspace.

27
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,700
It's just a ton of complicated
XML you don't need to touch.

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,480
We already talked about the android,
core, desktop, html and ios folders.

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,210
Then there's the gradle folder.

30
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,185
The gradle folder,
works together with the gradlew and

31
00:01:31,185 --> 00:01:34,570
gradlew.bat files to form what's
called the gradle wrapper.

32
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,110
Basically, the point is, that gradle
knows how to download itself, so

33
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,040
you can version control what
version of your build tools your

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,020
actually building the project with.

35
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,589
It's something super fancy
you don't need to touch, but

36
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:49,170
it's also why you didn't have to install
gradle in order to build this project.

37
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,053
Pretty, cool, right?

38
00:01:50,053 --> 00:01:54,040
The .gitignore file tells git which of
these files shouldn't be checked into

39
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,575
version control.

40
00:01:55,575 --> 00:01:58,540
These consists mostly of files
that are user specific settings,

41
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,980
like everything in the .idea folder.

42
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,120
And, of build outputs like everything
that's in each of the build folders

43
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,863
where gradle spits out its outputs.

44
00:02:06,863 --> 00:02:08,338
gradle.properties and

45
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:12,210
local.properties store more
gradle specific configuration.

46
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,590
Finally, there's a README file that
explains all this in much more detail.

47
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,220
So, that's it.

48
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,880
That's all of the files
on a libGDX project.

49
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,780
Nothing really magical.
