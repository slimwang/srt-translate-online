00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,990
Before we get to the practice for this lesson, let's try some number puzzles.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,028
This time the top numbers are negative. This means that one of that factors has

3
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:12,025
to be negative, since a negative times a positive is a negative number. I want

4
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:16,247
you to find the factors for these number puzzles. Remember, we want to find two

5
00:00:16,247 --> 00:00:20,663
numbers that multiply to the top number, but some to the bottom number, And it

6
00:00:20,663 --> 00:00:23,609
doesn't matter which order you place the factors.
