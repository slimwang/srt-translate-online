1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,789
So what exactly was happening
with shopping list plus, plus,

2
00:00:02,789 --> 00:00:04,350
why everything is so tricky?

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,360
>> Well, I can explain what the data
structure look like and then,

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,070
maybe you can explain
what the larger issue is.

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,040
Here, give me the tablet.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,000
So this is what our final
data schema looked like.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,730
The developers were swan enough
to make sure that all of our

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,060
data was denormalized.

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,910
Here you see we separated out shopping
list items from the actual lists.

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,280
And we did this because when we list
the shopping lists on the shopping list

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,860
fragment page, we knew that we didn't
also want to download all of the items.

12
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,260
And you can see that relationship here.

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,410
In the same way, we move shopping
list out from under users.

14
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,599
And instead, put them in their
separate denormalized node.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,220
To know who has access to them,

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,420
we store the owner as well as
the users that list was shared with.

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,610
Now, the issue that users were
experiencing was loading up the shopping

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,360
list fragments screen
here was super slow.

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,910
This screen here combines a list
that the users both shared on

20
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:56,830
with lists that they own.

21
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,490
For each user, this only amounted
to about ten or 20 shopping lists.

22
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,220
But it was sluggish to load up
even these ten or 20 items.

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,100
If you're wondering why, Walter,
well, I think our developer can

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,390
explain a little bit more about
what might have been going on.
