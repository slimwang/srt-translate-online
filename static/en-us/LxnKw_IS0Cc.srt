00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,530
In this lesson we have
learned what future many

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,820
core processors will probably look like.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,710
This concludes the third and

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,380
final part of my high performance
computer architecture course.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,240
I hope you have enjoyed this journey
through the guts of a modern processor

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,200
core, through its memory hierarchy, and

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,060
through the intricacies of multi-core
and multi-threaded execution.

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,680
It was certainly a pleasure for
me to teach this course.
