1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is the second choice. The evaluator needs to try decrypting each of these.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It knows one of the a values and one of the b values, but it doesn't know which one it knows.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The ones that aren't correct--well, it's going to have the wrong key.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's going to decrypt some message and it won't start with this pad.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That needs to have enough bits--so the chances it would start with this pad

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
if it is not the right key would be vanishingly small.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And the one where it does have the right keys will decrypt to the pad and the correct output value.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And that's the value--that's the output for that gate.
