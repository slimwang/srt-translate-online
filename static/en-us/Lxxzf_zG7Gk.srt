1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,170
Now to add an image to
the list item layout,

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,850
I'm going to open up the list
item dot XML layout file.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,460
We see here that it already
has two text views.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,580
One that holds Miwok word and
another for the English translation.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,250
So let's go ahead and
insert an image view here.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,850
I'm going to sign a view ID called image
because we were for to this in the Java

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,270
code reader, in order to make
changes to the image source and

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,560
as a note we don't need to do that
in this coding task particular, but

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,250
we will in the future one.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,440
Next let's set the layout width and
height to be both wrapped content.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,220
And lastly let's set the Android
source attribute to use

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,590
the app icon as the placeholder
image like we mention of the quiz.

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,627
So we refer to the app icon using
the syntax @mipmap/ic_launcher.

14
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:49,045
All right, that looks good so
let's test it by running our device now.

15
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:51,805
So with our device running let's
tap into the numbers activity.

16
00:00:51,805 --> 00:00:55,375
All right cool so it's running and
we have the image on our screen.

17
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:59,335
However the icon and the spacing doesn't
look quite like we wanted to just yet.

18
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:04,310
So from the quiz we saw that we
want the image on the left and

19
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,990
our text on the right.

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,570
So we'll need to make a few
adjustments to our layout.

21
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,330
So to modify this list item layout,
first I can see that we can build this

22
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,790
list item with the horizontal
linear layout.

23
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,430
So the first child is the image and

24
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,510
the second child is all
the text on the right.

25
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:27,590
So we can do this with the horizontal
linear layout with two child views.

26
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,840
We also notice that the second
child is made up of two text views

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,820
that are vertically stacked.

28
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,360
So this can be created with
a vertical linear layout.

29
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,550
So here we see that we have
a vertical linear layout

30
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,040
nested within the horizontal
linear layout.

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,610
This is a concept called
nested view groups.

32
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,005
So view groups contained
within other view groups.

33
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:53,835
And remember that we learned this topic
back in lesson two of the last course.

34
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:57,385
Now back in Android studio, let's make
those changes to our listItem layout.

35
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:01,142
First I'm going to modify a linear
layout to change it orientation from

36
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:02,530
vertical to horizontal.

37
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,330
And then next I'm going to wrap
our two text views inside a new

38
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,930
vertical LinearLayout and
then add the closing tag.

39
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,550
Notice here in the new
LinearLayout I just added

40
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,510
that there is some
padding on the left here.

41
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,710
So 16 dbs of space between the text and
the image.

42
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,840
Now lets preview to see
what that looks like so

43
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,840
click the preview button over here.

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,430
So from the preview pane I can see
that the layout looks a lot better.

45
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,590
So we have the best icon on the left and
our two text views on our right.

46
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,040
Now let's go ahead and run the app on
our device and see what it looks like.

47
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,250
So first I want to close up
the preview pane and run our app.

48
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,110
So here's the current version of
the app running on our device now I'm

49
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,760
going to tap into the NumbersActivity perfect.

50
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,090
So it looks like a screenshot from the
quiz with our basket icon on the left

51
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,288
and showing for each list item.

52
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,980
Now, things aren't exactly looking
the same as our design marks but

53
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,300
we can worry about these little
details such as font size, colors, and

54
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,620
padding at the end of this lesson.
