1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,960
Status code is 302, and the

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:09,408
location header was this URL. Iana.org/domain/example.

3
00:00:09,408 --> 00:00:13,160
Okay, I'll work through how I find the answers and hopefully you

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,408
did something similar. So we go to our terminal and we said example.com. So

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:25,270
let's make that request, telnet to www.example.com. Port 80. Okay.

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:31,248
Now we say GET / HTTP/1.0. HOST,

7
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:36,170
www.example.com.

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,100
Uh-huh. Nice simple response. We can see our status code is 302. And we

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,880
can see our location header is right here, iana.org.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,520
If that didn't work, you know, here's how you do it. All right, so let's

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,300
let's play around a little bit more. So we

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,660
see that this is a redirect sponse, response because

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,910
of status code 302 and it's saying the actual

14
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,460
content is here. Let's give a shot at making

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,808
the request to find this. We're going telnet to

16
00:01:04,808 --> 00:01:07,924
iana.org and make a request for this path and

17
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:10,140
see how it goes. See if we can get

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,578
a 200. We make the request to iana.org. Telnet to

19
00:01:15,578 --> 00:01:20,300
www.iana.org port 80 and then we say get

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,544
slash. Domain slash example http slash 1.0.

21
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:30,414
Okay so here we are. You can see where I telnetted

22
00:01:30,414 --> 00:01:35,730
into Iana.org and you can see the request I made for

23
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,875
slash domain slash example. I used http 1.0 again. And you can see the response.

24
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,990
[LAUGH] This is actually kind of funny. So we

25
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,290
respond it with HTTP/1.1 status 200. This is actually a

26
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,000
good example of, you know, the web not aligning up

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,830
exactly correctly but that's how it goes. Generally, this 1.1

28
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,220
should have mashed this 1.0 but since these guys control

29
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,430
the web, I guess they can do whatever they like.

30
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,590
Okay, so you can see the common headers, dates You

31
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,980
know, today [LAUGH] actually today for me and the past

32
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:10,070
for you. You can see the server header, Apache

33
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,180
and you see it. This is an interesting how they're

34
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,890
last modified. This page was last modified over a

35
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,110
year ago. This is for caching purposes. This tells our

36
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,940
browser that we don't need to bother requesting this

37
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,010
page again, you know? We don't need new updates if

38
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,760
it hasn't changed since this date. Content type. This is

39
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,600
typical. Text HTML. And, below that, you see the content.

40
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,360
Pretty cool huh?
