1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,969
Let's try a programming quiz
where we'll use GDX app

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:08,680
to figure out what platform we're
running on and then log the result.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,270
Since this is the first programming quiz
in this class, I'll walk you through

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,640
the workflow you'll be following for
the rest of the class.

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,250
First, below the video,

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,750
you should see a link containing the URL
of the starter code for this quiz.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,150
In this case it's 2.1.02
exercise log application type.

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,840
All right, we've loaded up the exercise.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,800
So now the first thing to note
is that the root of this folder

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,600
contains a readme.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,510
It actually has a detailed description
of everything we've covered so

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,430
far in the course along with
instructions of how we're

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,750
going to complete this exercise.

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,410
So this says to open up the TODO pane
to find what we're suppose to do.

15
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,380
Looks like there's four TODO's and
two different files.

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,460
If we open up one of these folders.

17
00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:55,350
That's actually this TODO
in the README itself.

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,700
If we open up this one,

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,020
this looks like what we're suppose to
be accomplishing in this exercise.

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,510
Let's open it up.

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,270
All right, first thing,

22
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,630
we're supposed to give our
application listener a log tag.

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,620
Well, we want the tag to be public,
static, and final.

24
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:16,510
It's a string named tag and it's value
is logging demo, class, getname.

25
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,030
All right,
that's one to-do accomplished.

26
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,470
Let's look at the next.

27
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,050
All right, the next few to-do's are us
Gdx.app to find out what application

28
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,630
type we're running, and
then use Gdx.app to log the result.

29
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,870
Well, I think I can actually
do those together in one line.

30
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,422
We'll start with Gdx.app log,
passed in the tag,

31
00:01:32,422 --> 00:01:36,782
provide some description of
what we're talking about, then,

32
00:01:36,782 --> 00:01:41,930
to get the application type,
we can just use Gdx.app getType.

33
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,290
Now, if we run this application
we get the nice log message

34
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,390
we're running on desktop.

35
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,950
All right, give this a try yourself.

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,592
And also try running it on
Android to see of Gdx.app

37
00:01:52,592 --> 00:01:55,900
is accurately reporting
its application type.

38
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,430
Remember to follow the Todos
in the starter code and

39
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,560
take a look at the solution
code if you run into trouble
