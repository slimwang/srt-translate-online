1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,250
The first assignment you can chose to do for this course is to talk about how

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,040
these semantic networks can be used to represent Raven's Progressive Matrices.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,920
We saw a few different problems in the first lesson. So take a look at how

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,040
the semantic networks we've talked about today can be used to represent some of

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,620
those other problems, and write your own kind of representation scheme.

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,590
In addition to writing a representation scheme, also talk about how that

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,270
representation scheme actually enables problem solving. Remember what Ashok

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,010
mentioned about the different qualities of a good knowledge representation that

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,560
is complete. It captures information at the right level of abstraction, and

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,130
it enables problem solving. So write how your representation can enable problem

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,580
solving of two by one, two by two, and three by three problems. You don't need

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,830
to use the exact same representation scheme that we use, and in fact you can and

13
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,660
should use your own. Also remember that your representation should not capture

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,630
any details about what the actual answer to the problem is, but rather it

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,520
should only capture what's actually in the figures in the particular problem.
