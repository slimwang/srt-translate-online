1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,075
We need to change where the counter variable starts. Because now we want it to

2
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:07,644
start at 20. We want to stop if the counter is less than zero, so we'll need to

3
00:00:07,644 --> 00:00:12,646
change the direction of the sign. And we want the variable i to go down every

4
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:18,100
time instead of up, so we replace plus plus with minus minus. Now, for the

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,089
finishing touches. And if I run the program, it goes like this. Those days

6
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:25,476
counted down a little fast, but that's okay for now. But that's okay. Now you

7
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:26,820
now how to count down.
