00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,800
The specific objectives
of this lesson are for

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,170
you to learn about the relationship
that exists between images and videos.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,220
We will talk about the whole
concept of persistence of vision.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,110
because, that is the key process that
helps us understand how we can actually

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:21,440
play videos, and see a flicker free
motion of things moving around in video.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,990
We'll talk about the whole
concept of how filtering and

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,040
all the things that we
have learned about images.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,290
How can they be applied to video?

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,810
And then we'll talk a little bit
about how we can actually do

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,740
feature detection to tracking and
all of that stuff in video.
