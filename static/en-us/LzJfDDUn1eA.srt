So the way to submit this answer on the forum,

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,470
is to look under the Discussions section of the web

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,000
page. For now, there is just the one link here.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,840
Although, you may see multiple links under Discussions. Click on the

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,200
link that is in bold, and has a star in

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,620
front of it. Now, the star means that I created

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,340
this thread for you to submit your responses. After I

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,790
click on it, a new tab opens with a Discussion forum.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,920
Here, you can simply scroll down, to submit your responses. So here I am,

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,100
back to the original question, which is, if you were writing the take a break

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,440
program, what steps would you take to get to the output? Make sure you submit

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,060
your responses on the Discussion forum, and,

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,320
check this box after you've submitted your answer.
