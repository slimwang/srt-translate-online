00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,371
Since graph A is exactly the same as this function except flipped across the

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:09,918
x-axis, it represents a reflection of f of x in the x-axis. Graph B is

3
00:00:09,918 --> 00:00:14,800
identical to f of x, except flipped across the y-axis. So, it represents a

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,378
reflection in the y-axis. Cool. We have all sorts of mirror images all over the

5
00:00:19,378 --> 00:00:20,279
place.
