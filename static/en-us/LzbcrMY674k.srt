1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For the first one, Python is fun, there is a space here and a space there.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There will be three elements in the return list--Python, is, and fun.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This next one reminds us that split only splits on spaces.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We might be tempted to break up July and August,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but the split function won't.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There are only two elements of the return list--"July-August" and "1842."

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Finally, down here we might like to break this up into 6 times 9 equals 42,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but officially there are no spaces in this string.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We'll just get out a singleton list--a list containing one element, the original string.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
"July-August 1842" is probably within a year of when Ada Lovelace wrote

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the first computer program for the difference engine or analytic engine at the time.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It was to compute some mathematics.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Also, if you're not sure why 6 times 9 would be 42--don't panic.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,212
But you may want to check out the works of Douglas Adams.
