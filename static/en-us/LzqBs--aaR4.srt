1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,210
A quick visualization of this should show you that,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:07,100
of course, I'm going from gray values to, pretty fast to white values here.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,760
Of course, that would be a positive gradient here.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,000
These two are actually in, in the wrong direction.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,660
This one is the name, same direction except that it's going from.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,053
It does have a gradient change in this direction, but

7
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:20,654
of course it's a negative change.

8
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,614
And if you were to look at this in absolute manner,

9
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:24,725
this would have been also a fine direction to choose.

10
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,787
But, in the real relative direction,

11
00:00:26,787 --> 00:00:30,460
this would be the one where we're going from dark to bright.

12
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,970
So, the right answer, of course, is this one.
