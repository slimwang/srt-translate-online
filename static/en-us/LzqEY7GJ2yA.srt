00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,730
So, to quickly summarize this lecture, I basically used image smoothing as

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,320
an example to teach you about how we can actually do neighborhood-based.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,700
Ways of actually taking information from the pixel neighborhoods to be able to

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,840
impart smoothing functions or

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,150
filtering functions at a new point in the pixel to create new images.

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,870
Use that as a format to kind of introduce a concept of kernel and

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,020
smoothing over an image using a kernel, and, basically,

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,630
show how we can do averaging and median filtering.

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,910
The intention, of course, was to, to show you how we can actually do

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,570
neighborhood types of processing, beyond simple pixel processing,

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,470
to be able to achieve simple filtering approaches on images.

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,990
Now, what we will do is I did introduce the concept of cross-correlation.

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,280
We will now start looking at cross-correlation and

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,330
another method called convolution.

15
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,260
To help us understand more how we can do simple image processing.

16
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,280
Again, the goal has been for us to look at intuitively, how this all works.

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,270
Because as we go towards and try to start doing higher levels of efforts and

18
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,470
computational photography.

19
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,550
These will be the foundational blocks we will be picking up on

20
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,400
to learn about how we can do image processing and computer vision applications.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,030
Just again want to thank people that I've borrowed information from.
