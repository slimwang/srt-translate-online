1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now the mean is obviously 50, 0.5<i>100, the variance will be 25, 100</i>0.25.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But as we divide the variance by now 10,000, we get 0.0025.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The square root of that happens to be 0.05

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and multiplying with this magic number 1.96 gives us 0.098.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The way we read this is if after a 100 coin flips we observed, perhaps empirically,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that the probability of heads is 50%, there is still an approximate Â±10% confidence interval.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So we are really certain it'll fall between 40% and 60%, but in between we're not that certain.
