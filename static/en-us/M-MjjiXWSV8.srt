When our sensory neurons are activated, what occurs? Remember our sensory

2
00:00:04,656 --> 00:00:10,560
neurons are important for receiving incoming information from our senses.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,520
Touch, taste, smell and hearing. The sensory neurons carry signals from the

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,180
peripheral nervous system to the outer parts of the body to tell us how we

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:25,030
feel. The sensory neurons will carry signals from our senses to our central

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:30,385
nervous system. Or the sensory neurons will carry signals to the motor neurons,

7
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:34,129
which then send that message to the brain.
