You might have taken some different approaches to find the least common

2
00:00:03,732 --> 00:00:07,850
denominator. Here is one way, we could have used the least common multiple. By

3
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:11,809
listing the multiples of 7 and by listing the multiples of 8, we can see that

4
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:15,982
the lowest common number that they go into is 56. But this is a lot of work, and

5
00:00:15,994 --> 00:00:19,795
I don't want to have to do this every single time. So, let's try using our

6
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:23,551
factor tree. The only common factor of 8 and 7 is 1 and the numbers on the

7
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:28,618
outside must be 8 and 7, since 8 times 1 is 8 and 7 times 1 is 7. If we multiply

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,869
these factors together, we get 56. Well done if you got 56.
