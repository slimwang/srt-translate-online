00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,698
Here, the dimensions of the rectangle are 8 inches by 4 inches. Great thinking

2
00:00:04,698 --> 00:00:09,423
if you found these numbers. We begin solving by starting with an equation for

3
00:00:09,423 --> 00:00:14,352
the perimeter and the equation for the area. We know the value of the perimeter

4
00:00:14,352 --> 00:00:20,270
here. The perimeter is 24 inches, so we can replace P with 24. For the area

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,420
equation, we know A equals l times w. We can replace it this value of A with

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,484
its numerical value, 32. Now that we have these two equations, we want to solve

7
00:00:30,484 --> 00:00:35,613
this one for the value of l. So we can use substitution to solve. We'll divide

8
00:00:35,613 --> 00:00:39,393
each term by 2 to get 12 equals l plus w, and then we'll subtract w from both

9
00:00:39,393 --> 00:00:45,665
sides to get 12 minus w equals l. And now, here comes the substitution. We

10
00:00:45,665 --> 00:00:51,353
replace l with this expression, 12 minus w here. We multiply each term in the

11
00:00:51,353 --> 00:00:58,062
parentheses by w to get 32 equals 12w minus w squared. Then, to solve this

12
00:00:58,062 --> 00:01:01,968
quadratic, we move these terms to the opposite side of the equation to set it

13
00:01:01,968 --> 00:01:07,902
equal to 0. We factor this quadratic by finding factors at positive 32 at sum

14
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:13,655
to negative 12. Those factors are negative 8 and negative 4. And finally, we

15
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:18,840
set each factor equal to 0, so w can equal positive 8 or w can equal positive

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,423
4. We know the width should be the shorter dimension, so that will be 4 and our

17
00:01:23,423 --> 00:01:28,408
length would be 8. Our unit of measurement is in inches on all sides and we can

18
00:01:28,408 --> 00:01:34,503
quickly check to verify the perimeter and area for our problem. If we add up

19
00:01:34,503 --> 00:01:39,890
all the sides around the object, we'll get 24 inches. So yes, that checks with

20
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:45,860
our original problem. And if we multiply the length times the width, 8 times 4

21
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:51,626
equals 32 inches squared, which was our original area. Now, it's okay if you

22
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:54,990
didn't get all of this, but hopefully, you made your way at least to the

23
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,450
factoring. Great job if so.
