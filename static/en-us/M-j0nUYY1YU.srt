Hi! In the previous units, you've seen how to do simulations of systems that develop in time

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but where we've got some more dimensions--the x, y and z of space.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This unit introduces differential equations that govern time and space.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We'll use the computer to model combustion and the propagation of heat

5
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to predict the cause of a wildfire.
