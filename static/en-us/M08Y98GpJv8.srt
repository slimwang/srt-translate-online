00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,144
Mental disorders are much more common than many of us think. Almost half of us

2
00:00:04,144 --> 00:00:08,671
will experience a mental disorder at some time in our lifetime. According to

3
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:13,073
the main guide for clinical psychologists, the DSM-5, diagnosing mental

4
00:00:13,073 --> 00:00:17,404
disorders involves all four of the four D's: Disturbance, Dysfunction,

5
00:00:17,404 --> 00:00:23,410
Distress, and Deviance. There are many different categories of disorders but

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,450
some of the major ones are those experienced in childhood. Like autism spectrum

7
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,590
or ADHD. Mood disorders, such as anxiety disorders, depression, and bipolar

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:38,343
disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorders. Post-traumatic stress disorder.

9
00:00:38,343 --> 00:00:44,152
Dissociative disorders. Bodily-somatic disorders. Personality disorders. And,

10
00:00:44,152 --> 00:00:49,170
finally, the major thought disorder known as schizophrenia. Now, remember, a

11
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,265
very important point about disorders is that there is a range from normal to

12
00:00:53,265 --> 00:00:58,755
dysfunctional. And everyone experiences everyday forms of these, but they're

13
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:02,850
not necessarily actually disorders unless they have all four of those D's:

14
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,400
Disturbance, Dysfunction, Distress, and Deviance.
