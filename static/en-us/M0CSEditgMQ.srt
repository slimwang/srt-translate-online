00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,478
We know for our ratio the number of dimes to quarters is 2 to 3 or 2 3rd. 2 is

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,527
the number of dimes, so I need the number of dimes is in the numerator on the

3
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:12,517
other side. I need to make sure the units match. I don't know the number of

4
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:16,566
dimes, so I'm going to call that d. And 231 would go in the denominator, for the

5
00:00:16,578 --> 00:00:20,894
number of quarters. Again, notice that the quarters are both in the denominator.

6
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:25,942
There's other ways to set up this proportion. Just be sure you're consistent

7
00:00:25,954 --> 00:00:30,687
with your units. Now, we can solve this proportion using cross multiplication.

8
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:35,278
I'm going to multiply both sides of the equation by the denominators. The 3s

9
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,901
will reduce to 1, and the 231s will also reduce to 1. This leaves me with 231

10
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:45,301
times 2, which is 462 and 3 times d, or 3d. Finally, we divide by 3 and we get

11
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:50,922
154. Really great work if you got that one right. And even if you got it right

12
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:56,078
or wrong, try solving this a different way. See if you can set up other

13
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,718
proportions and get the same answer.
