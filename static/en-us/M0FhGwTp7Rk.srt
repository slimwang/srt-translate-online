1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,170
David, what did you come up with?

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,480
>> From the beginning,
we start with A or something.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,170
So as long as A is true,
then we know the result is true.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,430
We don't even care about the rest of it.

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,785
When A is false,
then we need to look at B and the not C.

6
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:18,278
Because this is an and, we need
both B and not C to both be true.

7
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:21,295
So, when B is false, we can go ahead and
say this is false over here.

8
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:25,745
And when not C is false, we can go
ahead and say this is false over here.

9
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:28,925
Not C is false, if C is true,
so this is also false.

10
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:32,055
So, our only other answer that's
true is that row right there.

11
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:36,790
>> So, as you can see, this can
become very complicated very quickly.

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,540
But David did get the answer to the
truth value of this particular sentence,

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,340
based on the truth
values of the predicates

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,680
that are inside the sentences.

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,840
So in principle now, we can see how we
can compute the truth value of very,

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,960
very complicated sentences
returning logic.
