[Norvig] So here's 1 approach. First we'll define the houses.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Say there's 5 houses. That was the number 1 thing stated in the problem.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Then we'll say orderings is some collection of possible orderings of the houses,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
so [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] would be 1 element of orderings,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
[2, 1, 3, 4, 5] would be another element and so on

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And then we just use a for statement to iterate the 5 variables in the property group

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
through all the possible orderings and then put in our code here.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The question is, what is this function F that gives us all the orderings?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Is it the permutation function, the combinations function, the factorial function,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or something else?
