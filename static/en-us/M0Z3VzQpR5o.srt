00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,230
In the quiz before this one, we said that if we wanted to increase each

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,875
potential wiper set price by $4, we should replace c with c plus 4. So that's

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:13,794
exactly what I've done. In our new equation, everywhere we had the quantity c in

4
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:18,228
the old equation, we now have a c plus 4. Note that we need to insert c plus 4

5
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:23,119
with parentheses around it so that whatever operator was applied to c applies to

6
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,303
both parts of c and of 4. Now, we just need to simplify this expression. After a

7
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:36,193
few steps, we finally get to a final equation of p equals negative 200 c squared

8
00:00:36,193 --> 00:00:38,780
plus 18,400 c minus 133,200.
