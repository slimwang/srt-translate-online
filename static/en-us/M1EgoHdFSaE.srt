1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,955
Yes, we would trust the results more because we're holding one of these factors

2
00:00:04,968 --> 00:00:09,955
constant. When more factors are held constant, the test is more reliable because

3
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:14,682
these conditions are the same for all people that took the test. We always have

4
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:19,452
to think about extraneous factors, things that can impact the outcome that we

5
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:24,537
may not have thought about. These extraneous factors can impact the outcome, in

6
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:29,264
this case, our memory. These extraneous factors are often called lurking

7
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:34,229
variables. They just lurk around waiting to ambush your results. It's really

8
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:39,453
difficult to account for every possible extraneous factor. But this is something

9
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:44,138
to be aware of, not only as you're going through this course, but when you

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,205
analyze data in your daily lives.
