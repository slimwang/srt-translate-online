1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,360
Health information exchange is essential
for care coordination, managing

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,990
populations of patients, public health
and aggregating data for research.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,510
However, there are still many challenges
that have proven hard to overcome,

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,910
despite years of effort.

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,740
Perhaps most importantly, it's difficult
to establish a sustainable business

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,720
model beyond the confines
of a healthcare enterprise,

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,080
which has its own proprietary business
reasons for supporting an HIE.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,480
There's also the inevitable trade-off
between functionality and cost.

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,380
Centralized models like IHIE deal
with data interoperability issues and

10
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,000
can provide extensive services,
but at a high cost.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,140
New virtually free models, like Direct,
are not yet providing services

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,100
nearly as rich as IHIE, but we've
discussed how that might be changing.
