1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,795
To answer this question, let's compare
the two so that you can choose.

2
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:08,620
LinearLayouts are great for
aligning views in rows or columns.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,840
They're a good way to divide up
one space using layout weights

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,590
that will expand or shrink views
depending on the size of the display.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,615
On the other hand,
RelativeLayouts are great for

6
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:20,200
positioning elements
relative to one another.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,450
For example, putting B below A, or
putting C in the lower left-hand corner.

8
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:28,600
RelativeLayouts also make
it easy to overlap views.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,551
For example,
here view A is overlapping view B.

10
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:35,545
For our card, we don't really have
a line of horizontal or vertical views.

11
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:38,169
And as you can see,
some of these views overlap.

12
00:00:38,169 --> 00:00:41,686
So in this case,
a RelativeLayout makes a lot more sense.

13
00:00:41,686 --> 00:00:43,109
And with a RelativeLayout,

14
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:47,080
I can use specific attributes
to position these two TextViews.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,230
Instead of talking about
all that here though,

16
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,480
you'll tell me what do in
the next few questions.
