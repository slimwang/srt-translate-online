1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,290
Memory check.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,780
If lambda 1 and lambda 2 are the two
eigenvalues of gradients in a region,

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,200
when do you think that region
is good for tracking motion?

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,360
That is, when do the optical
flow equations become solvable?

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,200
Is it when lambda 1 and
lambda 2 are small or

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,680
when lambda 1 is much
greater than lambda 2?

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,600
How about the opposite?

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,580
That is lambda 2 is much
greater than lambda 1,

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,570
say an order of a magnitude larger.

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,495
How about when they're of comparable
magnitude and sufficiently large?

11
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:39,295
Remember, select the cases where the
optical flow equations become solvable.

12
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:42,015
That is, you get definitive values for
u and v.
