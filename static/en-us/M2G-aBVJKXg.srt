1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is the second choice. The first choice doesn't make any sense at all.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The difference between the second choice and the third choice is whether we use

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the encryption function or decryption.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The reason that we're using encryption function just like we did in encrypting

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
is because when we're decrypting we have these cipher text,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we're trying to get the messages, so we're just trying to go through these XORs

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
in the reverse direction.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That means we need the same exact thing that we had in encryption to XOR out,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which is the result of encrypting these Xi values.
