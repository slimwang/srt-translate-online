1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] And the answer is -15.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If you look at the pure motion cost for the short route, there are 6 steps.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So we wanted to turn left.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You pay the penalty of -6.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The longer route is 14 steps, and we add a penalty of -6 for 3 right turns.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Each is -2. That gives us -20.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If we penalize left turns with -15, then the total will be -21,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
which is smaller or higher cost, so to speak, than the alternative route

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that we wish to favor.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
For anything larger than -15, we either have a tie or we just go the shortcut,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
so that's the correct number over here.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It was a really nontrivial question. I'm really proud if you got this right.
