00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,160
Thanks so much for

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,920
giving us that extra insight into
how you use websites Victor.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,790
>> Sure my pleasure.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,780
>> If you could have our students take
away just two things from this lesson

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:09,370
what would they be?

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,190
>> First of all make sure to
use meaningful headings and

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,250
link text as well as good pay structure.

8
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,930
Secondly, as a general rule,
you shouldn't try to control

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,370
the experience a screen
reader user will have.

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,130
They will use the information
available to them

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,370
because the tool they're using to find
that information on the web page.

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,980
Things such as trying to control or fine
tune exactly what a screen reader says,

13
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,780
or make an elements focusable
which shouldn't be,

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,720
generally lead to more confusion and
worse experience for users.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,360
>> That's really helpful
advice thank you.

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,023
Now and our next lesson, we're going to
take a look at what we can do if HTML

17
00:00:54,023 --> 00:00:57,932
doesn't have the precise semantic we
need or if, for some reason or other,

18
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:01,811
the HTML element we'd usually use isn't
a good fit for some other reason.

19
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,099
