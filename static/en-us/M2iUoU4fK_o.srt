00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,660
We introduce QRDA, the standard for
query results, in lesson eight.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,910
You should recall that the results can
be reported at three levels of detail.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,560
The patient level,
a list of patients, or

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,260
an aggregated level across
a group of patients.

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,500
In this example of QRDA XML,

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,170
two templates are utilized
to specify NQF

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:31,070
defined quality measures for
inpatient asthma care and

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,020
the use of systemic corticosteroids for
inpatient asthma patients.

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,980
Each of which, of course,
has its own complex definition.
