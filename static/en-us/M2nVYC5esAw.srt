00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,857
To do this, we would find the squared deviation of each value from their

2
00:00:03,857 --> 00:00:11,230
respective mean. 1.5 minus 1.5 squared, plus 1.3 minus 1.5 squared, plus 1.8

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:21,725
minus 1.5 squared, etcetera. All the way to 2.7 minus 2.875 squared. This gives

4
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:23,215
us 0.836.
