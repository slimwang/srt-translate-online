1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,310
Now, let's discuss
Stateful Inspection Firewall.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,140
This is different from
Packet Filtering Firewall.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,592
In a Stateful Inspection Firewall,
a packet is analyzed and

4
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:13,230
a decision is made based on
the context of other related packets.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,130
Typically, this means the connection
this packet belongs to.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,140
Therefor we need to record and
maintain information about connections.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,920
And then decisions are made on each
packet based on the current state of

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,020
the connection and the context of
the packet within this connection.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,140
More specifically as the packet
arrives at the firewall,

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,620
the firewall updates the information
about a connection accordingly and then

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,620
decides whether the packet is allowed
in the context of the connection.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,580
For example, for

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,030
inbound packet, there is part of
an established email connection.

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,360
The firewall can check that the inbound
packet is a response to a previously

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,720
outbound packet.

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,150
In addition, the firewall can resemble
multiple packets of the connection and

17
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,300
inspect the connection data such
as the exact FTP commands or

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,450
which file the FTP is transmitting.

19
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,340
Or the firewall can actually look
into the page contents received from

20
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,010
a web server.
