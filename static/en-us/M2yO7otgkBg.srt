1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,540
For this trinomial, we want to find factors of a hundred, that sum to negative

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,023
20. We get the hundred from multiplying 25 times four. These are the factor

3
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:14,000
pairs for positive 100. But remember that this is positive 100, and I have a

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,667
negative 20 down here. We need to find factors of positive 100 that sum to

5
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:22,712
negative 20. This must mean that our factor pair must contain two negative

6
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:27,312
numbers. So negative ten and negative ten must be the answers here. They

7
00:00:27,312 --> 00:00:32,952
multiply to give us positive 100 and they sum to negative 20. But before I go to

8
00:00:32,952 --> 00:00:37,405
do this step, I should have asked myself first, is there a GCF here? Well two

9
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:41,461
doesn't go into every number because this one's not even. They don't all share

10
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:46,690
an x, and there's no other common factors for 4, 20 and 25 besides one, so I can

11
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,582
continue factoring as usual. We can factor 5x from the first two terms and a

12
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:56,910
negative two from the second two terms. Completing my factoring by grouping, I

13
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,945
have 5x minus 2 times 5x minus 2. Since it's factors repeated, I can simply

14
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:06,514
write it with a square. Here's my complete factored form. Some of you might have

15
00:01:06,514 --> 00:01:10,894
taken a shortcut. You might have recognized this as a special pattern. Our first

16
00:01:10,894 --> 00:01:15,488
term and our last term are perfect squares. So this fits our perfect square

17
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:21,430
trinomial pattern. We can just write out answer as 5x minus 2 squared. The a is

18
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,744
5x and the b is 2.
