1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,400
The foreign key constraint keeps
the link between the tables

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,630
by preventing invalid data from being
inserted into the foreign key column,

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,540
because the value has to be
one of the values contained in

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,670
the table the constraint points to.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,750
Well, what does this mean for testing?

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,990
It means that we cannot test the weather
table without having the location table,

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,450
because the foreign key constraint
enforces that the location ID is a valid

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,650
ID in the location table.

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,630
It also means that we have to use
the result of an insert in the location

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,550
table in order to insert
in the weather table.

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,450
In other words,

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,650
the weather table cannot be unit tested
independently from the location table.

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,030
We are going to be writing
a database test for sunshine,

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,040
which will have to
work with a constraint.
