00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,816
Leading up the, the last quiz, we already had a lot of information about our

2
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:07,881
situation. And we'd also picked out what really mattered to us. In terms of how

3
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:11,797
we need to go about finding the cost to make one wiper set. In the last quiz, we

4
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:15,725
added one more piece of information to this list. And I'm going to write that

5
00:00:15,737 --> 00:00:19,971
out a little bit more formally now. We decided that we would represent this

6
00:00:19,983 --> 00:00:24,352
quantity right here, the cost to make one wiper set, by a variable. I'm going to

7
00:00:24,364 --> 00:00:28,460
pick the letter c for that variable. C is going to equal the cost to make 1

8
00:00:28,472 --> 00:00:32,741
wiper set. To move one step closer to having a formal mathematical equation to

9
00:00:32,753 --> 00:00:36,845
describe our situation, I'd like to help us get some other numbers in our

10
00:00:36,857 --> 00:00:41,466
equation. Looking at this given information up here, can you tell me two numbers

11
00:00:41,478 --> 00:00:45,797
that equal, respectively, the cost to make 92 wiper sets, and the number of

12
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,755
wiper sets that are made. This is going to help us with substitution, in the

13
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:48,755
next step of the process.
