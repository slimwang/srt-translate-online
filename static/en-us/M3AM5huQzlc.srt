1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And finally, I would like to know what's the value of

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
C1, the figure down here, after we ran value iteration

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
over and over again all the way to a convergence.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Again, gamma equals 1. State transition function is deterministic.
