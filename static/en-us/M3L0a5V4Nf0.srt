1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In truth table-speak, there are 6 outcomes, 1 to 6.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Each has the same probability over six.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Half of those numbers are even--2, 4, and 6,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
so if we add those up, we get 3 * 1/6--the same as a half.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The outcomes is 0.5.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now I'm finally going to make, as my final quiz,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
a really challenging question for you.
