00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,586
Well, we know 1 hour and 4 minutes would be hour and 4 60ths of an hour. 4

2
00:00:05,586 --> 00:00:09,994
minutes is just 4 60ths of an hour, since an hour can be broken up into 60

3
00:00:09,994 --> 00:00:15,392
minutes. 4 60ths simplifies to 1 15th, since there's a common factor of four

4
00:00:15,392 --> 00:00:20,464
and the numerator and in the denominator. And then finally to add these two

5
00:00:20,464 --> 00:00:27,084
numbers together, we can change one to be 15 15th. This gives us a total sum of

6
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:29,138
16 15ths hours.
