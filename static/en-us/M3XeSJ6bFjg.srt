00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,280
Only packet monitoring can provide timing information

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,620
on a packet level, or packet headers.

00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:11,110
But both methods can actually provide the number of bytes in each flow. By

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:16,820
definition, flow records record the number of bytes in each flow as an aggregate

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,850
statistic. But if you had packet-level information,

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,180
you could, of course, compute the statistic yourself.
