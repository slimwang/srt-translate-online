00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,270
The million dollar question that,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,452
every developer has to ask themselves
is, where do I put my breakpoints?

3
00:00:06,452 --> 00:00:11,210
Defining breakpoints based on specific
devices, products, brand names or

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,150
anything else, will almost always
result in a maintenance nightmare.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,360
You never know what next
hot device will be or

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,450
what will be hot two years from now.

7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,110
>> Instead, look at the content
to find the right breakpoints.

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,640
Scott Yale said it best.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,640
We shouldn't choose break points at all.

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,920
Instead, we should find them,
using our content as a guide.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,800
Pete, I would love to get some insight,
into the choices that you

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,830
make when you're trying to decide,
what breakpoints to use on a page.

13
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:37,550
>> Sure.

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,100
Let's take a look.
