00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,775
So now let's calculate the deviation from mean by subtracting the mean from

2
00:00:03,775 --> 00:00:14,890
each of these values. So, the first one here would be 33,219 minus $52,793.80.

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,095
Just to practice, enter a few deviations from the mean. Remember, some of these

4
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:20,430
might be negative.
