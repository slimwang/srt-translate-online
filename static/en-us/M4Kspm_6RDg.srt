00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,080
The acronyms API get's thrown around
a lot in the computer science community,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,300
but what is an API and
why is it so important?

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,060
Well, APIs
are Application Programming Interfaces

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,220
refer to any method of communication
between two entities of code.

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,010
You can think of APIs as
connection points in code

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,810
that allow one application
to talk to another.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,780
When you copy code from a browser and

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,240
paste it into a word
processing application,

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,480
an API inside your computer helped
make that transfer of data happen.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,970
If you listen to music on your computer,
like with Itunes or

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,640
Spotify, the music-playing application
communicated with your operating

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,435
system's API in order to send
that music to your speakers.

13
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:42,480
APIs are a great way for
controlling the exposure of code,

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,140
allowing internal functionalities
of an application to be used

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,888
from the outside world without
exposing all of the internal code.

16
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:51,230
Companies that want to keep
their code bases private,

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,500
like the makers of Microsoft Windows or
Mac OS X,

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,070
use APIs to make it possible for their
applications to still have interactions

19
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,340
with other applications without
having to reveal the actual code.

20
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,070
Even for open source code projects, like
the Ubuntu operating system, APIs make

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,300
easy entry points to code that other
developers will most frequently use.
