1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,560
We are going to consider
multiple starting points for

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,084
the Hill Climbing
algorithm in this quiz.

3
00:00:05,084 --> 00:00:07,640
By convention,
we'll call these particles.

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:11,050
So for each of these particles, tell us
their value, assuming your algorithm has

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,600
a step size of 1 and that it stops
when no positive gradient is found.
