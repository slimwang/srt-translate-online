00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,689
Analogical reasoning allows us to look at new problems in terms of familiar

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:10,170
problems. It also allows us to transfer knowledge from familiar problems

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,240
to new problems. A hierarchy process of analogical reasoning is shown here.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,900
It consists of five major phases, retrieval, mapping, transfer,

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,520
evaluation, and storage. We'll discuss all five stages, in detail.

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,120
Let us compare for a moment, the process for an illogical reasoning in general,

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,290
with a process for, case based reasoning, within domain and

8
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,690
illogical reasoning that we discussed earlier. Notice that retrieval,

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,410
evaluation, and storage, are common between the two processes.

10
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,130
In case based reasoning the target problem and this first case,

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,870
were from the same domain. They had the same kind of relationships, and

12
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,060
the same kind of objects. We simply had to adapt the source case to address

13
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,400
the target properly. An analogical reasoning in general, the target form and

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,990
the source case need not be from the same domain.

15
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,240
When they are not from the same domain, we can't just take the source codes and

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,650
adapt it. We first have to map the target problem with the source case that is,

17
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,740
we need to address the correspondence problem. What in the target problem,

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,540
corresponds to what in this source case as an example? The laser beam and

19
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,620
the target Duncker's radiation problem corresponds to the rebel army in

20
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,560
the source case. Once we have mapped the conceptual relationship in the target

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,810
problem to the conceptual relationships in the source case, then, we can try

22
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,250
to transfer some of the relationships in the source case to the target problem.

23
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,449
We can first abstract those relationships and then transfer them to

24
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:40,072
the target problem. As an example, the Duncker's radiation problem we

25
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:43,918
first did the alignment, that is, we just did the correspondence problem,

26
00:01:43,918 --> 00:01:47,251
what in the target [UNKNOWN] corresponds to what in the source case?

27
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:52,349
Then we took the relationship, and abstructed it. The relationship in that

28
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:57,019
case was, take the resource and decompose it into several smaller resources, and

29
00:01:57,019 --> 00:02:01,535
send them to the goal at the same location. That particular relationship, that

30
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:06,204
particular pattern, is what we abstracted and transferred to the target problem.

31
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:09,812
Note that this is just one theory of analogical reasoning. In other theories,

32
00:02:09,812 --> 00:02:14,038
some of these boxes are configured differently. For example, in another theory,

33
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:18,420
mapping is a part of retrieval. We do mapping in order to do retrieval.
