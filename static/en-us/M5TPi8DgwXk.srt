1
00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:09,899
As we expand from left to the right, we go to the middle node over here, and then we expand the first leaf, the second, and the third.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,266
And we pass back as the current min, four.

3
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:21,432
As we now move into the second node over here, you first expand five, which might leave a larger max.

4
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:29,532
But as we hit two and expand it, we realize that this node over here will have a min of two or smaller,

5
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:35,966
and as a result, it can't contribute to the max anymore, so we cut it off and we never expand one.

6
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:42,566
Finally, as we move to the right side, the moment we hit one, we're done, because we know the max could be four,

7
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:53,333
but this branch over here will yield no value larger than one, so you're going back and never expand the nodes on the right side over here.
