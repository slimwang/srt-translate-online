00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:06,170
So far, in this course, we have considered software architectures.

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,310
Today, I would like to get into one particular kind of software architecture,

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:16,540
the architecture for distributed systems. And all this means is there's multiple

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:22,271
computers involved in providing whatever application technology system it's

5
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:28,790
supposed to. Moreover, we will consider heterogeneous distributed systems.

6
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,420
Systems in which the different computers are different kinds and

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:38,340
provide different capabilities. An example of this is a typical client server

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,080
system for example, insurance agents go out into the field,

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,480
they come to your house, they talk to you about various insurance options, and

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,570
they have their laptops. The laptops are connected to some server machine that,

11
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,440
understands the different forms you have to fill out, and the and

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,020
the rates involved in those in those particular contracts. And

13
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:08,280
ultimately if you sign up for a particular policy then the business

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,730
logic connects to a data base that stores the information about you and

15
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:17,720
your particular policy arrangements. In that particular situation,

16
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,710
there was a a database server machine, there was a web server

17
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:28,490
that was responsible for initiating and computing business logic.

18
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,520
And there were various web browsers running on laptop machines,

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,900
one for each agent. We'd like to look a little bit more in

20
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,500
how these particular kinds of systems are architected.
