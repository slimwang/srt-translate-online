Because Grids doesn't need the full power of web audio, we want to create a

2
00:00:03,695 --> 00:00:08,820
wrapper to hide all the potential complexity. What we really want is a simple

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,372
node graph consisting of the gain node that adjusts the volume. We want to keep

4
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:18,337
track of that, the audio context, and all the sound effects that are currently

5
00:00:18,337 --> 00:00:23,610
playing. Can you try to fill out the provided sound manager class with that

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,170
functionality? It should only be about three or four lines of code.
