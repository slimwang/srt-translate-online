1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,700
I hate to tell you this.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,410
You did not get it correct.

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:04,970
>> But let- >> So what did I do wrong?

4
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:05,670
>> Yeah, let me tell you.

5
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,880
So, when you're looking at the, at the new example,

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,980
you have to figure what parts of it to be paying attention to.

7
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,060
We call these features.

8
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,370
So a feature might be the color.

9
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,200
It might be- >> Like, white.

10
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,370
>> How many legs it has.

11
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:16,920
>> Four.

12
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,300
>> It might be whether it has horns or antlers.

13
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,340
>> Oh.

14
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,130
So a horse does not have horns or antlers.

15
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,670
>> You're right. >> But these all have horns and antlers and that's what-

16
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,410
>> I see. >> Acerous means,

17
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,510
is that it's lacking horns or antlers, antennae, things like that.

18
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,490
So that's why a horse would be a, an, an example of an acerous animal.

19
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,180
>> Okay.

20
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,010
>> And this is, in general, what machine learning is going to be doing is we

21
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,720
give you a bunch of examples and each one has a number of features,

22
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,040
a number of attributes that you can use to describe it.

23
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,680
And if you can pick out the right feature and

24
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,930
it's giving you the right information then you can,

25
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,760
you can classify new examples.

26
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,270
So a smart machine algorithm would have outperformed me?

27
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,870
>> I think so yeah.

28
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:51,600
>> Darn so let's,

29
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,820
don't take this class because I don't want all you guys to outperform me.

30
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,800
>> Well no I wouldn't go that far.

31
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,440
I think the way to think about it is what's the way that we

32
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,340
could use machine learning algorithm to get problems like this right and

33
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,600
that's the whole point of this lesson.

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,099
>> Okay
