00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,542
So here's a pseudo co-description of an algorithm that follows what we did as

2
00:00:04,542 --> 00:00:07,538
humans. Now let's think about this a little more carefully. So the questions is;

3
00:00:07,538 --> 00:00:11,046
Should we go ahead and implement this algorithm? Are we close enough to start

4
00:00:11,046 --> 00:00:14,202
writing the actual python code? There are four choices. First is that yes, we

5
00:00:14,202 --> 00:00:17,280
should go ahead and implement this, and we'll end up with the correct solution.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,802
The second is that; We should start implementing this. It doesn't address all

7
00:00:20,802 --> 00:00:23,861
cases, but this is a good start and we'll figure out the details as we go. The

8
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:27,566
third choice is no, that we should figure out how to address all the cases first

9
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:31,271
and make sure that we have correct pseudo code before we try writing any actual

10
00:00:31,271 --> 00:00:35,072
python code. And finally no, we should give up on this direction and try to find

11
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,873
a simpler way to solve this problem.
