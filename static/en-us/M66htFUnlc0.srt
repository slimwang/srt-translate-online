00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,494
So the essence of Chomsky's view on language, is that the human mind learns

2
00:00:04,494 --> 00:00:09,680
language naturally and easily. In fact, actually, learning is not even the best

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,936
word. We discover language, much the same way we discover walking. It just

4
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:18,206
happens to us. In fact, think about how easy it was for you learning your first

5
00:00:18,206 --> 00:00:23,282
native language. You didn't really learn it, it just happened. So, it's not at

6
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:28,841
all like math or reading or history, you just do it. This is Chomsky's view on

7
00:00:28,841 --> 00:00:30,455
language acquisition.
