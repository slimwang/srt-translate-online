Thanks Gregg. So finally your on two and a half to three years old children

2
00:00:03,832 --> 00:00:09,138
begin the third phase of language development which is the sentence phase. Here

3
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:12,927
they begin speaking in grammatical sentences. Now we know that children go

4
00:00:12,927 --> 00:00:17,110
through predictable stages of language acquisition. That's from cooing to

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:22,330
babbling then onto one word utterances. Then two-word utterances. And finally,

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,095
into the sentence phase. Now, all of this happens in approximately the first

7
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:30,860
three years of life. It's no coincidence that the brain of a three year-old

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,435
child is about 80% of an adult size brain. Again, this demonstrates the

9
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,571
importance of the size of our brain and our ability to develop and understand

10
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:39,939
language.
