1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
In this lesson, we will talk
about system virtualization.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,360
It's another important component of the
system software stack that's involved

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,000
in the management of
the physical resources.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,220
We will explain what is virtualization
and why it is important.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,270
And we will discuss what are some of the
key technical approaches that are part

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,880
of popular virtualization solutions,
such Xen and KVM and VMware CSX.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,530
In addition,

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,370
at the end of the lesson we will discuss
what are some of the hardware advances

9
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:33,020
that have occurred over the last decade
in response to virtualization trends.

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,702
Specifically in the context
of the x86 architecture.

11
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:41,310
A lot of the content in this lecture is
also summarized in a paper by Rosenblum

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,610
and Garfunkel.

13
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,240
Virtual Machine Monitors,
Current Technologies and Future Trends.

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,550
Note that this is a paper from 2005,
so much more has happened in

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,020
the virtualization space than what
this paper what this paper describes.

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,780
But it gives,
does serve as a useful reference.
