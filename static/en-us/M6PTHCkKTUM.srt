Because of the severity of the symptoms associated with schizophrenia, there's

2
00:00:03,357 --> 00:00:08,430
been a great deal of research to look at the causes for this disorder. And we

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,994
can see clearly from the research that schizophrenia is both a fascinating yet

4
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:15,504
tragic disorder that is a result of the dynamic interplay between both nature

5
00:00:15,504 --> 00:00:20,854
and nurture. Let's take a look at how these two forces work together to produce

00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:26,168
schizophrenia. The major model looking at the interplay of nature and nurture

7
00:00:26,168 --> 00:00:30,980
in the development of schizophrenia is called the diathesis-stress model. Let's
