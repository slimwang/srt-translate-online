We've recently seen an explosion
of new VR hardware companies and

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,460
there are many more coming soon.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,138
This lesson is going to cover
the major categories of VR devices and

4
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:13,386
their features.

5
00:00:13,386 --> 00:00:17,756
Please note that we are not going
to cover any one device in detail.

6
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:20,778
But rather look at the characteristics
that define all of the various

7
00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:21,359
platforms.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,390
So, without further ado, let's check out
the major VR platforms and paradigms.
