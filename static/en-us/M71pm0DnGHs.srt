1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,380
So in fact, let's, let's go there, let's, let's go to use case number two,

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,400
which was the having to do with the containment vessel was not ready.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,510
So our first use case asks the question, but

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,150
the question might come out negative and

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,830
in that case we have like a contingency we have to, have to deal with.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,310
So this is a variant on the, on the first use case.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,020
So, in order to get there,

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,100
the, the steps are that the query is sent to the containment vessel.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,420
If it is not ready then a message must be sent to the hot water source,

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,940
telling it to stop or prevent the flow of water.

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,490
Now what's, what's going on here is, really a couple things.

12
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:42,600
One is, the startup situation where, before we even start.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,777
The, we check whether the, the pot is there, but

14
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:50,540
it could also be the case that somebody pulls that pot out too quickly, okay?

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,960
And so in that case it's not going to be ready either.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,740
In both of those situations we want to make sure that

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,820
water doesn't start pouring through.

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,272
We can extrapolate it and

19
00:01:00,272 --> 00:01:06,460
indicate that when the containment vessel is returned to the, the heating plate.

20
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,360
Another message is sent to the hot water source, enabling it to resume.

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,470
So we're talking about one to turn, turn off the hot water source and

22
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,540
the other one to turn it back on.
