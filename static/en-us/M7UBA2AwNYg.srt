1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,700
Both of these commands do the same
thing, so this one is true.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,360
The new command does not have an alias,
so running this command will not work.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,880
These two also do the same thing,
so this is true.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,960
The generate command does have an alias,
but it's not gen, so this is also wrong.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,460
Generates alias is just the letter G.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,460
We'll be using it often
to build our app.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,510
Professionals try to do as little
work as possible while achieving

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,950
the same outcome.

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,130
Why work hard when you don't have to?

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,840
We'll be generating a lot of files and

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,820
typing out the letter G is a lot faster
than typing out the word generate.

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,350
Ember gives you these shortcuts for
free, so use them.
