1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,350
>> All right. So, I'm going to highlight this

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,970
logical test. And delete it. Is that okay?

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,670
>> Yup. And, insert the field.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:11,500
>> Okay. So in this case, I'm checking if ticket type, which is way down

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:18,228
here, is equal to VIP.

6
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:18,740
>> In quotes.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,240
>> In quotes. And the quotes are for?

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,580
>> because it's a string.

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,280
>> String. So just some text.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,080
So if the ticket type is VIP, and the total spent

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,974
is 100 times the number of tickets sold, which is a field.

12
00:00:34,974 --> 00:00:40,320
>> Exactly. And then the value, false, let's say, you know, is $50 for, so

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,380
it'd be the exact same thing, but it would be 50 times the tickets purchased.

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,160
>> Okay.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,100
>> And you don't have to go through inserting the field that

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,730
way, you can just type it out, or copy and paste it.

17
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,390
>> Can I like, hit enter

18
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,510
here, and make it a little neater? I don't know,

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,970
it's hard for me to keep this all in line.

20
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:55,330
>> Sure.

21
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,850
>> Okay, so this should work, let's

22
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,620
check syntax. Uh-oh. Field type, field ticket

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,524
type C is a picklist field. Picklist

24
00:01:04,524 --> 00:01:06,540
fields are only supported in certain functions.
