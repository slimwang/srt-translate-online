1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,480
Congratulations.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,560
You've finished the final project,
and reached the end of this course.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,620
You've created a data-driven
web application, and

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,300
have a beautiful restaurant
menu app to show for it.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,870
However, we've only scratched
the surface of web development, so

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,300
keep going from here.

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,780
If you're interested in learning
more about the Flask framework,

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,400
the Flask documentation is
a great place to start.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,260
Add more features to the restaurant
menu application, or create a new

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,060
application of your own, using some of
the more advanced features of Flask.

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,410
I will also provide some links
in the instruction notes,

12
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,760
on deploying a Flask application,
to be shared with the outside world.

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,720
If you're interested in
adding more HTML, CSS, and

14
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,670
JavaScript features to your website,

15
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,050
take some time to check out some of
Udacity's awesome frontend classes.

16
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,663
Wherever you decide to go next from
here, I strongly encourage you to

17
00:00:40,663 --> 00:00:43,358
immerse yourself in the web
development community.

18
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:46,920
Read blogs, experiment, and share your
work with other web developers and

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,985
enthusiasts like yourself.

20
00:00:47,985 --> 00:00:50,489
[SOUND].

21
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,120
Well, sounds like it's dinner time for
me over here.

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,430
Thanks for
helping me show what's on the menu.
