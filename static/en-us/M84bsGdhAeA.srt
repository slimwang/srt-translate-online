00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,740
The main advantage of the AsyncTask is that you get

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,630
to focus on your app logic, what you need to do

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,100
on the background thread, and what you need to do when

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,490
it comes back to the main thread. You don't have to

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,026
worry about the details of threads and handlers. Of the methods

6
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:18,050
that I showed you, only doInBackground is required to be implemented.

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,670
onPostExecute is optional as well as some other methods. For each

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,150
method, tell us whether it's on the main or background thread.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,260
You have a 50% chance of getting each one correct or a 100%

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,930
if you actually go check the java doc, so go do that now.
