00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,005
Here, again,
there's more than one answer.

2
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:08,131
Chronic diseases don't recur after
going away for long periods of time.

3
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:09,278
They're chronic.

4
00:00:09,278 --> 00:00:11,865
Once you have them, you have them.

5
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:15,775
And, children are getting
chronic diseases.

6
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:20,309
In fact, because more and more children
are of these in the United States, more

7
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:24,990
and more children are developing chronic
diseases at an earlier and earlier age.
