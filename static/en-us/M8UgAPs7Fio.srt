1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,300
We know that this other city is directly east of Grant's hometown. So, we're not

2
00:00:04,312 --> 00:00:08,385
moving in the up and down or north and south direction at all when we go from

3
00:00:08,397 --> 00:00:12,190
here to here. We're only moving horizontally, which only changes the

4
00:00:12,287 --> 00:00:16,695
x-coordinate. We're moving over 200 miles so the x-coordinate becomes 200. Since

5
00:00:16,707 --> 00:00:20,730
you've moved 200 miles over from zero in the positive direction, and the y

6
00:00:20,742 --> 00:00:24,720
coordinate doesn't change at all. It stays as zero. We know that Udacity is

7
00:00:24,732 --> 00:00:28,626
directly north of this other city. So, if we move from the other city up to

8
00:00:28,638 --> 00:00:32,836
Udacity, all that we're changing is the y-coordinate, since we're only moving

9
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:37,021
vertically. That means that the horizontal coordinate stays the same, but it

10
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:42,749
needs to be the coordinate of this other city. So, Udacity is located at 200,

11
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:47,945
and it's y-coordinate will be 0 plus 700, or 700.
