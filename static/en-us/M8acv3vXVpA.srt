00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,512
Speaking of automation, it's worth
mentioning the autofocus attribute.

2
00:00:05,512 --> 00:00:11,290
Autofocus automatically puts the cursor
on an input when the input is rendered,

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,450
making it easy for
users to quickly begin using the form.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,940
Thus, the browsers immediately
move the focus to the input field.

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,480
However, mobile browsers ignore
the autofocus attribute, so

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,720
that the keyboard
doesn't randomly appear.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,089
The Google home page, for
example, as you could see here,

8
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:36,060
uses the autofocus attribute on the
search bar, because the vast majority of

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,540
users just want to start typing
the queries as soon as the page loads.

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,910
See, use autofocus when you
want to save your user's time.

11
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:52,270
But be careful because it will still
keyboard focus and potentially

12
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,570
prevent the backspace character
from being used for navigation.

13
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,120
Also, it's recommended that
you only autofocus inputs

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,130
that are above the fold.

15
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,270
Otherwise, the page will scroll
down immediately upon rendering,

16
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,350
which can be jarring.
