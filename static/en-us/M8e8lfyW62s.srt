00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's look at the solution
to our memory refresh quiz.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,420
We have a memory with 4096 rows and
this many columns.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,780
It needs to be refreshed
every 500 microseconds.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:17,810
And this is our read timing, where
these two steps and this one overlap.

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:22,706
So basically,
it takes us 4 plus 10 plus either 11 or

6
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:27,296
2 plus 4 nanoseconds before
we complete one read and

7
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:29,950
can proceed with the next one.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,390
Because 2 plus 4 is 6.

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,430
And 11 nanoseconds is longer.

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,880
That means that, really, the timing for
our read will be to select a row.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,960
So we need to select a row,
get the values from the row, and

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,430
then write the data back.

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,400
During this time,
the row needs to remain selected.

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,090
So the new read really cannot
begin until 4 plus 10 plus

15
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,437
11 nanoseconds into it.

16
00:00:54,437 --> 00:00:59,820
So the read takes 25 nanoseconds.

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,562
And that means we could be doing 40
million reads per second if all we had

18
00:01:04,562 --> 00:01:06,410
to do is do reads.

19
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,975
And this is where it becomes tricky,

20
00:01:08,975 --> 00:01:13,840
because during a second we need
to do a number of refreshes.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,640
The refresh period is 500 microseconds.

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,720
So the number of refreshes we have
to do it 2,000 times per second.

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,320
We need to do a refresh
of each of the rows.

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,970
To do that,
the row needs to be selected.

25
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,820
We need to get the bit value and
write it back, so

26
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,060
it takes the same time to do a refresh
of the row as it takes to do a read.

27
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,930
Meanwhile, our memory
cannot be doing the read.

28
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,842
So, really, we're expanding 2,000 x

29
00:01:44,842 --> 00:01:49,890
4,096 x 25 nanoseconds on refreshes.

30
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,508
But because they have
the same timing as reads,

31
00:01:52,508 --> 00:01:56,250
we can just compute how many
refreshes we have per second.

32
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,240
And we end up with 8.192
million refreshes per second.

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,690
And that means that we cannot
do all 40 million reads.

34
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:09,229
Pretty much out of these really, this
was assuming that we don't do refreshes.

35
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,729
So because we have to do eight and

36
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,800
change million refreshes, we have
that many less reads that we can do.

37
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,410
So the overall result here is
the difference between the two.

38
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:26,027
That's how many reads do we have left
after we have spent time on eight and

39
00:02:26,027 --> 00:02:28,250
change million refreshes?

40
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,574
So the final answer here is
the difference between this

41
00:02:32,574 --> 00:02:37,090
which is 31,808,000 reads per second.

42
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,910
So again, without refreshes we
would be able to do 40 million.

43
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,140
But because refreshes need to happen.

44
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,030
We only have this many
reads left in a second.
