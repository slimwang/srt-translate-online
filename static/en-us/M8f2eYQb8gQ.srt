1
00:00:00,035 --> 00:00:02,025
>> So now, let's analyze this algorithm.

2
00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:06,094
We know the complexity of the first phase, this reduced phase, already.

3
00:00:06,094 --> 00:00:14,619
We know that it has log n steps, as a function of the input count n, and order of n operations.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,106
So actually, if we have n elements, we're going to have n minus 1 additions.

5
00:00:20,106 --> 00:00:25,974
And the analysis for the downsweep phase is exactly the same as the analysis for the reduce phase

6
00:00:25,974 --> 00:00:29,268
because the communication pattern here is exactly the same,

7
00:00:29,268 --> 00:00:32,212
except mirror imaged as the communication pattern here.

8
00:00:32,212 --> 00:00:36,976
So we know the downsweep also has log n steps and a linear amount of work.

9
00:00:36,976 --> 00:00:41,989
This is great. We've now reached the same work efficiency as the serial implementation.

10
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:46,192
Note, however, that it has more steps than the Hillis and Steele formulation.

11
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:52,619
Recall that the Hillis and Steele formulation had log n steps and the Blelloch formulation,

12
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,865
this reduced downsweep method, has two log n steps.

13
00:00:56,865 --> 00:01:01,162
But the advantage of this Blelloch implementation is less work over all.

14
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:05,672
Recall again that the Hillis and Steele scan had o of n log n work,

15
00:01:05,672 --> 00:01:10,243
whereas the Blelloch scan has linear amount of work with respect to the input.

16
00:01:10,243 --> 00:01:13,346
Now which is faster? That's a good question.

17
00:01:13,346 --> 00:01:16,657
To some extent, it's dependent on the particular GPU, the problem size,

18
00:01:16,657 --> 00:01:19,703
the particular optimizations that you chose during the implementation.

19
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:22,391
But to give you a little bit of intuition as to how you might

20
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:26,405
think about the problem of choosing between two different formulations of the same algorithm,

21
00:01:26,405 --> 00:01:29,326
one of which has superior work efficiency

22
00:01:29,326 --> 00:01:35,074
like Blelloch scan, one of which has superior step efficiency like Hillis and Steele scan.
