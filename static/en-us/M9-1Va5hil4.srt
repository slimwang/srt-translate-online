1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,855
Now that you've seen the computation with specific values, let's do it in

2
00:00:02,855 --> 00:00:07,718
general. So what did we do? We started with the width of the floor, subtracted

3
00:00:07,718 --> 00:00:13,528
the size of the first white tile. Divide it by the sizes of the pairs, took the

4
00:00:13,528 --> 00:00:18,260
integer part. And that gave us the number of pairs. Now that's of course the

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,813
same as the number of red tiles, because every pair has one red tile. And, the

6
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:27,076
white tile says one more. All right, now, we're ready to program, and what I'd

7
00:00:27,076 --> 00:00:32,439
like you to do is to complete the program that we started for you. The program

8
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:37,300
will read as inputs, the width of the floor and the tile sizes. And your job

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,500
will be to run the computation that I've just developed, and to print the

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,773
answer. Here's the program for you to fill in. You already give the commands

11
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:50,891
for the input and for the output and your job was to put in the part of the

12
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:56,384
program that asked computation. Now we did this by hand, and let me show you

13
00:00:56,384 --> 00:01:00,876
again the formula that we obtain. That's the formula here. So we take the width

14
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:05,759
minus the tile size divided by twice the tile size, take the integer part.
