Lewis Terman a psychologist from Stanford University created an American

2
00:00:04,236 --> 00:00:09,549
version of an IQ Test called the Stanford-Binet test. The Stanford-Binet test

3
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:13,517
was the first to have national norms not just local ones, like the last ones we

4
00:00:13,517 --> 00:00:19,836
saw that was localized for Paris. The Stanford-Binet tests use the same IQ

5
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:25,026
ratio as we talked about before. Mental age over chronological age times the

6
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:30,280
average, which is 100. The test focused on three main domains, Verbal,

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,740
language, Quantitative, math, and Spatial. One problem with the test, however,

8
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,651
was that the questions they used were only for children and teenagers. So adult

9
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:44,668
intelligence couldn't be measured. David Weschler solved this problem by

10
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:48,149
creating a test of intelligence for adults, called the Weschler Adult

11
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:54,480
Intelligence Scale. This looked at the same domains as the Stanford-Binet test.

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,638
This test asked questions that were more adult appropriate. For example, why

13
00:00:58,638 --> 00:01:02,730
the individuals buy automobile insurance, or in what ways are boats and trains

14
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:09,175
the same. Modern versions also test working memory, with problems such as the

15
00:01:09,175 --> 00:01:22,400
examiner saying three numbers for example three, nine and seven. And then the

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,291
person is asked to repeat them back, or eight numbers, eight, five, nine,

17
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:27,870
seven, four, three, seven, two. And again, the person has to repeat these. The

18
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,420
more numbers a person can recall the greater their working memory is.
