1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,950
The answer here is false.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,939
You cannot do the sharing by sharing the
file descriptor numbers because those

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:12,850
descriptors point into a per
process table we're talking about.

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,190
Descriptor five value FD
being five means the fifth

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,340
entry in process one's open
file table points to something.

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,930
Okay, but process P2s open file
tables is entirely separate.

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,210
So fifth entry in there may
be pointing to nothing or

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,280
may be pointing to
altogether different file.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,760
So if you try to use the descriptor,
it won't take you to the right place,

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,420
in particular the file that process
P one is trying to share it.

11
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,750
Well it has the operating system data
structure set up to get to it, and

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,900
these are per process, so the same thing
as done for P2, it's not meaningful

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,250
to share file descriptors in Unix based
systems, so the answer here is false.
