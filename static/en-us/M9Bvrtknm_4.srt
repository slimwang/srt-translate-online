1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,075
The learning goals, outcomes, and
assessments of this course all mention

2
00:00:03,075 --> 00:00:06,020
the idea of contributing to
the field of educational technology.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,110
So it's really important that we ask,
what is educational technology?

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,260
Is educational technology
only the use of technology

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,940
in the context of learning?

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,750
As far as we're concerned, no.

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,570
For us, educational technologie
is any place for education and

8
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,490
technology intersect.

9
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,690
Even if it occurs far away from
the actual learning process.

10
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,610
So, for example, we could use technology
to help the admissions process,

11
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,980
to identify what students
are more likely to succeed.

12
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,250
We can use technology to
facilitate registration.

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,500
In fact, we already do, but
we can use it to make it better.

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,763
We could use technology
to help load balance or

15
00:00:33,763 --> 00:00:36,606
anticipate what classes are going
to draw more students so

16
00:00:36,606 --> 00:00:39,170
we can allocate our resources
more intelligently.

17
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,683
We could use technology to facilitate
collaboration at a distance,

18
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:44,585
to help students work on group projects
together even when they're not located

19
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:45,440
in the same place.

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,880
And there's also a big field that's not
the education using technology, but

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,920
it's the education of technology.

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,530
Teaching students to use technology or
to program or things like that.

23
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,120
So there are a lot of
places where education and

24
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,640
technology intersect that aren't right
there in the context of learning.

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,230
And as far as we're concerned,

26
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,660
they all fall under the umbrella
of educational technology.
