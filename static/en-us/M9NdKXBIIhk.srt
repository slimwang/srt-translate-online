1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:01,988
The top function takes 50% of the runtime,

2
00:00:01,988 --> 00:00:05,087
and that means that even if you made it go to 0 time,

3
00:00:05,087 --> 00:00:07,175
the program would only go twice as fast.

4
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:09,528
So you'd get a 2x speedup.

5
00:00:09,528 --> 00:00:12,696
The top 3 functions between them take 50%, 20%, and 10%,

6
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:14,563
or 80% of the total time.

7
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:16,332
So if you were to make those all drop to 0,

8
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:19,169
the program would be taking 20% of the time that it used to take

9
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:21,566
and you'd have gotten a 5x speed up.
