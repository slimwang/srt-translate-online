1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,390
As you've seen in this lesson,
there are a lot of interesting facets

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,600
to accessibility worth considering
when you're building your app.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,160
We saw in the second lesson that a well
laid out focus strategy is extremely

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,875
important, but without focus styling,
that effort goes completely to waste.

5
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:18,075
We also learned previously that semantic
markup is critical to assistive

6
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:19,605
technology users.

7
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:22,115
And with styling keyed off
of semantic properties,

8
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:25,675
we can ensure a consistent
experience for all of our users.

9
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:29,595
Ensuring all text meets a minimum color
contrast ratio is an easy way to improve

10
00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:30,815
readability for everyone,

11
00:00:30,815 --> 00:00:34,400
particularly those users with
any kind of vision impairment.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,330
And responsive design benefits
all mobile device users

13
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,580
as well as users who
employ browsers' zoom.

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,100
So keeping all of that in mind means our
final product is going to reach more

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,260
users, and those users are just going to
have a better time using our app.
