00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,019
I'll sign off by showing
you some pair of pandas.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,730
We are about to plot two columns
simultaneously on one graph.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,510
That is close and
adjusted close for the Apple stock.

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,196
Don't worry about how to extract
multiple columns from the data frame.

5
00:00:16,196 --> 00:00:19,995
But intuitively you use
a double square brackets and

6
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:24,740
pass the two column names,
that is Close and Adj Close.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,040
We go ahead and plot this.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,750
Here's the graph.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,600
You can observe two lines.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,160
One is blue, which corresponds
to Close; and one is green,

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,420
which corresponds to Adj Close.

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,871
Observe that we did not write
code to print the legend, or

13
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:42,760
give color to each of the graph lines.

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,410
This is the pair of the Python pandas.

15
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,710
The blue line corresponds
to the close value, and

16
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,310
the green line corresponds to
the adjusted close values.

17
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,710
You will learn in the further
lesson why there is a difference.

18
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,560
That's all for now,
I'll see you in the next lesson.

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,210
Happy coding.
