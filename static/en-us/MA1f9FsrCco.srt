1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,800
So I'm going to take you through sort of how this works, and

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,939
the key to the Hough Transform is Hough space.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,689
Here we have a line in image space.

4
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:11,125
And you all remember the first equation, you solve a line somewhere in Mrs.

5
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,480
Thompson's or Mrs. McGilacutti's or whoever your missus.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,480
Mine was Mr. Zebrow actually.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,000
He was also the football coach.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,210
I learned algebra from the football coach in junior high school,

9
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,330
which is a very strange thing.

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:28,650
Anyway so you remember that the equation line is y equals m 0 x plus b 0.

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,170
So what we're going to construct is what's called Hough space.

12
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,850
And it's really the Hough parameter space.

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,330
And in lines in this representation we have two parameters m and b.

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,720
So for this line y equals m0 x plus 0.

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,170
That's represented at a location in the Hough space at m0 b0.

16
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:48,920
So there it is.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,910
There's the point in Hough's space.

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,580
Now the key idea here is that the line in

19
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,250
the image corresponds to a point in Hough space.

20
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,300
Okay, you got that?

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,670
A line in the image corresponds to a point in Hough space.

22
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,040
Now we're going to do something a little different.

23
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,420
Suppose we only have one point in the image space.

24
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,380
And we'll put that point here at x0, y0.

25
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,110
Well, what are the equations of the lines that might go through that point?

26
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,510
Well, in image space we know that the line that goes through that

27
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,270
point is going to satisfy for whatever the m and the b are.

28
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,610
It's going to satisfy the equation y0 has to equal m x0 plus b, right?

29
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,550
That, in order for it to go through the point x0, y0 it has to have a m and

30
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,470
b such that this equation holds.

31
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,580
Well, with some very simple algebraic rearrangement,

32
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:42,192
that becomes b is equal to minus x0 m plus y0.

33
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,360
That's the equation of a line in m b space.

34
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,660
In fact, it's a line with slope negative x0 and intercept y0.

35
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,770
Okay, so the idea here is that a point in image space is a line in Hough space.

36
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,740
This is the duality.

37
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,790
Well, if we have one point, what happens if we have a second point?

38
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,160
X1, y1.

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,490
Well, that's going to be another line.

40
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,190
Right? That's going to be a line with b equals minus x1 m plus y1.

41
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,690
And so now here's the really cool question.

42
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,020
What line would be consistent with both points?

43
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,740
Well it has to be the point where these two lines in Hough's space intersect.

44
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,436
because that's the m and b that's consistent with being on

45
00:02:31,436 --> 00:02:36,190
a line that goes through x0 y0 and on a line that goes through m1 b1.

46
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,920
And this ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls and

47
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,660
all you interested parties, this is how we're going to find lines from points.

48
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,840
So, now we have to reduce this to an algorithm.

49
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,850
We'll first do it graphically and then actually show the algorithm.

50
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,170
So basically, every point gives me a line in Hough space.

51
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,850
So what I do is, I create a grid, here it's of m and b, we're going to

52
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,760
change that in a minute, which, which are made up of a set of bins.

53
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,850
And every point votes for

54
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,990
a line's worth of bins, so it casts a vote in every bin that it goes through.

55
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,720
You collect up all the votes.

56
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,620
And after every point has voted, and

57
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,220
whichever bin has the most votes, that's your line.

58
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,330
So this, basically, we're going to be casting votes into bins and

59
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,320
then finding the bins that have, sort of a large number of votes.

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,880
Larger than, sort of the average noisy area.

61
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,960
Before we implement this in real code and real math,

62
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,500
we're going to have to rethink our representation of lines just a little bit.

63
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,330
You might remember,

64
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,510
that there were some issues with the m b representation of ver, or lines.

65
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,305
In particular for example a vertical line is really painful, right?

66
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:48,156
Because m is equal to infinity and in 7th or 8th grade or 9th grade or

67
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:50,522
12th grade algebra.

68
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:54,150
The notion of having an infinite slope is kind of very painful.

69
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,885
All right, so

70
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:58,639
what we want to do is we want to use a more robust representation of lines.

71
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,140
So that we don't have any sort of bad numerical problems.

72
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,910
So what we're going to use is a polar representation for lines.
