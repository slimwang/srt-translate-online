00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,650
We'll be teaching you how to
use Google's platforms and

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,830
tools to build these
kinds of experiences for

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,220
your users, while staying relevant and
unobtrusive.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,620
>> Now keep in mind this is
not an introductory course.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,690
We're going to assume that you're
already familiar with the Java

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,410
programming language, and that you
already know the Android platform.

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,390
>> If you're unsure if you're ready for

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,920
this course, we recommend you start
with Developing Android Apps.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,200
>> Also make sure to check
out the instructor notes for

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,720
other resources that will
introduce you to Android and Java.

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,480
>> Let's get started!
