1
00:00:00,255 --> 00:00:02,000
When we put it all together,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,802
non-seasonal ARIMA models
are displayed as ARIMA p, d, q.

3
00:00:05,802 --> 00:00:09,237
The p, d, and q values represent
the amount of periods to lag for

4
00:00:09,237 --> 00:00:10,715
in our ARIMA calculation.

5
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:14,505
Basically, that means
that we said p = 2.

6
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:18,275
We'll be using the two previous periods
of our time series in the autoregressive

7
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:20,095
portion of the calculation.

8
00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:23,385
This helps adjust the line
fitted to forecast the series.

9
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:26,195
Purely AR models will look
like a linear regression where

10
00:00:26,195 --> 00:00:29,215
the predictive variables are a certain
number of previous periods

11
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:31,015
which is represented by p.

12
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:34,115
The differencing term refers to
the process we use to transform a time

13
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:36,210
series into a stationary one.

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,080
That is a series without trend or
seasonality.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,090
This process is called differencing and

16
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,590
the d refers to the number of
transformations used in the process.

17
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,502
And, the moving average term refers
to the lag of the error component.

18
00:00:48,502 --> 00:00:52,766
As a quick reminder, the error component
refers to the part of the time series

19
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:55,008
not explained by trend or seasonality.

20
00:00:55,008 --> 00:00:58,467
MA models look like linear regression
models where the predictive variables

21
00:00:58,467 --> 00:01:00,180
are the previous q periods of errors.
