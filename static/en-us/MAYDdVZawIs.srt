1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,596
So, what is computer architecture. Architecture, in the sense that

2
00:00:05,596 --> 00:00:09,250
we all know it, is about designing a building that

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,652
is well suited for its purpose. So, it could be

4
00:00:12,652 --> 00:00:16,044
designing, for example, an apartment building or a house and

5
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:18,540
what we want is for this building to be designed

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,908
so that it work wells for whatever you want to

7
00:00:20,908 --> 00:00:23,304
use it. Like, for a family to live in or

8
00:00:23,304 --> 00:00:25,510
for a lot of people to live in. Or if it's

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,670
an office building, for a lot of offices to

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,710
be there and the employees to be happy and

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,944
so on. So, computer architecture is similar in that

12
00:00:33,944 --> 00:00:37,298
it is about designing a computer this time that

13
00:00:37,298 --> 00:00:40,824
is well suited for its purpose. So, we can

14
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:43,530
have a large desktop computer, or a much smaller

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,910
laptop computer. Or even a smartphone. And we want

16
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,830
to design each of these so that they work well.

17
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,110
Maybe the desktop, because it's larger, can

18
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,310
be much more powerful. The laptop provides

19
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,900
some computational power in a much more

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,065
constrained space. And the phone provides us with

21
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:05,298
a good battery life and it's very light weight and still provides us with

22
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,312
some computational power that is enough to,

23
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:09,260
for example, do web browsing and so on.
