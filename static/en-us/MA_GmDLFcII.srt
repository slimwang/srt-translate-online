1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,680
First off notation wise, they correspond to the concrete operations.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,260
We're going to have variables Q sub 1,

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,160
Q sub 2, so on, to correspond to the abstract ones which were the Ps.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,900
And similarly to correspond to the abstract state which was indicated by s.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,610
We're going to have the concrete state indicated by t as

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,810
a typical concrete state element. And capital T as the set of concrete states.

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,650
And then, the interesting one is that we're going to introduce a function,

8
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:34,920
a retrieve function. Here, I'm using retr as an abbreviation for it. And it's

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,185
going to map from concrete states to abstract ones. That is, retrieve on some t,

10
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:46,800
concrete state t, is going to be corresponding to some abstract state s.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,350
And it's always going to be the case that, t goes to a single s.

12
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,202
However, it might be the case that different ts go to the same s.

13
00:00:55,202 --> 00:00:59,540
You kind of expect that because at the lower level we have more details. And so,

14
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,150
we can get into more states. But

15
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,790
those states are going to map into a fewer number of abstract states.
