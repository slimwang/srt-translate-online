00:00:06,118 --> 00:00:08,025
another course developer
here at Udacity.

00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:09,560
>> Hi there.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,096
>> By now you've learned how to
develop your first website with HTML.

6
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,932
Now James is here to help you
take things a little further and

7
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,790
add some style to your sites.

00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,510
>> Right, in this lesson, you'll be
writing CSS to improve the look of your

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,880
sites, and along the way you'll
try out browser developer tools.

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,740
Dev tools are incredibly
useful amongst other things

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,020
you'll find that you can test styles
really, really quickly using them.

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,280
>> That's awesome, I love DEV tools.

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,090
All right, that's it for me now i'm
going to leave you to it james.

00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,350
>> All right, let's get started.
