1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,840
So the structured knowledge for a presentation called script has six parts to

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,800
it. The first part is called entry conditions. These are the conditions

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,460
necessary to execute the script. So, for a restaurant script, as an example,

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,190
the entry condition might be that there is a customer who is hungry and

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,143
the customer has some money. The result refers to the conditions that will

6
00:00:20,143 --> 00:00:24,180
become true, after the script has occurred, after it has taken place. So, for

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,510
restaurant script, the result might be that the owner of some restaurant has

8
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,729
more money, the customer has less money, and the customer is now pleased and

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,240
is no longer hungry. So the third part of a script is our props. So

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,320
the third part of script are called props. Props are the kind of

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,150
objects that are involved in the execution of this script so

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,030
in case of the restaurant script the props might include tables and

13
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:52,290
menus and food items and so on. So the fourth part of a script is roles.

14
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,890
These are the agents involved in the execution of the script. As an example in

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,390
the restaurant script it might be a customer who goes to a restaurant,

16
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,470
the owner of the restaurant, the waiter or the waitresses in the restaurant, and

17
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,560
so on. The fifth element of a script is a track. Track are variations or

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,850
subclasses of a particular script. So for example in case of

19
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,690
the restaurant script we may have tracks for going to a coffee house, or

20
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,440
going to a fast food restaurant, or to a fine dining house. And

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:22,400
finally the sixth element of a script refers to scenes. Scenes are specific

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,980
sequence of events that occur during the execution of the script. So in case of

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,430
the restaurant script there might be a scene for entering a restaurant. And

24
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,040
a scene for ordering food. And a third scene for accepting the food and so on.

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,710
When you put all of the six elements together then you get a complete script.

26
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,570
In the previous lesson we had taken the metaphor of a molecule as a knowledge

27
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,930
representation. That is, knowledge representations that are not small or short

28
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,080
or not atomic, but are molecule in nature, script is a big, large molecule.
