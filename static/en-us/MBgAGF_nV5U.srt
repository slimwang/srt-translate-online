00:00:00,165 --> 00:00:02,903
So today, you’re in for a treat. You’re going

2
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:04,851
to learn a theorem and I won't prove anything

3
00:00:04,852 --> 00:00:07,432
to you, you learn it by doing but this theorem

4
00:00:07,432 --> 00:00:10,882
is really important for all of statistics. So let’s dive in.

5
00:00:10,882 --> 00:00:14,130
And what this theorem really is about many coin

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,082
flips. Almost generally it’s about the

7
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:19,534
distribution of the sum of many things.

8
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:23,000
So let’s study many things.
