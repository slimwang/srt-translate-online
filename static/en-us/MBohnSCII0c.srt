00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,637
Let me show you just more example just to highly a particular little problem.

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:06,907
So here we have a nice man-made scene of a some beautiful bridge

3
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:08,042
somewhere in Europe.

4
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:14,170
And you'll notice that there is this strong vertical here.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,642
And a vertical if you think about coming down this way and

6
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:20,550
coming that, is a step edge horizontally.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay. You remember, dots like this are sinusoids that,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,700
that vary as you go up and down.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,270
And you remember that if you have a step edge,

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,520
remember we had a square wave, okay?

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,090
It had all the frequencies, just in decreasing power.

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,730
And what you're seeing is a whole bunch of frequencies in

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,800
decreasing power coming down.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,290
So the question is,

15
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:46,420
where is the strong horizontal edge that's suggested by that vertical line?

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,830
Remember a vertical line is all of these frequencies, which means that it's got

17
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,720
a horizontal sharp edge, and the answer is a little tricky.

18
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,750
Basically, if you think about how the sinusoid goes in the image,

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,340
it's essentially as if it assumes the image just kept wrapping around, okay?

20
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,290
Remember we talked about the Fourier series,

21
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,830
assuming that everything just kind of repeats?

22
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,210
So here what we're essentially doing when we do this sum from minus n over

23
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:21,590
2 to n over 2, is we're assuming that the thing continues, that it's periodic.

24
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,540
Which would mean that the thing over here should be the same as the thing

25
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,720
over there.

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,970
And if it's not, that would represent a significant change.

27
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:37,310
And, this edge down here, is really different than that edge down there.

28
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,690
So when you wrap it around, you get a big step.

29
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,870
And that's what cor, causing that sort of weirdness in the Fourier transform.

30
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,560
Do you remember when we talked about doing filtering in MATLAB?

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,180
There was, there was a wrap option.

32
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,030
To head out off the edges instead of replicate or reflect.

33
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,800
You could take the stuff from the top and put it back down on the bottom.

34
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,840
And I said that won't make any sense to you at all until we get to

35
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,100
Fourier analysis.

36
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,095
Well, that's as if you had a periodic signal.

37
00:02:05,095 --> 00:02:08,820
Because if you don't have that, you get this funny sort of sharp edge.

38
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,510
One way to eliminate that when you're doing Fourier analysis is you'll take

39
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,120
you're image, and you'll multiply the whole image by a Gaussian that tapers off

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,300
towards zero by the edges, and then everything becomes nice and smooth.

41
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,799
When in doubt, fix your life with a Gaussian.
