00:00:00,276 --> 00:00:02,288
For the homework, you were asked to calculate the

2
00:00:02,288 --> 00:00:05,611
signature of a message M3. The first thing to know is

3
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:11,457
that M3 equals M1 times M2. Substituting M from

4
00:00:11,457 --> 00:00:13,341
here, we can apply the exponent to each determine

5
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:15,724
the product and we can extend this out applying the

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,094
modulus to each product. And M1 to the D power

7
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:22,527
mod n is signature 1 and M2 to the power of D mod

8
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:26,060
n is signature 2 and since in our first line, the

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,259
signature was taken mod n, you take this mod n and

10
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:33,000
this is our answer.
