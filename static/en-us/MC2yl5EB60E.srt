1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,180
So, we have the same goal, which is to create an

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,935
awesome pizza application on Android. And now we've ended up with

3
00:00:04,935 --> 00:00:08,540
three feature lists, yours, mine, and yours. So what is the

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,900
best set of features to end up in this perfect app?

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,550
>> So this is a really common problem

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,030
that you as a developer have probably faced

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,520
over and over again. You have all these

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,650
really great ideas, so which ones are going to go

9
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,700
into your feature list? I can totally see

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,160
a lot of people wanting to order the same

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,710
thing every time. And I can also see

12
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,310
a lot people wanting to order fresh new things.

13
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,810
So what are our two main options here? What are our solutions?

14
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,890
>> Well, there's two things we could do. One is, we could

15
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,990
actually combine all the features. And end up with an application that

16
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,120
has nine features. So, maybe accommodating

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,310
everyone's perspectives into account and or,

18
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,230
or another thing we could do is we could just pick one.

19
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:46,350
>> Yeah.

20
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,410
>> So basically pick either your or mine or your feature list and

21
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:51,910
go with that.

22
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,530
>> So these are really both bad options because if you

23
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,080
were to combine one or more of these feature lists, you're

24
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,840
going to kind of have an application that doesn't really please anyone.

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,489
When you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing no one.

26
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,390
>> Yeah, exactly.

27
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,470
>> And if you were to just pick one application

28
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,890
that maybe would represent you or your how do you know

29
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,750
how many people out there actually have those same attributes?

30
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,880
You could be missing out on a lot of different things.

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,910
>> So how do we solve this if both of these are not that good of an option?

32
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,570
>> Well, this is where user-centric design comes in. We

33
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,050
design a product with a specific user in mind. So,

34
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,750
one of the keys to user-centric design is overcoming our

35
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,350
own biases. So what we've experienced here is preference bias,

36
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,470
that our own preferences are really being put directly into

37
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,630
a feature list, and we're not designing for user, we're

38
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,170
just designing for ourselves. So next we're going to learn about

39
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,090
another bias that we really need to be aware of.
