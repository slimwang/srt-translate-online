1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To find this out, we sort the list.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here are the ages of the kids,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and here are the ones of the parents.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now we see the median is 4.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Is this a useful statistic?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Not really.
