1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,767
It's important to note that although some people experience negative

2
00:00:03,767 --> 00:00:08,070
consequences for using LSD or similar drug. Some researchers have found that

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,420
these drugs actually are really beneficial medications for some conditions. In

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,420
fact, this has led some of the top researchers in the field to examine the

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,595
beneficial therapeutic effects of these drugs.

6
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:22,020
>> That's right. For example, LSD has been used in the treatment of cluster

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,210
headaches and there's new research looking at LSD for treating drug dependence.

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,549
However, it's important to note that LSD is a schedule one drug, which means

9
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:34,465
there are serious consequences for both use and possession.

10
00:00:34,465 --> 00:00:37,131
>> But who better to tell us about all this than two world-renowned experts in

11
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:40,800
their field. First, we're going to talk to Doctor Griffiths about his research

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,986
with psilocybin. Right, and then we'll come back and talk to Doctor Doblin, who

13
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:49,670
is the founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Science.

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,700
He's going to discuss MDMA or Ecstasy with us.
