1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,172
For this inequality, the interval would be negative infinity to negative 3,

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:09,480
union 2 to positive infinity. Great solving if you found those two regions.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,720
When we find the solution set for a quadratic inequality, we first want to

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,732
start by finding the zeros. These are the x values that make the equation equal

5
00:00:17,732 --> 00:00:22,865
to 0. We factor this quadratic using x plus 3 times x minus 2 as the factors,

6
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:26,765
then we set each factor to equal to 0 to get x equals negative 3 and x equals

7
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:32,956
positive 2. We use these x values to set up our three intervals, so we know the

8
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:36,924
values of x might be less than negative 3, between negative 3 and 2, or greater

9
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:43,330
than 2. These different regions are the possible solutions to our inequality.

10
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:47,870
We test the value in the first interval to see if it makes the inequality true.

11
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,714
I'm going to choose the value x equals negative 4. Plugging in negative 4 for

12
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:56,548
x, we'll get 6 is greater than 0, which we know is a true statement. This

13
00:00:56,548 --> 00:01:01,558
means, any value less than negative 3 will make this inequality true. And

14
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,256
notice, we've already got our first interval. Negative infinity to negative 3,

15
00:01:06,256 --> 00:01:10,785
here. We need to test the value now for interval II. I'll use x equals 0, since

16
00:01:10,785 --> 00:01:15,206
that's pretty easy to plug in and evaluate. If x is equal to 0, then these two

17
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:20,386
terms would drop out. They would just be 0. And we'd be left with negative 6 is

18
00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:25,654
greater than 0. We know this statement is not true. So this region is false. We

19
00:01:25,654 --> 00:01:29,490
exclude it from our solution set. And finally, we try a different value of x

20
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,960
for our third interval. I'll use x equals 3. When we plug in x equals 3, here

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,542
and here, we'll get the statement 6 is greater than 0. This is true. This means

22
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:46,057
any value greater than 2 will satisfy our original inequality. And notice we

23
00:01:46,057 --> 00:01:50,470
have our second region. From 2 all the way up to positive infinity.
