00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,195
When building a successful e-commerce
business, the first thing that you have

2
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:11,297
to realize is that the best customer
is a customer who keeps coming back.

3
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:13,380
And so as we look at Teespring,

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,066
the people who do really well
on our platform are people

5
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:21,410
who've been able to build a brand
with our buyers on Teespring.

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,810
And been able to bring them
back over and over and

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,130
over again to be able to
purchase more and more products.

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,740
And the best thing,
what you can do to actually ensure

9
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,170
that is really invest
in customer service.

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:43,380
And really invest in sort of answering
any questions that your customers have.

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,350
And kind of really making
your customers feel that

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,570
you as the kind of e-commerce platform,
or

13
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:57,640
as a product owner,
actually care about what they want.

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,930
And so it's really easy to kind
of think about, all right,

15
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,910
let's optimize the purchase flow,

16
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,730
let's kind of cut costs where we can,
let's offer the cheapest price.

17
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,090
But at the end of the day, what's
going to bring that buyer back again is

18
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,510
the customer service and the actual end
to end experience that you offer them.
