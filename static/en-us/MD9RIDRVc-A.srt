00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,446
Many argue that this campaign gave birth to

2
00:00:02,446 --> 00:00:06,130
modern demand advertising. The objective here was not demand

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,360
generation nor branch strengthening. But simply to impress the

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,360
glamor, the sentiment and the emotional charge contained in

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,950
the product, itself. The company gave diamonds to

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,790
movie stars. They sent out press packets emphasizing the

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,590
size of diamonds that celebrities gave each other. They

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,250
loaned diamonds to prominent socialites attending events like the

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,550
Kentucky Derby or the Academy Awards. And even persuaded the

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,780
British royal family to wear diamonds over other gems. Later,

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,340
De Beers sought to market diamond rings to couples as

12
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,029
a status symbol. To reflect quote, a man's success in life.

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,700
A 1980's add introduced the famous two month bench

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,690
mark. Isn't two months salary a small price to pay

15
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,570
for something that lasts forever? By any reasonable measure, Francis

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,110
Geary succeeded. Getting engaged in America means getting a diamond

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,480
ring. Can you think of a movie where two people

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,620
get engaged with out a diamond? When you get engaged

19
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,920
on Facebook, what icon does the site display? Still think

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,560
this might not be the most successful mass persuasion effort

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,420
in history? I present to you a James Bond film. Whose title bears

22
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,520
the diamond cartel's trademark. Awe-inspiring and a

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,500
little terrifying. Let's open the data set.
