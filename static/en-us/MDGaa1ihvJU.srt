00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,287
So, there are two main scientific theories of human intelligence, but before we

2
00:00:04,287 --> 00:00:09,490
get into those theories, let's remember what scientific theories are all about.

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,470
Scientific theories explain and organize the known evidence on a given topic.

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,155
It's important to remember, though, that good scientific theories, are always

5
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:23,335
open to change, based on that scientific evidence. So, scientific theories make

6
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:28,500
testable predictions, and we test those predictions, with empirical studies.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,820
The results of those studies, then, lead scientists to either confirm,

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,044
disconfirm, or modify, their theories. So now I'm going to send you over to

9
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:40,780
Lauren to talk about the two theories of human intelligence.
