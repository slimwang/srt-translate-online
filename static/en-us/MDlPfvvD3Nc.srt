1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's the second one--minus the partial derivative of pressure with respect to x.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If you look closely into what we've got here,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(p₁ - p₂) / Δx--

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
if this was (p₂ - p₁) / Δx, we would get the derivative,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but it's the negative of it.
