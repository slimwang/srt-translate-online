1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,920
Let's go download the code for
this course.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,140
It lives on github.com.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,802
So first we need to open up a browser.

4
00:00:06,802 --> 00:00:15,775
The address is github.com/udacity/ud405.

5
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:16,413
So here we are,

6
00:00:16,413 --> 00:00:19,520
code supporting the free Udacity class
2D Game Development with LibGDX.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,123
Looks like we're in the right spot.

8
00:00:21,123 --> 00:00:24,285
Looks like there's a bunch of
folders that are numbered and

9
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:26,823
labelled either Demo,
Exercise, Solution.

10
00:00:26,823 --> 00:00:27,542
Okay, cool.

11
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:31,186
If we scroll down here, we find a nice
little ReadMe that says you can download

12
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:33,946
this code using the grey
download zip button on the right.

13
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:36,268
If we actually scroll up a little
bit to find that, here we go.

14
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:37,905
Download zip.

15
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:40,303
All right, while that's downloading,
let's have a look around.

16
00:00:40,303 --> 00:00:43,427
Looks like the ReadMe also says
that instructions for importing and

17
00:00:43,427 --> 00:00:46,015
running these projects can
be found in this directory.

18
00:00:46,015 --> 00:00:47,653
All right, let's have a look.

19
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:51,274
If we check out the ReadMe down in
this directory by scrolling down.

20
00:00:51,274 --> 00:00:53,833
Let's see, we have instructions for
importing and

21
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,555
running your first LibGDX project,
description of the app architecture,

22
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:59,998
instructions on installing
Android Studio, and

23
00:00:59,998 --> 00:01:03,511
instructions on running the desktop and
Android versions of the game.

24
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:07,398
This seems suspiciously like what
the rest of this lesson is about.

25
00:01:07,398 --> 00:01:11,292
Well really, you can think of the course
code as being the textbook for

26
00:01:11,292 --> 00:01:12,089
this course.

27
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:15,672
People learn best in different sorts
of ways, so if you want to listen to me

28
00:01:15,672 --> 00:01:18,695
talk about LibGDX,
that's a great way to take this course.

29
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:21,905
But if you'd rather just read
instructions and play around with code,

30
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:24,956
well, you could actually get pretty
much everything I have to teach

31
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:27,494
out of this course,
just by looking at the course code.

32
00:01:27,494 --> 00:01:29,358
So that's an option for you.

33
00:01:29,358 --> 00:01:33,654
Looks like our download is finished, so
let's go extract that somewhere useful.

34
00:01:33,654 --> 00:01:35,442
So here we are in our downloads folder.

35
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:39,134
We have the UD405 master zip,
that's what we just downloaded.

36
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:41,560
Lets move that to the desktop.

37
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,778
And we'll go ahead and extract it.

38
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:47,623
And you should see that same directory
structure that you saw back on GitHub,

39
00:01:47,623 --> 00:01:49,942
just a bunch of numbered and
labeled folders.

40
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:52,542
All right that now that you've
seen me do it, it's time for

41
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:54,005
you to download the course code.

42
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:59,903
Navigate to github.com/audicity/ud405 or
follow the link in the instructors note.

43
00:01:59,903 --> 00:02:01,238
Download as a zip.

44
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:03,499
Or if you know what you're
doing with Git and GitHub,

45
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:04,813
you can just fork and clone it.

46
00:02:04,813 --> 00:02:07,355
Extract it somewhere useful,
I recommend on the desktop.

47
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:10,758
And when you finally see the contents,
check off this box here too.
