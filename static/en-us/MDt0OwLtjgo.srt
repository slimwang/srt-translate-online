00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And here's my answer. It's a one-liner.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
A bid in an array of 1000 things, and this is the beauty of Python.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There's ways to make it more complicated as it is before in the variance case.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now this is a little bit more compact. So I ran the test random.random larger than 0.5.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And this thing over here gives me the true or false and I want to do this 1000 times.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And doing this 1000 times invokes this command for x in range (N) where N is 1000

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and range N becomes a list of 0 to 999.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This will go 1000 times of different x's.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The x's that we've used here because the random coin flip

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
doesn't understand what the order of the coin flip is.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
They're the same every single time but this just means I ran this procedure over here 1000 times,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
collected the results in the bracketed list, and returned it.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Specifically, if we were to print out f and hit the run button then what I get is the stuff down here.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
A list of 1000 items of false, true, and false. It makes for a beautiful wallpaper, doesn't it.
