00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to my class on robotics.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In many ways this is applying AI technology to the problem of robotics.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You might remember that a robot agent takes in sensor data from its environment.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Here is the environment and here is the robot agent.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It processes it into controls and actions

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
that it uses to manipulate its actuators.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Robotics is the science of bridging the gap between sensor data and actions.
