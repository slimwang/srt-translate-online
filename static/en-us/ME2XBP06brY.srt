00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,488
And this one is the floor function. You can see that for a given x value, the y

2
00:00:04,488 --> 00:00:10,250
value will be equal to the next lowest integer. Unless x itself is an integer,

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,990
in which case y equals x. Please know that the only difference between this

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,190
graph and this one, is the placement of the empty circle and the closed circle

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,109
in each step.
