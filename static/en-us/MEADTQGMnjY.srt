1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,250
After copying over the assets, updating
the launcher icon in the Android

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,890
manifest, and adding the helper
methods to the utility class,

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,410
we need to modify to detail fragment and
forecast it after classes.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,050
In the detail fragment
onload finished method,

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,350
we read the weather condition
code from the cursor.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,670
Then we pass this into the utility
helper method to get the resource ID for

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,610
the colored icon in order to
set it on the image view.

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,730
The ForecasterAdapter change is a little
trickier because we want to use

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,610
a colored icon for the today layout and
we want to use a gray icon for

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,590
the other days.

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,660
In order to distinguish between the two,

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,880
we call getItemViewType given
the current cursor position.

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,410
If the view type is today.

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,970
Then we get the weather
condition code from the cursor.

15
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:47,010
Then we get the resource ID for the
colored image from the helper method.

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,820
And then we set that
on to the image view.

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,800
If the view type is for

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,740
a future day, then we read the weather
condition code from the cursor.

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,900
Then we pass it into the helper
method to get the resource ID for

20
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,270
the gray icon and
then we set that on to the image view.

21
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,290
If you previously hard coded
an image into the layout,

22
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,160
then you should remove that value now.

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,590
Otherwise on app launch, it will
load up the placeholder image and

24
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,280
then flash to the actual icon.

25
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,950
Now that the wire frame
implementation for

26
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,350
the phone UI is pretty much complete,
let's look at the tablet UI.
