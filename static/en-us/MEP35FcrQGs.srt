1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,630
Let's look at the histograms of f0 and f1, and f0 and f2 again.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,260
Let's switch to the iPython notebook quickly.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,312
Here we are looking at two histograms of f0 and f2.

4
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:20,545
The f0 is the average submitted charge amount shown in green,

5
00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:26,510
and f2 is the average Medicare allowed amount shown in blue.

6
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,740
Notice the shape of the two histograms are quite different.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:39,000
Moreover, the value ranges for f0 and f2 are also quite different.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,740
Similarly, you can look at the histogram of f0 which is, again, in green.

9
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:49,520
And f1, which is the Medicare payment amounts, given in red.

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,950
Here also you see a difference in shape, and range of the histograms.

11
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,430
To compare two histograms in the same range, we can scale the variables.

12
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,890
To scale variables, we can subtract the minimum value of

13
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,260
the variable from each of those valleys of the variables.

14
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,880
And divide by the range of the variable which is

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,640
the maximum value minus the minimum value.

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,328
Let's now use this formula to scale each of our variables, and

17
00:01:22,328 --> 00:01:25,190
re-plot our histograms.

18
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,480
Upon running, you will get something like this.

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,850
It is very hard to see here.

20
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,560
So in the next histogram we will make this into a logarithmic scale.

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:42,540
To change the y scale to logarithmic, we have changed log equals 1 in the code.

22
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,760
Let's run this part of the code.

23
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,010
You should now have a histogram that looks like this.

24
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:54,200
This is the histogram of f0 and f2 plotted in a logarithmic scale.

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,570
Also notice the range and the x, or the horizontal axis.

26
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,000
The range of the scaled variables are between 0 and 1.

27
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,889
Of course be careful, such that you don't have only one data point,

28
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:14,280
in which case you will get 0 for the denominator because your max and

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,650
min values will be equal.

30
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,860
Scaling the variables makes them computationally easier to deal with,

31
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,890
and easier to visualize.

32
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,805
Now we are going to look at correlations between two variables, but before we do

33
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:36,738
so, let's look at where we are in our questioning and model-building phase.

34
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:55,140
So far, we have inspected the various variables of interest in the data.

35
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,400
We have looked at the allowed amount, charged amount and the payment amounts.

36
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,200
Now we will ask the correlations.

37
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,640
In asking if the variables are correlated,

38
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,530
we can ask if the correlation in non-linear, or if the correlation is linear.

39
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,570
We can inspect this by looking at a scatter diagram of the variables.

40
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:28,471
Let us now inspect the scattered diagram of the two variables f1 and f2.

41
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,930
Notice that we have plotted both the variables after scaling them.

42
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,180
Once you are done, you should have a graph that looks very much like this.

43
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,030
The scatter plot of these two variables are very linear.

44
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,000
What we can conclude from that,

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,450
is that the paid amounts are directly proportional to the allowed amounts.

46
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:58,180
Similarly we can look at the scatter plot of f0 and f1.

47
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,570
In this case, although we have some correlation,

48
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,050
it is not as linear as it is between f1 and f2.

49
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,990
We want to have a quantitative measurement of the correlation between

50
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,570
two variables.

51
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,220
We have already observed from the scatter plot of f1 and f2,

52
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,840
that they're linearly correlated.

53
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,930
We can calculate what is called the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient.

54
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,030
Let's first define this quantity.
