>> It was ok.

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,769
I was visiting a friend in
San Francisco, but I got kind of lost.

4
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:14,360
>> Did you ever find your friend?

5

>> Eventually.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,430
It kind of took a while.

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,390

nice when you can find your way.

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,460
>> Yeah it's sort of
like learning to code.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,990
I remember learning my first language
and not really knowing what to do next.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,300
>> And that's why you're here.
