00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,540
So, for an exercise, if I give you the abstract state that looks like

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,580
a deposit of three, withdrawal of two, deposits of four and five and then

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,930
a withdrawal of six, I'd like you to give me the corresponding concrete state.
