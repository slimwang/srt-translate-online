1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is now ± ∞.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If you look at this, if you put a really large positive or negative value in,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the difference to any µ will be enormous.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The square will be even more enormous.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Therefore, this entire expression on the right side will be huge.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Put a minus sign in front of it, and you have a hugely negative number.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You have e^-∞.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
e^-∞ drive the e curve all the way to the left where this just ends up to be minimized.
