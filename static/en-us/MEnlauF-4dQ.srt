1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,719
To measure your lens
separation distance, or

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,380
LSD, all you need is a ruler and
your HMD.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,800
Take the ruler, and

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,190
align the zero millimeter mark with
the center of one of the lenses.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,950
Make sure your ruler goes
straight to the other lens.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,440
Now read the distance.

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,920
That value is your LSD.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,210
What did you get?
