00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,488
When I say basic emotions, I mean emotions that are shared by all humans in all

2
00:00:03,488 --> 00:00:08,015
cultures, no matter where you are in the world. Then we have other emotions

3
00:00:08,015 --> 00:00:12,182
that are more unique to the human condition. These are called self-conscious

4
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:16,426
emotions. Basic emotions are important for life tasks, such as protecting

5
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:21,318
ourselves from danger or achieving a goal. The basic emotions are fear,

6
00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:27,200
discussed, anger, happiness, sadness, contempt, and surprised. Notice that all

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,350
of these, except happiness and arguably sometimes surprise, are negative

8
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:36,080
emotions. That is they involve unpleasant subjective feelings. There're many

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,132
distinct negative emotions. For example, anger is very different from disgust,

10
00:00:40,132 --> 00:00:45,233
which is very different from fear or sadness. They all involve different

11
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:49,650
feelings and come from different things. On the other hand, happiness is

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,130
happiness and it's only just a little bit different from joy. The other set of

13
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,380
emotions, the self conscious emotions occur when we live up to or don't live up

14
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,917
to the expectations we set ourselves. The expectations of others or the rules

15
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:07,679
set by society. These emotions require us to be able to reflect on our own

16
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:12,238
behaviors. The self-conscious emotions are shame, guilt, humiliation,

17
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,070
embarrassment and pride.
