1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now for the answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What we need is an input in which quotes are contained within the tag.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
For instance, this could be an input like less than,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
double quote, double quote, and greater than.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If we go through the program, we would see that tag would be set,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
then quote would be set, then quote would be unset,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and then tag would be unset.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The output would be empty, and therefore would not contain any HTML markup.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Note, though, that this line would be executed

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and therefore also appear in the coverage.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And then we can simply say that execution of this line

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
directly is related to passing or failing.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So when given an arbitrary program, it is unlikely

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
that we will find lines that are only executed when the program fails.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And anyway, such lines would be found by the 1st test that executes them.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And we are pretty good at testing, aren't we?

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What we want to look for are lines that statistically correlate with failure.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That is, they may occasionally pass,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
but by and large, they more frequently fail than pass.
