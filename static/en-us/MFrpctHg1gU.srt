1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,010
So to summarize this overall architectural design process, phase zero

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,930
was specifying properties, and this involved constructing the context diagram.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,846
Indicating the external actors but only one activity the system itself.

4
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:18,430
We indicated external stimuli or events. That can affect the system.

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:23,514
We have the external actors being the user and the file system.

6
00:00:23,514 --> 00:00:27,380
We indicated how the system communicates its results back to the external actor.

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,281
Those are the percepts. And then we specified in English, the behaviors that you

8
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:36,406
want the system to have, and we used as starting point for that, used cases or

9
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:40,343
scenarios that we developed when we looked at the exercises at the start of

10
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:45,360
the term. In Phase 1 we componentized. Which meant decomposing the system into

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,760
components, reallocating responsibilities to them, for handling events and for

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,360
delivering percepts, and we assigned responsibility for the vary,

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,390
guaranteeing the various properties. In Phase 2 we chose an architectural style,

14
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,717
and that in turn specified how the components will interact. We chose a layered

15
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:08,715
implicit invocation architecture, we have assigned the components to layers,

16
00:01:08,715 --> 00:01:13,455
we determined the dependencies between the layers, we updated our guarantees,

17
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:19,140
we selected an invariant maintenance strategy, and we've assigned,

18
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,780
in doing so, that assigned responsibility for maintaining those invariants.
