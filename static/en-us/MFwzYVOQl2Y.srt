Hey Jessica here again with Project 2.5.

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:05,890
So last time,

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,170
you have about three that you're
ready to start working on.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,720
In the notes that follow, you'll
start developing a UI skeleton for

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,790
how users might interface with your app.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,040
And you'll use the skills that you just
learned in UI Kit Fundamentals to do so.

00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,610
Let's get started.
