1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:06,000
Now, gross profit amounts to your total
revenue minus your cost of goods sold.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,240
So that's answer B.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,870
Cost of goods sold may
also be a new term for

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,540
you and this refers to the costs
associated with making your product.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,060
For example, say your business
is selling water bottles,

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,410
and this is a water bottle, I promise.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,127
Now, you sell these water bottles for
$19.99.

8
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:29,260
But it costs you $5.60 to make them.

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,314
Your cost of goods sold is then this
$5.60 and when you subtract that from

10
00:00:34,314 --> 00:00:39,307
your total revenue per water bottle,
you get a remainder of $14.39.

11
00:00:39,307 --> 00:00:42,780
Also known as your gross
profit per water bottle.

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,540
Net profit is then your total
revenue after subtracting

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,370
all of your expenses as
an operating business.

14
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,440
Now, keep in mind that this
can easily be a net loss.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,210
And your goal is to implement
a monetization model that

16
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,410
keeps your numbers positive.
