1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,520
So now we know how to start with personas and

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,400
use cases to always keep our end user in mind.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,360
>> Yeah, it's really important to keep our

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,800
persona and use cases in mind, as designers

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,570
and developers when we're prioritizing feature lists, figuring

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,850
what to build, how to build it and when

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,450
to build it. Because if we don't do

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,030
that we fall into the trap of creating applications

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,410
either for no one or everyone, or just

10
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,900
for ourselves, both of which are really bad options.

11
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,900
>> I think we can really consider ourselves divine,

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,100
dev, design-minded developers at this point.

13
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,570
>> Yeah, exactly. So what's next in the process now that

14
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,790
we've talked about personas in each cases and prioritizing feature lists?

15
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,780
>> Well what we want to next is focus on next is low res wireframing.

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,940
We talked a little bit about that in lesson one, and we're going to go into

17
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,370
it more in lesson three. And lesson three

18
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,330
is going to be all about the mobile user,

19
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,410
because after all, we are building Android apps

20
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,580
and we need to start thinking mobile first.

21
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:48,880
>> Awesome.
