1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,469
So, that was a really
informative talk we just heard.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,300
>> Yeah, it sounds like there's
a lot of data in the shelter,

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,020
and there could be better ways
to capture it and access it.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,557
>> Yeah, I totally agree, and you know
what, this seems like the type of

5
00:00:11,557 --> 00:00:14,610
problem that mobile would be perfect for
helping solve.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,240
In this course, the students will get
to learn a powerful way to structure

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,910
the data, build an app that leverages
the structure to allow users, so

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,640
our staff in this case, to easily get
the information that you need for

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,740
each pet and be able to act on it.

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,770
>> Yes, so I think we can
go back to Udacity now and

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,860
try to build a prototype.

12
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:30,690
>> Yeah, great idea.

13
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,220
>> Okay, let's go, Jessica.

14
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,202
>> Just give me one second.

15
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:37,451

16
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:39,760
>> Jessica,
you're going to have to return Jacob.
