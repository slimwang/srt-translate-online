00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,836
This brings us to a very important consequence of stereotypes, and that's

2
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:08,954
called stereotype threat. Which are situations in which people are aware they

3
00:00:08,954 --> 00:00:13,715
belong to the minority, and this awareness negatively affects their performance

4
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:19,060
on a task. Let's look at this example of a research study done by Steele and

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,320
Aronson. The researchers have African-American and Caucasian students take a

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,250
test. Half of the students were asked to write their race at the top of the

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,570
test. Afterwards, they analyzed the results. Do you think they found a

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,495
difference between the group who wrote their race at the beginning of the test

9
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:41,321
as compared to those who did not? Yes or no? If you say yes, why? And if you

10
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:42,569
say no, why?
