00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,550
Everything has been nice and rectangular so far. We've modified both the

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,600
polygon and texture coordinates, but in such a way that these both always

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,313
formed some rectangle. Now it's time to see what happens when this

4
00:00:10,313 --> 00:00:14,222
correspondence is broken. In this new demo, we can move the locations and

5
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:17,662
change the positions and u v's of the two upper corners. Let's start by

6
00:00:17,662 --> 00:00:21,446
modifying the position of the upper right corner. You can see how this distorts

7
00:00:21,446 --> 00:00:25,520
the texture. Now let's change the u v coordinates. This also distorts the

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,679
texture, but in an inverted way. For example, as we make v larger, the texture

9
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,378
distorts in a manner similar to what we saw before. An increase of v instead of

10
00:00:34,378 --> 00:00:38,621
a decrease in the y coordinate causes this distortion. Try the demo yourself,

11
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:42,392
and see what various changes do. When you're done, I'll ask you a question

12
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:43,570
about what you saw.
