1
00:00:01,061 --> 00:00:02,847
All right! You're done.

2
00:00:02,847 --> 00:00:04,693
Let's take a look at my solution.

3
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:08,476
All right. So, here's what
our <i>addLocation</i> function looks like.

4
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:13,419
<i>locationSetting</i>, <i>cityName</i>,
latitude, and longitude.

5
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:15,423
Just like in our content provider test,

6
00:00:15,423 --> 00:00:18,875
we can use <i>getContentResolver</i>
to query based upon the content <i>URI</i>.

7
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:22,756
Remember that the default
location entry <i>CONTENT_URI</i>

8
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,152
passes all of the parameters
into the database.

9
00:00:25,152 --> 00:00:27,390
So we can easily construct a query

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,690
containing the <i>location</i> setting
to see if it's in the database yet.

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,559
If it's not, then the query
will return an empty set

12
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,580
and we should insert
the new city name, location setting,

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,203
latitude, and longitude
into the database together.
