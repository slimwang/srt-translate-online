1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,850
Okay, this is a messy one, that is
assuming I did something reasonable.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:05,630
Blah.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,420
I basically got the cube
root of a bunch of stuff.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,679
Stuff in this case is
2 times W-D over PD.

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,120
The exact answer isn't as important
as how you get there, so if you got

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,640
something different or the grading
robots didn't give you credit for

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,690
an equivalent expression, don't worry.

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,340
Okay, here's what I did.

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,220
First, I used Brent's theorem.

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,040
This gives an upper bound on time given
that we've slowed down the cores but

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,900
we get to use more of them.

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,960
The first sigma models slowdown,

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,965
the second sigma cubed models
the increase in processor cores.

14
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:37,785
Then I thought to myself,

15
00:00:37,785 --> 00:00:41,155
self, let's pick a sigma to
minimize the righthand side.

16
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:43,415
Let me give the righthand side a name.

17
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:47,175
G of sigma seems like a sufficiently
creative name for [INAUDIBLE] work, so

18
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:48,425
let's go with that.

19
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:52,810
To minimize g, let's return to
the dark recesses of Calc 101.

20
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,530
In particular, let's take the derivative
of g with respect to sigma.

21
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,860
We'll get something,
we'll set it to 0 and solve for sigma.

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,050
When you do that,
you basically get this mumbo jumbo.

23
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,760
You can also take a second derivative
of g just to verify that it's positive,

24
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,510
meaning that sigma is
really a minimizer.

25
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,370
The more interesting question is,
can you get a speed up?

26
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,890
And the answer depends
on the value of P.

27
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,560
But the short answer is, sometimes.

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,680
I'll leave figuring that out as
an additional exercise for you.
