1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
So Dave is also a computer scientist

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,160
just like Alice, Bob, and Carol,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,550
and he is working in Logistics,

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,410
and the problem that he is working on is

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,560
optimizing the delivery routes

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,850
for the mail trucks of his company.

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,660
So basically, the problem that Dave has to solve each day is the following:

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,890
Here's the headquarter of his company

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,840
where each day, the mail arrives,

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,190
so maybe the mail arrives by an airplane,

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,340
and that airplane delivers letters each day,

12
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,690
and then this delivery truck here

13
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,800
has to deliver those letters to all of the houses

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,230
that receive mail that day.

15
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,330
So let's say it's those 7 houses here where

16
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,080
this truck has to deliver the mail.

17
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,760
Now of course, the roads that connect the houses,

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,250
so not every house is connected to each other house directly,

19
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,700
and the roads also have different length,

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,610
and I'm going to specify this in minutes,

21
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,680
so if I write a 40 here, it means you need 40 minutes to get from

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,570
this house to this house,

23
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,610
and then 14 from this house to this house,

24
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,210
and 13 from this house to this house, and so on.

25
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,950
So you can already see that this looks very much like

26
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,380
a graph except that the edges now have

27
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,200
a certain distance or time attached to them.

28
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,470
Now the problem that Dave has to solve is a problem that we will call shortest tour.

29
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,520
We will say that as an optimization problem for now,

30
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,030
we will later work with the decision problem to show NP completeness of this problem.

31
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,220
The truck starts out here

32
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,520
at the headquarters,

33
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,090
and then, Dave is supposed to figure out

34
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,260
the fastest way for the truck to visit all houses

35
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,700
and then get back to the base, so it starts out here,

36
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,510
has to visit all houses.

37
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,350
It can visit a house more than once,

38
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,810
in case you're wondering, and then it has to get back to base.

39
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,380
So let's say the truck starts here

40
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,870
and let's say the first road it takes down is this one here.

41
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,340
What I would like you to tell me is

42
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,580
in which order should the truck

43
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,480
visit the other houses?

44
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,120
So this is the first house that the truck is visiting,

45
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,450
and I want you to enter a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 here,

46
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,700
so if the house travels from House 1 to House 2 then to House 2 and so on,

47
00:01:56,700 --> 99:59:59,999
it's taking the fastest possible route to visit all houses.
