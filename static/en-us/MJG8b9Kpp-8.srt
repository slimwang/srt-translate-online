00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,330
Okay, so now you can log into
your Linux machine, awesome.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,340
You've got a screen full of stuff, and

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,860
at the bottom you've got
a line with a $ at the end.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,380
That last line is the shell prompt, and
it means that the system is waiting for

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,110
you to give it a command.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,990
So just type something,
it doesn't matter what.

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,040
It can be anything.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,390
Just type something in and press Enter.

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,820
Huh, you probably got an error saying,
no such command, or

10
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,260
that program isn't installed,
or something like that.

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,220
And after that,
you got another shell prompt.

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,016
So just type in some random junk,
see what happens.

13
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:39,100
See if you can find anything that
doesn't make the shell prompt come back.

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,650
And when you do find something
that makes the shell prompt not

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,700
come back when you press Enter,
describe what it is you did here.
