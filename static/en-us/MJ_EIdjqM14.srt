00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
In the unit, we've been discussing fixed parameter tractable problems

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,570
and there are a lot of new things about these.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:12,910
First, the exponential part of the running time is restricted to the parameter k rather than

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:19,470
the parameter n, and at least in many cases k is much less than n.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:26,220
Another new thing is that they provably allow for some very effective pre-processing rules

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,530
and the details of some of these are a little bit out of scope for this course,

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:36,660
but we can get a bit of a taste for them by working at vertex cover and noticing a few key insights.

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,900
Now, let's say we have a graph G and suppose it has n vertices along with parameter k,

9
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:50,180
now what I'd like to know is does she have a vertex cover of size at most k.

10
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,570
So in other words, we were discussing the decision variant of the vertex cover problem.

11
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,730
Another way of saying this is that at most a certain number of vertices are needed

12
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:08,500
to cover all the edges and this could be either k-1, k, 2k, k+n, or n.

13
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,530
Another fact that this question or the answer to this question will imply is that if any vertex

14
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:20,840
is an endpoint to a certain number of edges or more, then it must be in the cover,

15
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:28,210
and this could be either k-1, k, k+1, 2k, or kÂ² edges.

16
00:01:28,210 --> 99:59:59,999
So for both of these questions, please check whichever on is most appropriate.
