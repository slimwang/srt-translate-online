1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,460
Your app is now in the state that
the saveProfile method knows

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,680
that when it is called, it should be
passed data that conforms to the fields

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,160
defined ProfileMiniForm class.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,735
Which in practical terms means that the
input data can include display name and

5
00:00:12,735 --> 00:00:13,880
teeShirtSize.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,040
If the input data includes any
other fields, they will be ignored.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,560
Since we also want to store
the user's email address,

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,480
we'll do that by getting the email
address of the logged in user.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,960
This of course means that
the user must be logged in.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,380
You can check that by calling
endpoints.get_current_user.

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,600
If that does not return to user object,
the user is not logged in.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,600
The endpoints system lets your
code handle this case by raising

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,890
an exception, which the front end
can handle by displaying an error or

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,820
redirecting to the log in screen.

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,020
So you don't have to change the
saveProfile method to get this behavior.

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,110
But instead work with
the getProfileFromUser method

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,020
where we used dummy data before.

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,540
Check out the TODO 2 comments.

19
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,120
Step 1,
make sure the user is authenticated.

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,540
If they're not, then we'll raise
the endpoints.UnauthorizedException.

21
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,730
Step 2, use the real data
from the logged in user

22
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,640
instead of the dummy data for
displayName and mainEmail.

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,610
Now there's one more thing to
change if you'd like to use

24
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,140
the app from the JavaScript based front
end, as well as from the APIs Explorer.

25
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,260
Take the same WEB_CLIENT_ID that
you used in settings.py and

26
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:21,690
put it in the JavaScript file app.js,
in place of this web-client-id here.

27
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,890
When you're done,
deploy your code on localhost and

28
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,690
test it, then deploy to appspot.

29
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,620
Check off each one of these boxes
as you finish that step and

30
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,250
then fill in your project ID down here.
