00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,667
Now that we know how we're able to store information, it's time to turn to the

2
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:08,087
next crucial part in the study of memory. And that's our ability to retrieve

3
00:00:08,087 --> 00:00:11,661
the information that we've stored. So retrieval is our ability to recall

4
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:17,324
information that's previously been stored in our memories. Remember we talked

5
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:21,660
about two different types of memory, Explicit and Implicit. And with Implicit

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,589
memory we can recall something without consciously trying to do so. I like to

7
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:30,759
tell my students an example of me trying to learn how to knit. I looked at

8
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,200
books and tried and tried to follow their examples to no avail. So I ended up

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,260
taking a lesson, and I had a teacher who showed me how to hold the knitting

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,605
needles. How to hold the yarn, and more importantly, how to wrap it around such

11
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:47,401
that I can make a knitted stitch. So I practiced and practiced my knitting and

12
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:52,745
I made several scarves. And then summer came and I put my knitting away. Now as

13
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:55,958
Christmas got closer, I thought it'd be really nice if I could knit each of my

14
00:00:55,958 --> 00:01:00,163
nieces a scarf. And then I realized, I'd forgotten all the rules my teacher

15
00:01:00,163 --> 00:01:05,288
taught me. But I did remember what I know about memory. And so I thought, just

16
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:09,980
maybe, if I pick up those knitting needles, my hands will remember what to do.

17
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,967
And that's exactly what happened. I picked up my needles and I started

18
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:17,452
knitting. So this is a good example of implicit memory, and more importantly,

19
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,020
procedural memory.
