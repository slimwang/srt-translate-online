00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,050
Here x equals negative 3. Excellent work if you found this number. This one was

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:10,818
tough. Now, the first thing to notice is that 125 is 5 raised to some exponent

3
00:00:10,818 --> 00:00:17,670
and 8 is 2 raised to some exponent. So let's rewrite this numbers with bases of

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:26,760
5 for 125 and a base of 2 for 8. So, 125 is 5 cubed and 8 is 2 cubed. Now, I

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,635
can pull out this third power to have 5 halves raised to the third. The

6
00:00:31,635 --> 00:00:35,582
left-hand side of the equation just stays the same. And notice we're so close

7
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:40,380
for these bases to be equal. We have 2 5ths on the left, but 5 halves on the

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:46,852
right. So, let's flip this base over. Let's do the reciprocal of it. Remember

9
00:00:46,852 --> 00:00:51,513
that to flip over a base, or to make 5 halves become 2 5ths, we raise it to a

10
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:59,951
power of negative one. So, this exponent of 3 becomes negative 3. Now we have

11
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:05,838
identical bases of two-fifths, so x must equal negative three. The key idea to

12
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:10,116
solving this problem is to remember to flip over or take the reciprocal of a

13
00:01:10,116 --> 00:01:14,541
base. To do that, we need a negative exponent.
