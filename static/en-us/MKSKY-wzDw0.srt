1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,640
So let's discuss some examples of VLIW processor.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,642
The most famous example of how to probably not

3
00:00:06,642 --> 00:00:10,300
do VLIW is Intel's Itanium processors. It has

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,970
tons of ISA features that help the compiler schedule

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,180
code well, etcetera. As a result, the hardware

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,250
of the processor became very complicated. It no longer

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,436
needed to check for dependencies between instructions, but it

8
00:00:23,436 --> 00:00:25,442
had so many other bells and whistles to do

9
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,215
this that the hardware is probably the most complicated

10
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:31,760
Intel ever belt. And yet fundamentally this is still

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,220
a VLIW processor, so it's still not doing great

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,000
on your regular code. Another example of where VLIW

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,550
is often used is DSP processors. What DSP stands

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,240
for, digital signal processing. Digital signal processing does a

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,520
lot of floating point work, typically in a very

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,510
regular loop with a very small amount of work within

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,908
each iteration and lots of, lots of iterations. So

18
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:56,916
typically, these types of processors on these types of

19
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,988
codes get excellent performance and are also very energy

20
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:03,316
efficient, because they don't spend much power on figuring

21
00:01:03,316 --> 00:01:07,078
out dependencies and so on. So these are examples

22
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:09,444
of when we try to use VLIW for all

23
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:13,155
types of codes, we run into problems. But if

24
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:15,634
we find the type of codes where compilers can

25
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:19,620
do well, suddenly VLIW looks like a very, very good choice for that.
