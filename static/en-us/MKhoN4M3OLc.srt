1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,599
So it turns out that, unfortunately, this is no useful approximation factor at all.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:10,266
And the reason for that is that the approximation factor depends on the size of the minimum vertex cover

3
00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:16,199
for the input graph. So the first thing to notice is, of course, that it's not a constant factor approximation algorithm,

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,866
because we can be given any graph, and that graph can, of course, have different size vertex covers.

5
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:24,499
Let's say we wanted this to be at least a factor two approximation algorithm.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:31,232
What that would mean is that one plus K over N minus 2k is smaller than or equal to two.

7
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:36,332
So when you solve this, what you get is that K must be smaller than or equal to N thirds.

8
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,432
Now, seeing this, you might be inclined to think, "Why isn't this answer here correct?"

9
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:45,232
Because if K, which is the size of the smallest vertex cover, is less than or equal to n thirds,

10
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:52,466
then most of the vertices are in an independent set, so the answer could be, if the independent set is very large,

11
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:58,799
then we also have a good approximation algorithm. But the problem of that is, of course, that in order to really

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,899
assess the quality of the approximation, you need to have an exact solution. And if you already have an exact solution,

13
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,699
then approximation, of course, makes no sense anymore. So it's an approximation factor that can only be determined

14
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,866
in hindsight once you have calculated an optimum solution, in which case you don't need the approximation anymore.

15
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:22,667
So this here is also not a correct answer, and the unfortunate thing is it's actually not a useful approximation at all.
