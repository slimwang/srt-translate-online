1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,430
So let's see if we can
classify some faults.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,910
If we have a phone and we get it wet and
we try to operate it in that state and

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,115
it heats up and finally explodes.

4
00:00:10,115 --> 00:00:15,170
So the phone getting wet is
what kind of fault by duration?

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,859
And what kind of fault by cause?

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,190
Also, let's say that the phone was
supposed to prevent itself from

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,250
operating when wet.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,500
It has a wetness sensor, and
it's supposed to not allow itself to be

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,680
turned on, so that you can just dry
it and then operate it normally.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,360
In that case heating up

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,510
when it got wet is a result of
what kind of fault by duration?

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,350
And what kind of fault by cause?
