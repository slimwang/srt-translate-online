00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:13,850
I need to edit the person again and I want to add another instance method. This

2
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:19,250
method is going to return the string with a friend. So let's return type a

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:42,480
string and all it has to do is return the value of friends. Now we can go back

4
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:50,990
and if we add Jamesha as a friend to Maria and then we get the friends of

5
00:00:50,990 --> 00:01:04,040
Maria. It returns Jamesha with a space just like we expected. I can create an

6
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:14,700
object for TJ as well. Add him as a friend to Maria and then unfriend Jamesha.

7
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,540
And now, if I get Maria's friends again, it just contains TJ. Looks like our

8
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,940
object is working pretty close to the way we expected. We can now encode a

9
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,792
social network using our Java program.
