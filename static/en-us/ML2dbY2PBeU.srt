1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,170
So far, we've been working
in the Tag Manager UI, but

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,140
now it's time to code our app to
use the daily special variable.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,610
So what we're going to do is
add the default container

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,200
to our Android Studio project.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,550
And the default container is
the thing that you just downloaded.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,740
So the default container contains the
initial values for the variables, but

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,230
we're going to want our code
to get the latest values.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,650
So we'll add code to download
the latest container into our app, and

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:35,820
we'll do that in the onCreate
Method in the main activity.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,620
It's important to save
a reference to the container so

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,538
that you can get hold of the container
from any other place in your app.

12
00:00:42,538 --> 00:00:45,090
And then throughout your app,

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,080
wherever you need, you get the container
and you get what you want out of it

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,050
by retrieving the value
of the relevant key.

15
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,544
And that's a simple get call.

16
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:59,819
Now then,all of these tasks, adding
the default container to a project and

17
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:02,960
writing this code,
are one time only tasks.

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,499
After you've done these steps, the only
thing you need to do when the special of

19
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:11,850
the day changes is to update the value
in Tag Manager and publish the change.

20
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,990
So the first thing is to find the file
that you downloaded from Tag Manager.

21
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,430
It likely starts with GTM and it will
probably be in your downloaded folder.

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,370
You're going to have to rename it.

23
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,820
The name must only have
lowercase letters and

24
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,610
underscores, no hyphens allowed.

25
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,980
For some reason the downloaded file
has capital letters and hyphens so

26
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,290
you definitely have to rename it.

27
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,770
You need to copy a file
into the raw folder

28
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,500
in the res folder in Android Studio.

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,043
And you'll need to
create the raw folder.

30
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,725
So the file that's now in the raw folder
holds the initial default value for

31
00:02:00,725 --> 00:02:03,070
everything in the Tag Manager container.

32
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,830
Usually, your app will

33
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,650
get what it needs from the latest
version of the container.

34
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,235
But it's required to
have a default container,

35
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:12,730
even if it's just an empty file.

36
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,520
Okay, go ahead and do these steps now.
