1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,010
So the numbers that I'm going to
give you here come from a report

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,040
in the first quarter of 2015.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,352
The CVV or 3 digit code we have
credit cards actually goes for

4
00:00:11,352 --> 00:00:13,600
$2, not very much.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,360
Credit card information, actually
there's a range for it depending on what

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:24,200
kind of credit card you have, so
this could go anywhere from $5 to $45.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,801
A PayPal or
Ebay account was going for $27.

8
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:34,800
And health information could be
obtained for $10 in the black market.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,110
So the exact numbers are not as
important as something that's striking.

10
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,030
These values are not very high,

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,240
well that's okay because
they have millions of these.

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,420
So if you take these values and
you multiply the two, you can see that

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,730
this could be an attractive thing for
a criminal who's out to make some money.
