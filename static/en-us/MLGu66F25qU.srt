00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,715
Surveys are one of the easiest ways to get info on a population. Sometimes it is

2
00:00:04,727 --> 00:00:09,446
really difficult to conduct the survey, but surveys are often a lot easier than

3
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:14,639
doing, say, a controlled experiment. They're also relatively inexpensive. They

4
00:00:14,651 --> 00:00:19,188
mostly just require time to implement, and for the respondents to write their

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,307
answers. Surveys can also be conducted remotely. You might have gotten a survey

6
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:29,084
in the mail at one point. And finally, this is my favorite thing about surveys.

7
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,947
Anyone can access and analyze survey results if the survey owner is willing to

8
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:39,150
give out that data. But assuming they are, the survey results are timeless. The

9
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:44,135
National Center for Education Statistics created this Education Longitudinal

10
00:00:44,147 --> 00:00:48,945
Study and thanks to them, I was able to look at factors that influence effort

11
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:53,820
including how much students enjoy school, or how much students value school, or

12
00:00:53,832 --> 00:00:58,485
their relationship with their teachers, their gender, and a bunch of other

13
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:03,010
things. it was really fun and interesting to analyze this data. Looking at

14
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:07,241
someone else's survey results can be a lot easier than conducting your own

15
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:07,644
survey.
