00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,550
So in the previous video, we described how the probability that our estimate for

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,730
beta deviates from the true value, is the following.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:13,160
The probability that x bar minus the true beta star is greater than epsilon,

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,970
is less than or equal to 1 divided by 4 and epsilon squared.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,090
We want to get a feel for

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,760
how many data points that we need to be able to say something with accuracy.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,650
Let's suppose that we want to deviate from the true beta by no more than 0.01.

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,560
And that the probability of that occurring should be no more then 10%.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,030
How many data points do we need?

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,750
