1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this next quiz I'd like you to extend your software to print out the optimal policy.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's happened over here.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
If we look at the grid, there's an obstacle over here.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There's a T-shaped obstacle over here.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The goal is in the bottom right corner.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Obviously to get the goal, over here you want to go down

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
as indicated by these v's over here--down, down, down, down, down.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Up here you'll want to go either right or down.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Down here, in this little dead end, you want to go left, left, then up, and then right again

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
into this passage over here, up again over here, right, and down, down, down.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The optimal policy is ambiguous.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Sometimes there are multiple optimal actions.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
For example, up here you go right or down.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
For other places like the ones over here, it's not ambiguous.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There's only one optimal thing to do, which is going down.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I want you to write code that outputs this policy,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which is in many ways very similar to the path output by A-star.
