00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,847
So you see that when we compare samples, we're simply extending the idea of the

2
00:00:03,847 --> 00:00:08,537
t test. We can compare samples to each other by seeing how far each sample mean

3
00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:11,843
is from the mean of means, or the grand mean, and this is between group

4
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:17,389
variability. But we also want to look at the variability of each sample, and

5
00:00:17,389 --> 00:00:22,518
that's within group variability. Because this impacts whether or not the

6
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:28,320
samples are significantly different. Since we're analyzing variabilities, this

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,068
process is called analysis of variance, shortened to ANOVA. ANOVA can compare

8
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:39,282
as many means as we want with just one test. We say one way ANOVA when we have

9
00:00:39,282 --> 00:00:44,952
one independent variable sometimes called a factor. In this course we'll only

10
00:00:44,952 --> 00:00:46,964
work with one way ANOVA.
