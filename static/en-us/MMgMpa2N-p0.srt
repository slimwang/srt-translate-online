1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,140
We have our settings screen,
but no settings.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,510
In the next several sections, you're going
to be adding our two settings.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,400
I'll walk you through how we add
our first setting for location,

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,780
then you'll do the temperature setting
on your own, so listen closely.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,268
First, we design a Preference XML file.

6
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:19,010
The root element should be
a PreferenceScreen.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,560
In this example,
we have a CheckBoxPreference

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,860
and a ListPreference inside of it.

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,090
In order to add
the Preferences XML file to our app,

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,570
we first need to create an XML folder
under the resources res directory.

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,360
Right-click on the res folder,
go to New / Android resource directory,

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,530
and then type in xml
as the name of the directory.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,575
For resource type you can use xml
and then hit OK.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,510
Inside this folder, we right-click
to create a new XML Resource File.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,720
We call it pref_general,

16
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,990
and the Root element is a PreferenceScreen
as we saw on the developer's site.

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,020
And then our Preferences file is created.

18
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,980
Then, add the location preference.

19
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,730
Since the wireframes showed
an editable text field

20
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,318
to input user location as a string,
we make this an EditTextPreference.

21
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:10,620
If you want to learn more about all
the possible XML attributes,

22
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,370
you can Google for EditTextPreference.

23
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,760
First, we specify a title
for the preference,

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,060
which will be the label
that's displayed to the user.

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,040
Then, we specify a key.

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,690
And this key is actually
the Key Value in SharedPreferences.

27
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:30,010
Going back to the code, we also add these
attributes to describe the Edit Text field

28
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,140
in the pop up dialog that was shown
in the wire frames.

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,603
Going back to the code,
we can also configure properties

30
00:01:36,603 --> 00:01:38,226
of the Edit Text field.

31
00:01:38,226 --> 00:01:42,780
We specify the input type to be text,
and we cap it to a single line of text.

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,790
It's bad practice to hard code
these strings here,

33
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,250
so we declare them as constants
in the strings.xml file.

34
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,970
These are the strings we declared.

35
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,520
This is the name of the label
of the preference.

36
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,290
It's user-visible, so we add a char limit
for translation purposes.

37
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,840
You also specify location, which is
the name of the key in Shared Preferences.

38
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,360
We don't want to translate it because
we always want to find the key

39
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,060
based on this name.

40
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,169
We also specify a constant
for the default location.

41
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,710
We also don't translate this
because we need to send it

42
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,750
to the server API like this.

43
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,950
When you're done with these steps,
check them off and continue.
