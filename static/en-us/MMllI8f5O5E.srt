1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,309
So picture a robot like the self-serving
car in the desert, adjusting its speed.

2
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:07,740
It'll do it based on some
features we can observe, and

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,349
the features we chose as
an example are just two of them.

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,366
There's the steepness of the terrain,
whether it's flat or

5
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:14,476
whether it's a hill.

6
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:17,505
And then there's the ruggedness of the
terrain, how much the vehicle bobs up

7
00:00:17,504 --> 00:00:20,349
and down, which we can
actually measure inside a car.

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,502
And what we do is we're
going to set up an example but

9
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:25,615
you're going to be the machine learning
specialist and you will learn.

10
00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:28,498
We'll help Stanley decide
whether to go fast or

11
00:00:28,498 --> 00:00:31,120
slow using supervised machine learning.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,810
So, let's dig in.
