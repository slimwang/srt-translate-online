One interesting way we learned about babies' vision and depth perception is

2
00:00:03,232 --> 00:00:08,138
with the visual cliff task. And that's this. The researcher puts the baby on

3
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:11,734
one end of the platform, and then there's a piece of plexiglass on the other

4
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:17,168
side. This is so it looks like visual cliff. Then, the researcher asks the mom

5
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:21,738
to stand on the other side of the plexiglass, so she would stand here. And she

6
00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:25,452
would call the baby to come to her. What do you think the baby would do? Type
