00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,280
Let's take a minute to look at reliability in blackboard architectures.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,600
In a blackboard architecture,

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,160
the independence of the components can increase system resilience.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,260
That is, the system may continue to function in a degraded fashion if one of

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,700
its components breaks.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,450
On the other hand, because there is no overall definition of system behavior, it

7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,260
may be difficult to identify the cause of a problem when something goes wrong.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,928
As far as an advantage is concerned, access control and

9
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:31,150
the blackboard architecture's enhanced because there's a common data repository.

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:32,810
On the other hand,

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,630
the flexibility of a blackboard architecture allows for the dynamic condition of

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,210
new components which may reduce confidence in overall system security.
