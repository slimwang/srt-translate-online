1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:02,257
We'll take advantage of what 
the framework offers

2
00:00:02,257 --> 00:00:04,534
in order to build our SettingsActivity.

3
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:06,820
Since we're supporting 
Gingerbread devices,

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,772
we'll use a preference activity class.

5
00:00:08,772 --> 00:00:10,528
If you're targeting Honeycomber later,

6
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:12,985
you'll want to use 
the PreferenceFragment class.

7
00:00:13,098 --> 00:00:16,923
Create a new SettingsActivity class 
from the gist provided below.

8
00:00:17,303 --> 00:00:21,205
Update the AndroidManifest 
to declare this new activity.

9
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:25,550
You can see the way detail activity 
is declared as an example.

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,273
If you see that APIs are deprecated, 
that's okay. That's a side effect

11
00:00:29,273 --> 00:00:34,014
of using PreferenceActivity, 
in order to target Gingerbread devices.

12
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:36,799
When you create your app 
for your final project,

13
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,977
you can use the wizard in Android Studio
to create a new SettingsActivity.

14
00:00:41,245 --> 00:00:44,573
The code the wizard provides 
will make your app backward compatible,

15
00:00:44,573 --> 00:00:47,159
by using a combination 
of preference activity

16
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:49,087
and PreferenceFragment.

17
00:00:49,087 --> 00:00:51,668
Our gist is meant to be 
a simplified version of that

18
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:55,073
for learning purposes. So later, 
you'd be able to understand better

19
00:00:55,073 --> 00:00:56,763
what the wizard is doing.

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,784
Check these items off 
when you're done.
