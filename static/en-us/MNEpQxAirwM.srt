1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,210
So when a new conference is created,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,100
there might be a variety of
tasks that need to be executed,

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,340
such as starting the process to book
the venue, or creating the agenda,

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,922
organizing the catering, or sending
a confirmation email to the organizer.

5
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:15,850
You want to do all of these tasks in the
background, rather than try to complete

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,820
everything before the create
conference function returns.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,660
In this exercise, you're going
to use the default task queue to

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,250
send the confirmation email when
someone creates a conference.

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,590
The learning goal is to understand
how to use task queues.

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,250
But you can imagine there are many
other tasks that need to be completed

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,060
when a new conference is created.

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,770
To execute a task in
the background using a task queue,

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,430
the first thing you need to do
is define the work to be done.

14
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,860
It's up to you to write
the code to execute the task.

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,950
This can be in a separate handler or
an endpoints method, or

16
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,150
anywhere else that can
be accessed by a URL.

17
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,280
We've provided the email sending code,
however, so

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,720
you can focus on thinking about queues.

19
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,150
An optional thing you might want to
do is configure queue in queue.yaml.

20
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,338
One exception is that if you're
using the default queue,

21
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:57,090
then you don't need to
do any configuration.

22
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,284
You'll use the default
queue in this case.

23
00:00:59,284 --> 00:01:02,700
But you can check the documentation for
configuration options.

24
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,420
And then you'll need to write
code to add tasks to the queue.

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,920
Using the default task queue
in Python is pretty easy.

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,330
To end queue a task,
you'll call the taskqueue.add function.

27
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,970
In this simple case, you only need
to provide the URL to use and

28
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,590
additional parameters that
you want to pass to that URL.

29
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,350
In this case, you at least want
the user's email to send to,

30
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,290
and the conference information.

31
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,020
If you're going to use
the non-default queue,

32
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,270
you'd also pass in
the queue name as well.

33
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,850
You can also set other configuration
options such as the name of the task,

34
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,880
the HTTP method,
retry options and so forth.

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,730
Once you've implemented all this,
deployed to appspot and added a new

36
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,500
conference to kick off the process, you
can then go to the developer console and

37
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,600
look at the queues and
tasks and their status.

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,430
As well as delete tasks that
are currently in a queue, etc.

39
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,840
One thing to remember is that unless
you specified how many times to

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,800
retry a task,
if you specified an incorrect URL,

41
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,450
it will retry indefinitely so
test your queues carefully.

42
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,195
And now it's your turn to add
task queues to your application.

43
00:01:58,195 --> 00:02:00,415
We've provided most of the code
in the additions folder,

44
00:02:00,415 --> 00:02:02,915
under todo2,
you just have to put it all together.

45
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:05,035
See the TODO 2 comments
in the relevant files.

46
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:09,830
You'll need to modify app.yaml,
main.py, and conference.py.
