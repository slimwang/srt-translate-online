00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,001
Let's go through the wire frames
for the Settings UI.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,808
Within the detail activity 
in the overflow menu,

3
00:00:05,808 --> 00:00:07,670
there's a Settings menu item.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,755
When you tap on the Settings' menu item,
it opens up the settings activity.

5
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:14,495
If you tap of location, 
it pops up a dialog,

6
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:17,063
where you can enter in your postal code.

7
00:00:17,078 --> 00:00:21,801
Feel free to use your preferred method
for inputting location, such as city name.

8
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:24,667
Just verify that the data 
coming back from the server

9
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,413
is for the location you expect.

10
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:30,053
Note that there's no validation
on this string input.

11
00:00:30,053 --> 00:00:32,506
If you're trying to make this app
a production app,

12
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:35,179
you would want some kind 
of error handling here.

13
00:00:35,813 --> 00:00:38,946
If you tap on <i>pick your units,</i>
it opens up a dialogue

14
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:41,782
where you can choose to display
temperature within the app

15
00:00:41,782 --> 00:00:44,057
as either <i>metric</i> or <i>imperial units.</i>

16
00:00:44,057 --> 00:00:46,603
This is basically just Celsius or Fahrenheit,

17
00:00:46,603 --> 00:00:48,479
and that is what this settings activity does.

18
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:51,320
Remember that you don't want to make
everything a setting.

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,415
If you're discussing a feature 
with a teammate

20
00:00:53,415 --> 00:00:55,108
and you can't decide on something,

21
00:00:55,108 --> 00:00:57,993
don't compromise 
by just making it a user setting.

22
00:00:57,993 --> 00:01:01,538
There are instances where making 
a difficult product decision now

23
00:01:01,538 --> 00:01:04,696
will be better for the user, because then
they won't have the burden

24
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:07,555
of having to decide what the value
of the setting should be.

25
00:01:07,555 --> 00:01:11,004
And remember, there's always
an opportunity in an app update

26
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,500
to add the setting later.

27
00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:14,247
If you add it to begin with,

28
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:16,472
it's infinitely harder 
to take away the setting

29
00:01:16,472 --> 00:01:19,225
because some users 
might get angry with you.

30
00:01:19,744 --> 00:01:22,821
If you're having trouble deciding 
if something should be a setting or not,

31
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:25,990
you can check out the setting section
in the Android design guide,

32
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,274
which is linked below.

33
00:01:27,274 --> 00:01:30,173
It contains a workflow diagram 
that could help you.

34
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,247
Very few roads often lead 
to making something a setting.
