00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,290
We've looked at multiplying identical bases together, as well as different bases

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,285
together, now let's look at powers of powers. I have a base raised to a power,

3
00:00:08,285 --> 00:00:12,338
and then that quantity, raised to another power. We're going to try and come up

4
00:00:12,338 --> 00:00:16,652
with an exponent rule to handle these. This cubed power indicates I should write

5
00:00:16,652 --> 00:00:21,080
2 cubed multiplied by itself 3 times, so I write that here. Now we can expand

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,159
each of these and write our final answer as two to some power. So what do you

7
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:31,001
think that would be? Can you write the expressions with one base and one

8
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:34,243
exponent here? Do the same for these problems.
