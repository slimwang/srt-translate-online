00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
There are lots of different types of databases,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and we're going to focus on kind of the major ones.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We've got one type of databases that are called relational databases

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that often use a language called SQL to manipulate them,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and so we'll refer to these as relational databases or SQL databases.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Some examples of relational databases are postgreSQL,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
which we use that in Reddit.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We currently use that in Hipmunk, and lots of people use this.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It happens to be my favorite.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
There's MySQL, which is extremely popular,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and this is used by Facebook

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and basically everybody.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Not strictly everybody, but MySQL is far and away the most popular database,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and I'm sure you will encounter it in your web development adventures.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Also pretty common is SQLite, which you'll actually use in this class.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is a really lightweight, simple database.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's not for working on huge amounts of data, like postgreSQL and MySQL might be.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's generally better as a replacement for where you would normally use flat files

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
but really handy, and of course, there's also Oracle,

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
which is a huge company that sells the Oracle database product.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And incidentally, Oracle bought MySQL a number of years ago

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
but has largely left it free and open.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
These are all free.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And these databases all basically work with tables.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
They use a language called SQL to manipulate those tables,

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and we're going to talk about that in this class a fair amount,

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and in our general purpose, handy things.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There are other databases in the world.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Some examples might be Google App Engine's Datastore,

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
which is what we're going to be using a lot in this class,

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and it's got a lot of similarities with these relational databases,

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
but also a lot of differences, and we'll spend a fair amount of time

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
talking about these differences.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Dynamo, which is by Amazon, and the reason I mention this

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
is because there is a great paper online that describes how this database works,

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and I'll include it in the course notes.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's worth a read.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's a really nice approach, and they take a completely different approach

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
from these SQL databases, and there's a lot to learn there.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
There's the NoSQL databases.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Of these, maybe Mongo is pretty popular.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Couch is pretty popular.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We're not going to discuss these much in this class,

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
but these are products that try to solve some of the limitations

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
that SQL places on you that we'll get to in a moment.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But in this class, we're going to focus on kind of the basics of SQL

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and then Google App Engine's Datastore and how to use those

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
to build your web apps.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay, quick quiz. Which database is the best?
