1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,440
Let's try cross-tabing in Alteryx.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,990
But before we do this,
let's count the schools by zip code and

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,770
level description to see what that
would look like in the summarize tool.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,840
When we look at the result,
we can see that the data

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,740
is showing counts of schools by
zip code and by level description.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,700
But what we're trying to achieve is
to create new fields out of the level

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,750
description values that count
the number of schools in each

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,021
of those categories by zip code.

9
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:33,723
To do this,
we'll use the cross-tab tool.

10
00:00:33,723 --> 00:00:34,643
[BLANK_AUDIO]

11
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:39,980
After attaching the cross-tab tool,
we'll set it up.

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,400
The group data by these
values represents what we

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,200
want to see at the record level.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,170
In this case, it's zip codes.

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,250
The new column headers represents
the fields that will be

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,590
created from the values
in that column of data.

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,890
So if we want to see one field for

18
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,848
each level description,
then we select LevelDesk here.

19
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:10,710
Next, in the values for new columns,
we need to select a numeric field so

20
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,990
account can be generated for
each of the records.

21
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,030
We'll select Enrollment.

22
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:21,690
In the method for aggregating values,
we'll select Count [without Nulls],

23
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,440
which counts the number of
records without null values.

24
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:30,410
The end result have the level
descriptions listed across the top and

25
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,530
the zip codes along the side, along with

26
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:38,430
the individual counts of schools that
fall in each of these categories.

27
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,220
We can easily remove the count
prefix in the Select tool.

28
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,410
We select the fields that we
want to remove the prefix for.

29
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,880
Go to Options &gt; Remove Prefix, and

30
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,609
select Remove "Count_".

31
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:57,727
When we run the workflow, [SOUND],

32
00:01:57,727 --> 00:02:01,679
we can see that that word count
has been removed from the fields.

33
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:03,129
