00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,220
Let's look at our authentication quiz.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,430
You should check the answer from
the choices that we have here.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:12,360
And this question really is talking
about a lot of devices that we have.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,610
Those are our personal devices.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,330
So the device,
it's your smartphone or your laptop.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,080
And they're not shared
between many different users.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,670
Even in this case,
we do use authentication.

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,860
So in a smartphone you may have a PIN or
a pattern to unlock it.

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,040
On your laptop you may have to type
a password to gain access to it and

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,230
things like that.

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,780
So if it's not shared and

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,500
we don't have multiple users,
why do we have authentication here?
