00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,981
Like I mentioned before, it's often useful to think about absolute value in

2
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:08,064
terms of distance on a number line. Here, I've marked the points 5 and 14. So,

3
00:00:08,064 --> 00:00:12,056
if I want to count from 5 up to 14, it's going to take me 9 spots. The same is

4
00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:16,071
true if I want to count from 14 back to 5. It's going to take me 9 places along

5
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:20,818
the number line to get there. So once you get from negative 12 to 5, I can see

6
00:00:20,818 --> 00:00:25,481
with my number line that it is going to take me. I'll spare you counting, 17

7
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:30,240
steps. Considering we know that this distance is 17, which of these following

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,390
absolute value expressions shows that distance?
