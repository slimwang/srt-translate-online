00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,700
Here, I think it's easiest to complete the square. And it turns out when we

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,600
solve to complete the square, we get the answers, negative 5 plus or minus root

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,666
22. Great thinking if you got these answers. Keep in mind that you could have

4
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:16,558
also used the quadratic formula to solve this equation. But since the a here is

5
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:21,151
one and RB is even, I think it's easiest to complete the square. We subtract 3

6
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:24,543
from both sides, in order to get x squared plus 10x alone on the left-hand side

7
00:00:24,543 --> 00:00:29,420
of the equation. Now, we can complete our square. We add b over 2 squared to

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,497
both sides, which is 25. Now that we've added 25 to both sides, we can rewrite

9
00:00:34,497 --> 00:00:39,670
the left side as the quantity x plus 5 squared. The right hand side just

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,314
simplifies to 22. We take the square root of both sides of the equation to get

11
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:49,518
x plus 5 equals positive or negative root 22. Then, to isolate x, we simply

12
00:00:49,518 --> 00:00:52,150
subtract 5 to get our final answers.
