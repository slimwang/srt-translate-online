1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,630
Let us look at adaptation
a little bit more deeply.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,740
So once again here is the process
of case-based reasoning.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,860
I have kind of blurred
the retrieval step.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,380
We're going to assume here that
the retrieval of the case has already

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,430
occurred, perhaps using the KNN
method that we discussed last time.

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,420
Last time we also said two other things.

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,300
One, that a fundamental conundrum that
AR agent faces that the problems they

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,350
encounter are usually very complex
from a computational perspective.

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,220
And they have only limited
calculative resources.

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,530
So then how can they address
computationally complex problems,

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,493
with limited calculative resources,
in near real-time?

12
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,939
Seemingly effortlessly.

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,370
And we said part of the answer might
be that memory supplies with an answer.

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,200
But we are going to make
a small amendment to it.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,690
Memory supplies with an answer,
an almost correct answe,r so

16
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,600
that the adaptation that we have
to do is very small, very minor.

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,070
It's a tweak.

18
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,140
As an example of adaptation
being mostly tweaking,

19
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,660
consider this simple problem,
the everyday problem of cooking meals.

20
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,410
So you may have a recipe for
your favorite kind of meal.

21
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,560
And imagine at this time you're going
to have your favorite meal, perhaps

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,890
with different company, or perhaps with
a different kind of salad or appetizer.

23
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,780
Well in that case you might tweak
your recipe for that particular dish.

24
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,200
You're not going to change
it in a radical way,

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,680
you're simply making
a small change to it.

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,790
>> So, Ashoke, another example of this
that comes to mind very readily for me,

27
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,210
goes back to your programming
example from earlier in this lesson.

28
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,170
One thing that almost every
program I write has to

29
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,270
do is input data from a file.

30
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,490
But right now, I couldn't write
that process from scratch.

31
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,900
What I always do is I look at however
I did it the previous time, and

32
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,500
I'll modify it for the new folder or

33
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,250
the new kind of data or
the new kind of file I'm reading from.

34
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,750
But really I'm just taking the same
process and tweaking it for

35
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,080
my new problem.

36
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,900
>> That's a good point, David.

37
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,020
In fact in the design commonly
there's an old cliche,

38
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,020
which says that all designers redesign.

39
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,600
Design is fundamentally evolutionary,
we take all designs and

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,090
we evolve them slightly and
that's how we get a new design.

41
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,199
And the same thing is happening
in case-based reasoning here.

42
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,470
It is saying that often this
particular solutions that we

43
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,610
come up with are revolutionary in
the nature in the sense that they

44
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,920
are small tweaks over
previous solutions.

45
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,320
So the next question becomes,

46
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,250
how can we adapt an old case to meet
the requirements of new problem?

47
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,510
There are potentially
several ways of doing it.

48
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,930
We will discuss three important ways,

49
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,310
perhaps the three most common
ways of adapting a case.

50
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,495
They are called the model-based method,

51
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:37,900
the recursive case-based method,
and the rule-based method.
