After you have prepared your game for
display in an app store, you should

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,060
decide whether you want your app to be
available locally or internationally.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,480
If you do want to go international,
you'll definitely want to localize.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,600
Localization means changing
pieces of your game so

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,470
that they fit in the language and
culture of different locations.

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:26,520
This can include changing the currency
or the language of any game text.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,970
This can help encourage people around
the world to download your game.

Let's see how you can include
translation in the code of your game.
