00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,540
We have seen that the ROB changes when we free the reservation stations. Let's

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:11,120
see if we understand that. Suppose that we have a situation where an instruction

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,730
cannot issue because there is no available reservation station for

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,960
it. When is this more likely to happen? When we have a processor

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,360
with normal Tomasulo's algorithm, no reorder buffer, and we have 2 add and

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,960
2 multiply reservation stations, or when we have a processor that does have

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,840
a ROB and has the same number of reservation stations.
