00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:03,887
Okay, congratulations on finishing unit 2. Let's recap what we've learned.

2
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:07,790
So you learned about how threads communicate with each other through memory and how

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,179
they can access that memory efficiently when operating in concert.

4
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:14,699
Along the way, we've learned a few things about the GPU hardware, like its memory model,

5
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,570
and what assumptions we can and cannot make about when threads will run.

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,230
Now you'll have a chance to put those concepts into practice.

7
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:24,659
You'll implement a simple image blurring operation. Jen Hahn will tell you more.
