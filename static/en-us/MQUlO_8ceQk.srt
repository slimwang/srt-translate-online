00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,230
The right answer is four times. And I

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,220
sort of walked through that for you hopefully

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,190
you got that. Basically, the kernel has to

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,610
copy from the client address space into the kernel

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,980
buffer. That's the first copy. The second copy

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,770
is, the kernel has to copy from the kernel

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,550
buffer into the server. And then the third

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,390
time when the procedure is completed, the server procedure

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,110
is completed, the kernel has to copy it from the server address

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:34,010
using the kernel, and then the fourth time, it's going to be copied from

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,020
the kernel buffer into the client. So it's tough being moved from

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,410
the user address space... Through the kernel and back out happens four times.
