Here's my answer.

2
00:00:01,563 --> 00:00:06,225
First, the client sends an HTTP
request to the server using the method

3
00:00:06,225 --> 00:00:08,608
flickr.galleries.getPhotos.

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:11,720
The server responds with the JSON
containing information about photos in

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,160
the gallery.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,865
Then the client stores the JSON, and

7
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:18,855
it randomly picks the URL
of an image in the gallery.

8
00:00:18,855 --> 00:00:23,415
Then the client requests an image and
its data using the URL.

9
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:27,285
Next, once the URL returns,
the client displays the image.

10
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:30,355
And if the button's pressed,
will go back to step one.

11
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:32,155
I may have left out some
of the in-betweens, but

12
00:00:32,155 --> 00:00:33,755
this is a good picture
of what's happening.
