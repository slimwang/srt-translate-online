00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,810
As we've said, health informatics
serves healthcare delivery,

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,440
the translation of medical knowledge
into the care of actual patients.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,350
Its key components are electronic
medical records, which are created and

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:19,070
used by licensed professionals, patient
generated personal health records.

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,470
And a technology called
Health Information Exchange

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,490
that can be used to share information
among providers and patients

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,960
in order to aggregate information
to create a more comprehensive and

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,760
holistic electronic health record,
to manage patient populations and

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,040
the public health at large and
to support research of various kinds.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,780
Accomplishing this data exchange demands
technologies to assure privacy and

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,470
security of health data
as required by law.

12
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,410
And other technologies
to define standards so

13
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,460
that data from diverse sources
can be meaningfully combined.
