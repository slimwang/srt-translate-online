1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So once again, it's time to summarize what we've learned in this unit.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Just as English sentences could be broken up into words,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
so can HTML and JavaScript be broken up into tokens,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
typically separated by spaces.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Some of the more complicated token types we looked at were number, word, and string.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Since these correspond to sets of strings, we use regular expressions to specify them.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I've introduced you to JavaScript and showed you how to use regular expressions

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to specify core parts of HTML and JavaScript.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In the homework for this unit, you'll be given a chance to expand on that knowledge.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It'll be fun!

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In our next exciting episode, we're going to continue our slow but steady progress

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
towards an HTML + JavaScript interpreter. Fun stuff!

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hope you join me next time.
