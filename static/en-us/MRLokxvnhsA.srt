1
00:00:00,694 --> 00:00:04,227
So the most important thing to remember when we say a problem is NP complete

2
00:00:04,227 --> 00:00:08,045
is the NP-completeness equation which says that

3
00:00:08,045 --> 00:00:15,078
NP-Complete means that a problem is in NP and

4
00:00:15,078 --> 00:00:17,794
its NP-Hard.

5
00:00:17,794 --> 00:00:19,127
Alright, so based on that

6
00:00:19,127 --> 00:00:23,695
knowing that graph partition is NP-Complete means that Yes, graph partition is NP-hard.

7
00:00:23,695 --> 00:00:27,362
And based on what we said about NP-hardness, a polynomial time solution

8
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:30,511
to graph partition would solve everything in NP.

9
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:37,861
We also know specifically that any problem like clique that we know is in NP can be reduced to it.

10
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:41,695
so a solution to graph partitioning would solve clique specifically.

11
00:00:41,695 --> 00:00:45,546
From this part of the NP-completeness equation

12
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:46,811
we know that graph partitioning is in NP.

13
00:00:46,811 --> 00:00:51,510
And from what we know about NP means that an exponential time solution exists to graph partitioning

14
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,060
And that it can be reduced to SAT. If somebody could solve SAT for us that would also let us solve graph partitioning.

15
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:06,547
So we actually know all of these things by virtue that graph partitioning is NP-complete.
