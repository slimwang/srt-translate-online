1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,170
It seems like it is important,
but is it important only for

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,000
companies, or is it really important for
every one of us?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,620
So to make this point,
we actually going to do a quick quiz.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,620
These are companies that you and
I patronize.

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:21,020
And all of them actually, unfortunately,
have suffered data breaches, which means

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,850
data they have about their customers
was stolen by somebody malicious.

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,466
So the quiz is really just asking you to
check all the companies that you have

8
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:31,791
done business with.
