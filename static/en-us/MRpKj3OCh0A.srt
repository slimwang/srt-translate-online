1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,560
In the last few lessons,
we learned all about persistence.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,459
>> By persistence,

3
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:08,240
do you mean the determination that it
took our students to get through three

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,460
lessons without changing anything
about the way sunshine works?

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,170
>> Yes, but we also learned about
persisting data in databases and

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,820
reading and writing that data using
a content provider interface.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,940
>> Lots and lots of code.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,000
So it's time to put some of that
hard work to real use in sunshine?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,620
>> Indeed, we've gotten the database and
content provider working against a test

10
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,390
framework, but now it's time to
connect it up to your application.

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,750
>> But we're not going to just do that.

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,439
We're going to use that content provider
and database to store information

13
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:43,119
that the app collects when
running in the background.

14
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,750
>> After all, the best kind of
application is one that has

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,630
critical information available,
even when you may not be on a network.
