1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,719
So we can look at this ellipse a little more carefully, okay.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,970
Let's first consider the case, where the gradient at

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:15,340
every point in the image, is either horizontal or vertical.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,510
Sorry, not in the image in the window.

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,360
So, at each point.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,390
It could be horizontal or

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,910
it could be vertical, but it's not going to be slanted, okay?

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,590
So some places it'll be horizontal, some places it'll be vertical, but

9
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:33,460
it's never, the, both Ix and Iy are never non-zero at the same time.

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,980
Well, that would mean that these terms would always be 0, right.

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,100
Ix times Iy, all right.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,050
So, that would look like this.

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,290
And I'm writing this as lambda one, lambda two, these are the diagonal terms.

14
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,530
The off diagonals would be 0.

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,600
Now, that's a nice full right matrix, right, lambda one, lambda two.

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,090
Except if one of those were 0, it would not be a very good full,

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,070
it would not be a full rank equation, right?

18
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,319
So for example, if the Iy squareds were all 0 and

19
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:10,490
that there was no gradient in the Y direction, only in the horizontal direction,

20
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:15,330
that would mean that my matrix would only have one of these values, and

21
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,930
probably, that's not really a good corner, right?

22
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,700
Because if I only have say gradient in this way and

23
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,960
not in that way, then I can slide up and down as much as I want.

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,620
So, something about these numbers tells us how good a corner,

25
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,780
the location in the image is.

26
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,660
Can you smell the algorithm that's coming?

27
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,080
It's not me, it's Megan.

28
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,870
In fact, I'll write it just this way.

29
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:42,620
If either of those lambdas were close to 0, this is not a corner.

30
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,358
So what we want is we want,

31
00:01:44,358 --> 00:01:47,820
is we want to look for locations where both of those are large.

32
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,090
Now for those of you who remember from your calculus and and you're learning

33
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,650
algebra, of course, we can take this second order matrix, this ellipse,

34
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,190
and what we can do is we can diagonalize it through a rotation, and remember we

35
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,300
talked about singular value decomposition, well this is not exactly that but

36
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,330
it's quite related, where basically, what it says is we can think of M which is

37
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,960
that special matrix as being sort of rotated or unrotated by R.

38
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,950
Then it's a diagonal matrix and then it's re-rotated.

39
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,160
The axis lengths of those ellipses, okay how big those ellipses are,

40
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,030
that's determined by the eigenvalues these numbers.

41
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,520
Of that diagonalization, and

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,130
the orientation of the ellipse is determined by that rotation.

43
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,790
So here I'm drawing that, like this, so remember,

44
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,830
this is a particular ellipse of constant E, constant error.

45
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,870
So for places where, it's a very narrow ellipse.

46
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,620
That means that the E changes quickly.

47
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,820
I didn't have to move very far for the E to get to that value.

48
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,070
Whereas, the places where it goes very slowly, okay,

49
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:03,680
I have to move a farther distance, in order for that value to change.

50
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,480
And you see how it says it's one over the, the square root?

51
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,140
So, remember, if that lando were 0, okey?

52
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,200
That would mean I'd have to go an infinite direction,

53
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,120
that means it doesn't change at all as I move in that direction.

54
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,190
So what I'm telling you here is that the eigenvalues, of that M matrix,

55
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,690
are indicative of the cornerness of that matrix.

56
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,350
That's pretty cool.

57
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,490
So, it turns out, Harris figured this out and

58
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,260
they figured out a really simple way of thinking about this.
