00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,730
Now let's look at a few examples of how time, frequency, and

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,600
frequency spectra are combined together.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,270
Let's imagine this is a signal I want to generate.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,530
This signal was generated by simply doing an addition of two different signals.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,410
This signal here, again, repeating.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,010
And the next one was this one.

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,470
Let's look at them mathematically.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,800
So this output target signal was basically a sine.

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,438
Twice of the frequency stuff here.

10
00:00:30,438 --> 00:00:35,470
And then one-third of the sine of twice what the frequency is

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,440
also much higher, three times.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,750
So in essence what you basically look at is this signal times one-third of

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,110
this signal is giving me this signal.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,560
How we plot this in the frequency domain?

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,510
So again, now we're looking at amplitude and the frequency.

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:59,060
The variables here are f1 is f itself, f2 is twice f, f3 is 3 times f.

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,990
Remember that's, this is what three times f is.

18
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:07,347
So first value, of course, is 1 amplitude entirely of f itself and

19
00:01:07,347 --> 00:01:10,640
then 3 times one-third signal.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,649
So this is, that's why this is 0.13.

21
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,765
And this was about 1.

22
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,410
So this is basically the frequency spectra of this signal looks like.
