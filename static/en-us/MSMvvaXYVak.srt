00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,400
Much of the process of coding
the main activity is setting it up to

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,450
use Location Services.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,010
You've done this several times already.

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,910
You may be familiar with the flow.

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,260
In OnCreate,
you set up your GoogleApiClient.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,960
In OnStart, you connect the
GoogleApiClient to Location Services.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,570
You implement the OnConnectionFailed and
OnConnectionSuspended callbacks.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,370
And you also implement
the onConnected callback,

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,320
in which you setup your LocationRequest.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,150
Once you've implemented
all these functions and

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,840
built it in the usual way,
check this box when you're done.
