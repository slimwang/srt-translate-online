1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,140
Now, we're going to use a simple
reduction to show that this language B,

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,770
consisting of the descriptions of
Turing machines that accept something

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,280
is undecidable.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,630
Our strategy is to reduce
the diagonal language to it.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,600
In other words,
we'll argue that deciding B

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,050
is at least as hard as deciding
the diagonal language.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,110
Since we can't decide the diagonal
language, we can't decide B either.

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,530
Here's one of many possible reductions.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,309
The reduction is a computable function
whose input is the description of

10
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:31,649
a Turing machine M.

11
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:37,760
And it's going to build another
machine N in this python-like syntax.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,940
First, we write down
the description of a Turing machine

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,320
by defining this nested function.

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,170
Then, we return that function.

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,580
An important point is
that the reduction,

16
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,690
R, never actually runs the machine N.

17
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,890
It just writes the program for it.

18
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,770
Note here, that in this example,

19
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,170
N totally ignores the actual
input given to it.

20
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,410
It just runs M on it's own description.

21
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,150
And does whatever that computation does.

22
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,710
Hence, and it's either going to be
a machine that accepts nothing,

23
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,240
if M doesn't accept its own description,
either by looping or rejecting.

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,060
Or if M does accept its own description,
then N is going to accept everything.

25
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,210
In the one case,
the language of N will be the empty set.

26
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,370
And in the other case,
it will be sigma star.

27
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,880
A decider for this language B, would
be able to tell the difference, and

28
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,740
therefore tell us whether M
accepted its own description.

29
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,190
Therefore, if B had a decider we would
be able to decide the diagonal language,

30
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,790
which is impossible.

31
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,520
So B cannot be decidable.
