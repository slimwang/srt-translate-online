1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,450
We need to add the logic for

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:05,100
the rock paper scissors game,
the logic that defines who wins.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,130
For this, we'll need if statements.

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,280
The general form for an if statement in
Objective-C looks something like this.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,660
It looks a lot like an if
statement in Swift,

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,860
except you always have to have
parentheses around the condition.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,470
And of course, the statements
are followed by semi-colons.

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,270
Let's add an if statement to the defeats
method you began defining earlier in

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,190
the RPSTurn class.

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,530
We need to return true every time
the move associated with self,

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,040
the object calling this method,
defeats the opponent's move.

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,910
The opponent is being passed in here.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,080
So we need to return true for
three cases.

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,250
If self.move is paper, and
opponent.move is rock, then return true.

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,320
Self defeats opponent.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,920
Here's the second case.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,630
If self.move is scissors and
opponent.move is paper then return true.

18
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,910
Self defeats opponent again.

19
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,050
You can see that the logical operators,
the equals operator, the and and

20
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,620
or operators,
are all the same as in Swift.

21
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,085
And finally if self.move is rock and

22
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:08,640
opponent.move is scissors,
return true as well.

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,080
For all other cases,
the opponent will defeat self so

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,080
the method should return false.

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,430
This method returns false if
the game is a tie, but that's okay.

26
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,220
We're going to handle ties
in a different method.
