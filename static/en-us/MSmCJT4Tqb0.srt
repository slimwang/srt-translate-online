00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,670
For the billing address
input I just set the for

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,630
attribute on the label to
the same ID that the input has.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,490
Easy enough, and then for

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,420
the telephone number I nested
the input inside the label.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,860
I actually like doing it
this way a little bit more,

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,690
because nesting it makes it more obvious
that the input belongs to the label.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,240
I still used a for attribute though, so

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,450
that my form would play
nice with screen readers.

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,170
And here's how it looks.

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,590
Doesn't look too different right now but

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,580
you'll notice that when
you click on the labels,

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,790
that their associated
inputs get put into focus.

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,910
Very nice.

14
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,590
Next stop, we'll be continuing our
interview with Luke Wroblewski.

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,130
Watch him as he describes how
he likes to design inputs.
