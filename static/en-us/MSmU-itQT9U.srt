1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is no.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Everything we've seen so far any attacker could have generated.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If our communication was actually be intercepted,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
an attacker could generate a certificate that says all of these things.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But instead of having Google's real public key,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
we have a public key generated by the attacker.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Just looking at this provides no value yet.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What we need is a signature.
