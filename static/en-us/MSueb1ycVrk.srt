1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,406
That was the algebraic approach to the solution and it works nicely.

2
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:07,540
In fact that was the math that you would actually encode if

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,980
you were writing a computer program to do this.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,330
But what it doesn't do is give you exactly the intuition of what's going on,

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,390
in photometric stereo.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,680
So to do that, let's take a look at this in p q space.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,440
So, let's suppose we have some light source, the first light source, p s one,

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,110
q s one, and so we'll say that, remember we know it's, it,

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,890
where it's located, and then if we measured it's intensity,

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,570
let's say it's 0.7, that some particular curve here.

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,520
So the other ones are dotted to remind you of them.

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,460
But the idea here is that the solution for

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,602
p and q, must lie somewhere on that curve.

14
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:49,170
All right, we don't know where yet, so what do we do?

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,280
Well, in the old shape up shading we did some funny sort of assumptions and

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,230
integration and stuff that just doesn't work.

17
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,940
Well, here all we do is we say let me put up another light source.

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,750
Here is a second light source, p q of 2 of s and

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,745
now it has to lie somewhere on this curve.

20
00:01:06,745 --> 00:01:07,700
'Kay?

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,010
And you'll notice those curves intersect in more than one place.

22
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,520
Well that's troubling it intersects more than one place.

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,260
What do we do to make it come to one place?

24
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,210
Well, we just put down a third light source, all right.

25
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,920
And if everything is calibrated and

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,180
working correctly, then the orientation of that point.

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,730
And the albedo are recovered at being exactly that location.

28
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,130
So, that's the geometric, sort of, description of photometric stereo.
