00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,080
So we're going to define what is context and tell you how

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,030
to get it just right. But first, we're going to hear from

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,860
a user that we visited back in lesson one and he's

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,500
going to tell us how he feels when we get context wrong.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,090
>> An app I really like is ESPN Scorecenter but what,

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,580
there's a feature about it that I really don't like. Well,

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,650
I do like, but not at all times. It, it will

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,570
send you updates of things that are happening in the sports

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,150
world. I don't care about everything that's happening in the sports

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,001
world. I don't want it to text me at 2 a.m

11
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:35,400
and wake me up to tell me that you know somebody

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,720
caught the world's biggest fish or whatever. That, that doesn't, I don't

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,710
care about it. So it seems like Clark experienced a UX fail.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,280
>> I know, it's really sad, but it could have

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,860
been avoided. Which one of these sensors would you use

16
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,000
to make sure that Clark doesn't get woken up in

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,840
the middle of the night with information he doesn't want?
