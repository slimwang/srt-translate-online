1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,240
Using what we found in Google Trends,

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,790
you can further explore keyword
options using Google Keyword Planner.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,490
Keyword Planner is an awesome tool
that's similar to Google Trends in some

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:15,870
ways, like identifying related keywords
and seeing historical statistics.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,160
But the biggest difference is we get to
narrow down options by their performance

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,680
and what we can afford.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,160
This will help us make
our plan more realistic.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,450
And we'll support our
decision about keywords and

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,880
budget when we build
our ad words campaign.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,330
Now the biggest takeaways for

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,890
keyword planner are first
expanding your keyword options.

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,350
Based on your first set of keywords from
Google Trends, you can get ideas to more

13
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,650
relevant keywords, and hopefully ones
you haven't actually thought of before.

14
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,380
Second, you can use it as a simulation.

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,850
For different bids, budgets and learn
what estimated number of clicks and

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,430
conversions you might get
from certain keywords.

17
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,130
This will help you choose
your bid on every keyword and

18
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,250
plan your budget accordingly for
you AdWords campaign.

19
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,650
However, if your keywords are really
popular among advertisers

20
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,230
it might be challenging and
expensive for you to bid on clicks.

21
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,790
We'll learn more in lesson four about
how your placement in a search results

22
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,320
list is a combination of your
performance and your bid.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,140
Now, as a beginner it's
usually pretty tricky for you.

24
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,550
It'll take you a while to perform
better than the existing players.

25
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,570
Especially if it's a crowded market,
like insurance, for example.

26
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,730
And obviously your advertising
budget is going to be a little bit

27
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,270
lower than those big name advertisers.

28
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,450
Make sure you're focusing on keywords
that are really specific for

29
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,760
your added value.

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,980
That way you'll perform better than your
competitors and have fewer competitors.

31
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,830
For us, for example we learned
that in Google Trends pet

32
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,950
care is a more popular search
term than pet sitting.

33
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,360
So we may want to go with that search
term and reach a bigger audience.

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,310
However the truth of the matter is,
then we would be competing with

35
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,790
veterinarian services, insurance for
pets and other advertisers.

36
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,730
Who have a much larger budget
than we do at Embarkment.

37
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,770
So rather than having us walk through
Google's Keyword Planner with you.

38
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,130
We highly encourage you to check
out Google's documentation,

39
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,639
it's really wonderful for
people of all skill sets.

40
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,200
So if you're an expert
at Keyword Planner or

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,030
just starting out, the documentation
is really easy and engaging.

42
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,910
There's a link to a video in the
instructor notes that talks more about

43
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,450
Keyword Planner as well as
a link to the documentation.

44
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,620
This documentation will
be endlessly helpful for

45
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,750
you when you're exploring keywords and
other Google tools.

46
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,900
It's great practice to get
comfortable exploring documentation

47
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,610
because technology is ever changing.
