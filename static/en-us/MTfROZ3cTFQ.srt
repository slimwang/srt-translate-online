1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:07,310
So this is just, in picture form,
the address space 0 to 4 GB.

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,017
This is the mode 3 GB we're talking
about, which is the user space,

3
00:00:12,017 --> 00:00:15,831
user core and data and
it can be accessed in user mode, or

4
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:19,347
the ring that corresponds
to user mode execution.

5
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:22,646
And the high 1 GB has to be kernel mode,
and

6
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:26,877
that's where the kernel data,
and kernel code goes.

7
00:00:26,877 --> 00:00:31,775
So, this is just the split that we're
talking about here showing, drawing

8
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:36,915
the address space starting at 0 going
to the max, which is to the 31 minus 1.
