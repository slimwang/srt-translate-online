00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,236
We know that at point p, these two equations should be satisfied by the same

2
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:10,313
values of x and y. So, can you figure out a way to combine them into a single

3
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:15,340
equation, where x is the only variable? We want to keep x as the variable

4
00:00:15,352 --> 00:00:18,529
because it's the value that we are looking for.
