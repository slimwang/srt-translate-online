1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,710
So, now let's calculate Tukey's HSD, and see if any of the sample means for the

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,440
amount of food cows ate is honestly significantly different. Use the

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:15,510
Studentized range statistic table to find the critical value of Q. You'll need

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,247
to know the number of groups we're comparing. As well as the degrees of freedom

5
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:24,596
for the within-group variability. You'll notice that you can calculate Tukey's

6
00:00:24,596 --> 00:00:31,629
HSD for alpha equals 0.01 and 0.05. Calculate this for alpha equals 0.05.
