1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,980
If you type a command and you don't
get it right, or if you just want to

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,510
recall something that you've used
before, try using the up arrow key.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,640
The shell keeps a history of
commands that you've run so

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,340
you can walk back through
them using the arrow keys.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,460
Then you can edit a previous
command line that you've used and

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,160
maybe get some more success.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,140
There are a couple of other ways
to access the shell history.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,680
One of them you've seen
is the command history,

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,480
which prints out the whole history.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,740
This doesn't just include history
from the current shell session,

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,350
you can also see commands
you ran in the past.

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,300
Another one is the keystroke control R.

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,475
This is a special function,

14
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:42,615
called reverse i search, which lets
you search your shell history.

15
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:47,175
This is awfully handy if you used some
command long ago or just yesterday and

16
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:50,495
it's long command and
you want to recall it now.

17
00:00:50,495 --> 00:00:52,325
Oh, that was that command we ran.

18
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:52,825
Great.
