Hi there, I'm Matt Lennard.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,870
I'll be your instructor for
this course on data visualization.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,119
Where you'll be learning how to create
graphics for exploring data and

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,440
sharing your results.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,745
When we're talking about
data visualization,

6
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,507
we mean the visual display
of quantitative information.

7
00:00:14,507 --> 00:00:17,880
It's the name of this book,
Edward Tufte's seminal work.

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,291
This thing is beautiful and
it's essential for

9
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,985
anyone interested in database.

10
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:27,473
If this isn't enough an endorsement,
maybe President Obama can convince you.

11
00:00:27,473 --> 00:00:30,130
Use visualizations to tell a story.

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,970
Here's a graph showing the number of
times have been attacked from my evil

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,500
kitten Chihiro.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,410
I've made a data points pictures of my
face indicating how much pain I was in.

15
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,650
What's the story here?

16
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,670
Tuesday was a rough day for me.

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,030
Wednesday was pretty great, and Chihero
is a tiny tiger occupying my home.

18
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,100
In this course, you'll learn how to
design and create visualizations.

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,020
First, I'll cover fundamentals and
design principles.

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,720
Then, you'll learn how to
actually make visualizations.

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,240
Let's get started.
