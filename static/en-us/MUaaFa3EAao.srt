00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,610
XOR is a basic operation in cartography.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:09,820
For example, in a DES round,
the right half of the input is extended

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:14,450
to 8-bit and
then XOR with the parent key.

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,740
So let's do a quiz to
review the XOR operations.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,630
Here the key is FA F2 in hacks,
and the plain text is Hi.
