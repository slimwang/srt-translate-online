00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,054
That may be Robbie. I'm looking for the first yellow, followed by blue, and

2
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:11,550
swap them. That would be bby, byy. And again, the first yellow followed by

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,080
blue, and swap them, and I'm at [BLANK_AUDIO] yyy and I'm done. Now, the

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,300
sequence is in order, all the blue ones come before all the yellow ones. So,

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,940
Robbie has used this algorithm here to clean up the Legos. Now, this is a great

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:31,495
example, again, of an algorithm. You have a sequence of steps, each of them is

7
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:36,645
unambiguous, each of them is something that Robbie can do. And eventually, the

8
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:41,240
Legos are all cleaned up. It's actually not totally obvious why the Legos are

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,250
always cleaned up when you execute the sequence of steps, but they are. Now,

10
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,400
you've seen algorithms and pseudo code first with numbers, then with Lego

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,090
blocks. And now, you get to practice the Lego blocks a little bit more with

12
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,365
Sarah. Have fun.
