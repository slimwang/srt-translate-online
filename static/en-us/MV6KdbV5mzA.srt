00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,232
The sum is just 8 plus 2i. We need to recognize here what things you can add

2
00:00:05,232 --> 00:00:10,382
together and what things we can't. 3 and 5 are both the real parts of these

3
00:00:10,382 --> 00:00:15,907
nubers so they can combine and 4i and negative 2i are the two imaginary parts so

4
00:00:15,907 --> 00:00:18,144
they can combine to give us 2i.
