1
00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:02,950
David, what do you think
the patient would select next?

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,070
>> So unlike last time,

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,850
the first production rule won't fire
because I do perceive a runner on first.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,990
Instead, while I don't
perceive fewer than two outs,

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,070
I do perceive a runner on first.

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,110
So this production rule will fire, and

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,120
now by goal is to get
the batter out via pitching.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,010
That'll skip the next rule and
come down to here.

9
00:00:23,072 --> 00:00:25,830
Given that the goal is to pitch and
we have a new batter,

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,610
we're going to add some
information to our stake.

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,740
So we can actually now, not just keep
track of the game as a whole, but

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,900
we can keep track of this individual
exchange with the batter.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,170
Then the goal is to pitch and
the batter is not yet out, so

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,640
we're going to suggest
the throw-curve-ball-operator.

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,360
We then look and
see that the batter bats right handed so

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,320
the next rule doesn't fire.

17
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,210
So at this point, we've only suggest one
operator, the throw-curve-ball-operator.

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,120
So we're going to send
that to our motor system.

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,940
So the answer will be that
we'll throw a curve ball.

20
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,810
>> That was right, David, thank you.

21
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,800
Let's summarize some of
the things that David noted.

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,040
So, based on the contents of the working
memory, some rules get activated.

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,790
As these rules get activated,
some consequence get established.

24
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,830
As this consequence get established,
they get written.

25
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,880
Those consequence get written
on the working memory.

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,080
So the contents of working
memory are constantly changing.

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,940
As the contents of the working memory
change, nodules can get activated.

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,070
So there is a constant interaction
between the working memory and

29
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,630
the long term memory.

30
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,270
The contents of the working
memory change quite rapidly.

31
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,910
The contents of the long term
memory change very, very slowly.
