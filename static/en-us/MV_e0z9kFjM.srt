There was so much you might have said here. And, if

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,730
you have any ideas that I don't mention, please share them in

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,120
the forum. To start, our data's from 2008. So, not only do

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,110
we need to account for inflation, but the diamond market is quite

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,590
different now than it was. In fact, when I fit models

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,650
to this data and predicted the price of the diamonds that I

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,430
found off a market, I kept getting predictions that were way too

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,460
low. After some additional digging, I found that global diamonds were poor.

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,550
It turns out that prices plummeted in 2008 due

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,610
to the global financial crisis. And since then prices, at

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,285
least for wholesale polished diamonds, have grown at about

12
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:39,430
6% per year, compound annual rate. The rapidly growing number

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,190
of couples in China buying diamond engagement rings might

14
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,280
also explain this increase. You can click on the links

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,300
in the instructor notes to learn more about that.

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,620
And finally, after looking at the data on price scope,

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,410
I realize that diamond prices grew

18
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,480
unevenly across different karat sizes since 2008,

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,550
meaning that the model I initially

20
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,500
estimated couldn't simply be adjusted by inflation.
