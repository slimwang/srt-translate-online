1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,580
So just to recall where we're at, we started out taking a look at

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,790
histograms of inter-tweet times in order to get a feel for the data.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,980
We observed that it seemed to follow an exponential distribution.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,270
Now as we recall the form of an exponential distribution is

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,720
the following expression.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,060
And so we did a maximum likelihood estimation fit for

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,970
this distribution to the observed data.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,260
But the problem is,

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,780
how sure are we that the beta value we fit is the correct value?

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,599
And as we discovered, that confidence depends on the amount of data we have.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,230
And we found that we could quantify that uncertainty via Chebyshev's inequality.

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,210
Which simply says that the absolute value of the deviation of our

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,050
estimate of beta from the actual value of beta, that the probability of

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,970
that being greater than epsilon is one over four n epsilon squared.

15
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,330
But there's actually a tighter bound on this confidence interval

16
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,530
via something called Hoeffding's inequality.

17
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,239
So Hoeffding's inequality is saying exactly the same sort of

18
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,320
statement about our estimate of the true beta parameter.

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,390
It's just talking about the probability that our deviation from the true data

20
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,430
parameter is greater than epsilon, but the bound on it is a little bit better.

21
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,290
Instead of one over four n epsilon squared,

22
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,880
it uses two times e to the power of two n epsilon squared.

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,740
A link to more about Hoeffding's Inequality is in the instructor's notes.

24
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,280
But again, as you can see,

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,330
the inequality depends on the amount of data that we've collected
