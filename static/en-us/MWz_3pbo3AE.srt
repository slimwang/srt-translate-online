1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,457
So this is actually an interesting idea
because that can allow us to start

2
00:00:04,457 --> 00:00:05,826
creating a light field or

3
00:00:05,826 --> 00:00:10,077
a plenoptic camera, something which
was introduced by Ng et al in 2005.

4
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:12,951
I have a subject, I have a main lens.

5
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:16,407
And what I can do now
is add a linticular or

6
00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:19,676
a microlens array before the sensor.

7
00:00:19,676 --> 00:00:23,461
And what that could do now is anytime it
goes through, it basically can also do

8
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:26,567
more analysis to figure out more
information about the light.

9
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:32,130
Just pretty much light what we saw,
by putting it in a series of pinholes.

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,960
So what does a lenticular or
microlens array do?

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,040
Here's a simple example.

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,770
This is a lenticular array.

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:44,260
By just placing these types of small
lenslets like this in front of a screen,

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,110
We can actually start seeing depth.

15
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:52,610
So, lenticular array is basically
putting in different lenses

16
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,750
that basically can be seen, in this
case, by the left eye or the right eye.

17
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,700
And basically,
allows you to generate a newer image

18
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,530
that will start encoding depth and being
able to see depth in images like this.

19
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,460
I mean, lenticular arrays are one
of the more popular arrays,

20
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,200
you may have seen them.

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,300
Also, we're showing 2D or
3D images in a 2D plane.

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,170
Or sometimes they could also be just
cylindrical lenses that could be used to

23
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,910
form lenticular arrays.

24
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,298
Again I encourage you to
look up this kind of stuff.

25
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:21,834
You may have seen a whole lot of
these types of things already.

26
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:25,872
But just in essence of this kind of
stuff, we can actually putting something

27
00:01:25,872 --> 00:01:29,784
like this in front of it cylindical,
cylindrical lenses like this,

28
00:01:29,784 --> 00:01:33,720
before a sensor, we can start actually
now capturing more information.

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,585
So now let me connect it to something
we have also looked at already.

30
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:40,910
Remember the UV and the ST planes?

31
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,551
UV was where the lens would be put,
the camera plane, and

32
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:45,159
the ST is where the image plane is.

33
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:51,626
And here, basically what I do, is I put
in a bunch of smaller micro-lens arrays.

34
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:56,014
And according to what we did previously,
that is, put in small pinholes.

35
00:01:56,014 --> 00:02:01,080
If I put in this kind of stuff,
now I can actually create a light field.

36
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,083
Because what we have done now is use
this way to create an array of cameras,

37
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,196
and each camera is capturing
different types of things.

38
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:13,146
Once I have this kind of stuff, what I
can now do is traverse from u and v and

39
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:17,447
s and t To start creating not just
one image that was captured but

40
00:02:17,447 --> 00:02:18,686
a seas of images.

41
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:21,360
And, of course,
interpolating between those,

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,382
I can actually start getting more
information than just one single image.

43
00:02:25,382 --> 00:02:28,736
In essence,
I would've captured a light field and

44
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,020
generated pixels whenever
I want to add to the fact
