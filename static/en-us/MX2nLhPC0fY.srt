[Dave] So question 8 also tests how well you understand the find method

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
as well as using variables.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The question is assume that text is a variable that holds any string value.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Your goal is to write Python code that prints out the position

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
of the second occurrence of the string "zip" in text

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
or prints out -1 if the string "zip" does not occur at least twice in text.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So there are 2 examples.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If text is "zip files are zipped,"

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
the output should be 14, which is where the second zip appears.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If the text value is "zip files are compressed,"

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the output should be -1 since zip only appears once.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And this is a pretty tough question,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
so I'm going to give this one a single gold star.
