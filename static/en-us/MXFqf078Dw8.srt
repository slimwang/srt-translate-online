1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So here's one way to solve the question:

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
we're going to define a procedure,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
so we'll define a procedure, is_friend.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It takes a single string as input.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We'll call that the name--that's the name of the person.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're going to do a test using an "if" statement.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We'll test if the first character of name is equal to an upper case "D".

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,400
If it is, that means the person's a friend,

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,000
so we can return True.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If it's not--they're not a friend--

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
we don't need the "else", right--we could just have our return False.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,354
I'm going to keep things more symmetric by using an "else"

13
00:00:30,354 --> 00:00:35,000
and if the name does not start with a "D", we can return False.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So let's try that.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
With our example, ('Diane'), we get is_friend is True,

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and when we try with ('Fred'), we get the output, False.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So this looks like what we want.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is actually a lot more code than we need.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There's no reason we have to actually have the "if" expression.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Since the test itself evaluates to a Boolean

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we could just return right away.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We could return the result of the comparison.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We're doing the equality test,

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
if name, index zero--the first character of name--is equal to "D".

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So this has the same meaning, much simpler thing.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,200
Sometimes people think it's unnatural to write expressions like this,

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,000
that when you have test conditions,

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
you feel like you need an "if" statement--but it's not required.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's much simpler, in this case, to just have the one line

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
where we return the result of the equality test, directly.
