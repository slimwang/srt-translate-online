Here's our factored answer. Great work if you got that one correct. To divide a

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,405
rational expression, we multiply by the recripricol. So, we change division to

3
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:14,140
multiplication and flip the second fraction over. We can use factoring patterns

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,039
to find the factors of this numerator and. And denominator. This is a difference

5
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:22,852
of squares. So we have x plus 3 times x minus 3. Our denominator, however, is a

6
00:00:22,852 --> 00:00:27,842
perfect square trinomial. So we'll have x minus 3 times x minus 3. We find

7
00:00:27,842 --> 00:00:33,393
factors of negative 6 that sum to negative 5. Those factors are negative 6 and

8
00:00:33,393 --> 00:00:38,496
positive 1. We use factoring by grouping to get 2x plus 1 times x minus 3. For

9
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:43,714
our denominator, we want to find factors of negative 36. That sum to negative 5.

10
00:00:43,714 --> 00:00:49,524
Those factors are negative 9 and positive 4. After factoring, we get 3x plus 2,

11
00:00:49,524 --> 00:00:54,068
times, 2x minus 3. Now we're ready to simplify our factors. This x minus 3

12
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:59,052
divided by x minus 3 equals 1. And look at that, there's another x minus 3,

13
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:04,680
divided by x minus Is 3. Those will also equal 1. And our remaining factors are

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,320
x plus 3 and 2x plus 1 for the numerator, and 3x plus 2 times 2x minus 3 in our

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,473
denominator.
