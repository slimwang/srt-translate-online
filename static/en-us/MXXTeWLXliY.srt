1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,580
And the answer is the absolute value of x, and I can prove it to you.

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:10,740
If you were to show the absolute value of x, then it can't be anything negative.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,920
And all the points here get moved from the negative side to the positive side.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,280
So, this point in particular over here becomes this point here.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,110
Gone are these.

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,640
This point over here becomes this point over here.

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,460
So this is how it looks like if you look near all the points to the absolute

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,200
value of X coordinate system.

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,630
You just flip them over.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,390
And if you look at this diagram,

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,630
what you find is that there is now a beautiful, perfect linear separation.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,602
And if you ask yourself, how did the linear separation look in

13
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:50,528
the original space of x and y is effectively something like that.

14
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:54,516
It is non-linear because it has this inflection point over here.

15
00:00:54,516 --> 00:00:57,500
That's non-trivial to see, but

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,010
as you look at this, I hope you get that adding this one new non-linear feature

17
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,950
makes support vector machine linear separate the Xs from the circles.
