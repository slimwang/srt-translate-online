Here's an outline of my answer and
again I'll build it up piece by piece.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,180
The first part is similar to what
we did for duplicating a string.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,090
We first write a blank
to the second tape.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,040
Then we copy the first part
of our input string to it.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,600
The x part.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,280
And then we rewind the second tape.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,870
We can illustrate this idea like this.

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,660
We started by copying x
from Tape 1 to Tape 2.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,270
And positioned the head on
Tape 1 at the start of y,

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,640
that is the text we want to search in.

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,240
And then we rewound the head on Tape 2,
so that it's positioned at the beginning

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,120
of the key string, the thing we're
going to look for within the text y.

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,730
At this point we move to state q3.

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,490
In here we walk forward on both
tapes as long as we have a match.

15
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,220
If we reach the blank
cell at the end of x,

16
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,950
then we've found a matching
substring and we accept.

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,755
If we reach a blank on the first tape,
then we reject,

18
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:04,250
since that means that x is longer than
the remaining portion of y, the search.

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,150
And if we find a mismatch
between these two at any point,

20
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,970
then we rewind one step on Tape 2,

21
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,480
and then we rewind both tapes until
we get back to the beginning of x.

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,780
And then we can repeat
this time will be checking

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,110
x against a substring of y
that's one further space down.
