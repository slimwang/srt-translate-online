1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Beto mentioned that we should provide 
bitmaps at different resolutions.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,700
In our app, the 48dp icon on the Nexus S
looks to be about the same size

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,760
as on the Nexus 4, and on the Nexus 5.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,420
However, in reality, this asset
that's being displayed,

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,810
is actually a lot bigger 
in terms of pixels

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,090
compared to this one.

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,000
To confirm, we can check out
the app resource folders.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,930
In the drawable folders, we see that
our app has a 48 x 48 pixel launcher icon

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,598
for mdpi devices located
in the drawable mdpi folder.

10
00:00:28,598 --> 00:00:31,900
To make an equivalent icon,
for the higher density devices,

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,420
we need to make that icon 
progressively larger.

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,900
To know exactly how big 
to make these images

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,680
and what the dp pixel
conversion should be,

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,430
we use an mdpi device as the baseline.

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,223
This is where one dp equals one pixel.

16
00:00:45,223 --> 00:00:49,633
Then on the HDPI device,
one dp equals 1.5 pixels.

17
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:53,530
And then it increases from there, 
all the way to an XXHDPI device,

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,810
where one dp equals four pixels.

19
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,211
For more info on the conversions, 
see the link below.

20
00:00:58,211 --> 00:01:01,181
Following those rules, these are
the sizes of the launcher icon

21
00:01:01,181 --> 00:01:02,779
in our drawable folders.

22
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:06,670
The MDPI one is 48 pixels x 48 pixels.

23
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,000
The one for HDPI is
1.5 times the size of this one.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,510
For an XHDPI device, the icon 
is two times the size of the MDPI one,

25
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,340
And for an XXHDPI device, the icon
is three times the size of this one.
