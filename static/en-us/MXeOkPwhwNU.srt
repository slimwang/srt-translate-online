00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:06,239
Let's say you spent 12 hours awake today. That means out of 24 hours, you spent

2
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:11,891
12 hours asleep. And let's say you spent 24 awake. That means you spent 0 hours

3
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:16,160
asleep. if we graph this for everyone, all of you will fall somewhere along

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,840
this line. We're assuming that you can't be half-awake or half-asleep. And in

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,365
that case, r is negative one. But normally, we deal with data that is not

6
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:31,625
perfectly correlated. And we can't calculate it in our heads. Instead, we'll

7
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:35,700
use software, and we can do it with Google Spreadsheets. Yay!
