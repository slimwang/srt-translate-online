00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,070
So let's say you're running
a web app on your own site and

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,520
some of your users are complaining
that they can't get to it anymore.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,170
You want to figure out whether their
access is being blocked by a firewall or

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,150
a filter or
something between them and you.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,970
Which of the following options do
you think might be useful to check?

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,109
First, can the user ping
your site by IP address?

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,880
Second, can the user access
a different domain on the same server?

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,090
Third, are you able to send them
email from your Gmail account?

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,360
Fourth, can they look up your
server's host name using DNS,

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,730
using a tool like host or dig?

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,690
And fifth,

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,830
are all of the users that report
the problem located in the same country?
