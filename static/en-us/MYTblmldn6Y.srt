1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,412
So the first thread is thread Id 0 in CUDA.

2
00:00:03,412 --> 00:00:10,880
Inside the if statement, you want to check if my thread Id is 0 which is comparing thread Idx.x to 0.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,890
In this case, only thread 0 will launch that kernel, and it will only get 1 kernel launch

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,890
no matter how many threads I've launched in my block.
