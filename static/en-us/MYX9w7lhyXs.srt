00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,856
As one final explanation for this lesson, let's see if there's a different

2
00:00:03,856 --> 00:00:07,751
inequality we can look at that can give us this same solution set. I'm just

3
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:12,041
quickly going to rewrite the original inequality that we have, and see if I can

4
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:16,248
modify it to simplify it a little bit. One thing I'd like you to notice, is that

5
00:00:16,248 --> 00:00:20,409
this negative sign outside of the entire expression, is going to effectively

6
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:24,697
multiply either both terms in the numerator by negative 1 or multiply the entire

7
00:00:24,697 --> 00:00:28,897
denominator by negative 1. So, we can consider this a common factor of, for

8
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:33,561
example, both terms in the numerator. There's one more common factor within one

9
00:00:33,561 --> 00:00:37,957
of the quantities here, and that's 2, in the quantity 2x minus 4. Both 2x and

10
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:42,657
negative 4 are divisible by 2. Let's rewrite this. Because multiplication is

11
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:47,577
commutative, I can move these factors around however I want. And I think what

12
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:52,680
I'd like to do is to write this factor of negative 1 half, as a single constant

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,848
outside of the rest of the terms multiplying that fraction. Now, we can very

14
00:00:57,848 --> 00:01:03,141
clearly see that there's this factor out here, this constant factor, that we can

15
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:08,072
just divide both sides by to get rid of. However, since we will be dividing by a

16
00:01:08,072 --> 00:01:12,762
fraction, we can equivalently just multiply it by its reciprocal or multiply by

17
00:01:12,762 --> 00:01:17,261
negative 2, on both sides, of course. Now, here's the kicker. Remember, that

18
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:21,613
since we're multiplying by a negative number on both sides, we need to switch

19
00:01:21,613 --> 00:01:26,360
the direction of the inequality. So now, we have this new inequality, x plus 10

20
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,954
over the quantity x plus 2 times the quantity x minus 2 is less than 0. And in

21
00:01:30,954 --> 00:01:35,754
fact, if you went through the entire process of solving for x here, you'd find

22
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:40,554
that the solution set for this inequality is exactly the same as the solution

23
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:45,099
set for this inequality up here. And we can tell why that's the case. These are

24
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:48,951
equivalent. We move from this one to this one using completely legal algebraic

25
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:52,846
modifications. Let's see how graphs can help us understand this inequality a

26
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:53,818
little bit better.
