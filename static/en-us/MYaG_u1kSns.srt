1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,102
IP lookups find longest prefixes. Let's suppose that we

2
00:00:04,102 --> 00:00:07,222
want to represent a particular IP address as one

3
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:11,902
point in the space from zero to 2 to the 32 minus 1, or the range of all

4
00:00:11,902 --> 00:00:16,880
32-byte IP addresses. Each prefix represents a smaller range

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,460
inside this larger range of 32-bit numbers. Obviously, this

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,850
is not to scale. Now these ranges, of course,

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,520
might be overlapping, as is shown here. And the idea

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,730
is that longest prefix match will match the

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,880
smallest prefix for which the IP address range

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,170
overlaps that of the specified IP address. So

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,630
longest prefix match is harder to perform than exact

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,660
match. For one, the destination IP address does

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,220
not indicate the length of the longest matching

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,530
prefix, so some algorithm needs to determine the

15
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,540
length of the longest matching prefix, which in this

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,050
case is 21. So we somehow need a way to search the

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,520
space of all prefix lengths, as well as prefixes of a given length.
