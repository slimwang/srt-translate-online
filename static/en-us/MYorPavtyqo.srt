1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
And of course, once you've gone through the proof,

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,720
this was a rather easy quiz just for relaxation

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,930
after all of these Boolean formulas and satisfiabilities.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,060
So of course, this formula has polynomial size,

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,300
because when you constructed it,

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,690
we took care of that.

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,230
It can encode any algorithm.

8
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,370
We did not make any special assumptions or restrictions on this algorithm here.

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,040
It can also encode any input, because that basically just means

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,110
whatever we're given, we encode it into memory and we know we can do that,

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,350
and finally, of course, that was the purpose of the construction,

12
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,600
this Boolean formula up here is only satisfiable

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,310
if solving this problem for this input returns a yes;

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,840
otherwise, if it's a no, you can not satisfy this formula.

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,570
And this of course is the whole purpose of the construction,

16
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,090
because what we have now shown is

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,600
that solving SAT on this Boolean formula

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,990
is the same as solving this problem

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,960
for this input here,

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,390
and what that means, of course also is

21
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,130
if you can solve SAT on this Boolean formula here

22
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,280
in polynomial time,

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,460
then you have a polynomial time simulation of this algorithm here

24
00:01:11,460 --> 99:59:59,999
running on this input.
