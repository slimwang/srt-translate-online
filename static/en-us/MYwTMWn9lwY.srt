1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,790
F of 2 equals eight, g of 2 equals 3, and f plus g of 2 equals 11. Nice

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,738
thinking if you got all 3 correct. To find the f of 2, we'll start by plugging

3
00:00:11,738 --> 00:00:17,232
the value of 2 in for X. So we'll have 3 times 2, which equals 6 plus 2, which

4
00:00:17,232 --> 00:00:22,760
equals 8. So when the input of the function x equals 2, the output of the

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:29,488
function is 8. For g of 2 we'll use a similar approach. We'll plug in the value

6
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:35,267
of 2 in for x, so we'll have g of two equals 2 squared minus 1. 2 squared

7
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:41,713
equals 4, minus 1 is 3. So, we know that g of 2 is 3. And for this last one it

8
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:45,532
just means we want to take the value of f of 2 and add it to the value of g of

9
00:00:45,532 --> 00:00:51,364
2. We're wondering what's the sum of the outputs, when both functions are

10
00:00:51,364 --> 00:00:56,660
evaluated at x equals 2? Well, we know f of 2 equals 8 and we know g of 2

11
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:03,009
equals 3. So we're really just adding these two outputs together to get 11, and

12
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:09,030
we can also see this on a graph. Here I've graphed f of x and g of x in Desmos.

13
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,339
F of x is this straight orange line and g of x is this curved parabola. Notice

14
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:21,028
that the f of 2, or the output for the orange function when x equals 2. Is

15
00:01:21,028 --> 00:01:26,667
positive 8 right here. If I zoom out, you can see that more clearly. And notice

16
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:34,348
that the output for g of x, when x equals 2, is positive 3 here. So, we're just

17
00:01:34,348 --> 00:01:40,052
going to add the output here of 8 to the output here of 3. When we add the two

18
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:44,043
outputs together, we'll get 11.
