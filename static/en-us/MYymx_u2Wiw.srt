1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,830
All right, you're done.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,690
Let's take a look at the solution.

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,390
While we cannot insert
a vector directly,

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,180
we can easily convert
a vector to an array.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,520
Once we've done this, the bulk insert
method will insert very efficiently.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,300
As you can see, we've uncommented
out this next series of lines.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,250
This allows us to test
our output to make sure

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,749
that we've actually inserted
the right thing into the database.

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,550
Let's actually run our app.

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,990
And as you can see, we're actually
reading the data out of the database

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,536
that we just inserted all correctly.

12
00:00:32,536 --> 00:00:36,750
Now our back end will update
efficiently, but we really need to be

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,100
querying things before requesting
them from the internet.

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,210
After all, the main point is to
have a responsive application.

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,770
We're still not even updating
the screen until we've

16
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,650
pulled data down from the web.

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,170
We also want to avoid doing
our query on the UI thread,

18
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,250
because doing operations like queries on
the UI thread cause Android to not be

19
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,470
able to draw frames fast enough,
which introduces frame rate jitter.

20
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,460
Fortunately, Android offers
a pattern for that known as Loaders.
