00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,780
I'm here with Mark Nguyen.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,440
He's a Course Manager here at Udacity.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,810
So, Mark, why should a student
post to the Udacity forums?

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,910
>> That's a very excellent question.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,430
Why should you not-
>> [LAUGH]

6
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,355
>> Want to post to the forums.

7
00:00:14,355 --> 00:00:17,340
There's a couple of things of
why should you use the forums.

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,508
Number one is the forums are there, they
most likely have your answer already.

9
00:00:21,508 --> 00:00:26,380
So if you're working on a project,
you're working through the course, and

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,430
if you find out that you
have a question, and

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:35,780
if you're stuck on something, most
likely there is already an answer there.

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,740
Most likely, a fellow student
has already asked that question.

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,270
And then you could just simply go
to the forum, search for it, and

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,470
then find your answer there.

15
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,660
The second thing of why you should use
the forum is to also practice your

16
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,660
communication skills on the forum,
and specifically,

17
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,120
how you should communicate
your problem and

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,850
how you should also conduct
yourself on the forum.

19
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,010
Because we've noticed that
the questions that are being posted,

20
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,560
the ones that get answered
frequently and the fastest,

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,750
are the ones that give everyone else the
entire context, the entire information.

22
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:22,460
So, when you're posting on the forums,
I really would highly recommend you to

23
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,470
really start thinking about how you
should phrase and frame your question.

24
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,650
And how you should give everyone
the entire context of your situation.

25
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,610
Here's my problem, here's what
I'm doing, here's what I've done.

26
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,420
Here's some snippets of my code,
if you have any code,

27
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,420
if you are working on a that has
coda in it, but basically give

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,120
everyone the entire context and
let everyone know what you know.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,250
So, that could help you prevent
a lot of back and forth stuff and

30
00:01:54,250 --> 00:02:01,060
help you go ahead and communicate in
a very succinct and efficient manner.

31
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,610
The forums really give
you a good area for

32
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,620
you to practice these
communication skills.

33
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,220
Third, and one I wanted to let you know
about is go ahead and help other people.

34
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,910
And if you teach the subject yourself,

35
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,890
you will actually have a deeper
knowledge of the material yourself.

36
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,950
So in addition to helping people,

37
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,900
in addition to communicating and
finding answers,

38
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,950
the forums serve as a rich resource for
you to network and help other people.

39
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,440
And then this will really help you gain,

40
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,805
understand the knowledge
on a deeper level.

41
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:34,790
>> Mm-hm.

42
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,149
>> And as well as build your
reputation on the forums.

43
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:43,690
Which goes to my fourth reason why you
should use forums is about networking.

44
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,170
It's all about networking.

45
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,670
We have a huge array of people
from all across the world,

46
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,620
from all walks of life and
they're all in it together,

47
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,000
and you somehow manage to build
a great reputation for yourself.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,850
Guess what?

49
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,242
There will people who want to help you
out later on down the road, as well.

50
00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:06,420
So, I highly recommend you to
really use the forums as your

51
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,770
tool to look up the information you
need, and also to help other people out.

52
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,750
>> Wow, thank you so much.

53
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,260
>> You're welcome.
