1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,980
So when you're done your
unconnected should look like this.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,580
I've removed the old code where
as using the Plus.PeopleApi and

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,980
I've replaced it with new code where
I'm using Plus.AccountApi instead.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,830
As you can see I'm calling the get
account name and I'm passing and

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,260
it the Api clients.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,870
I'm then setting the text
on my status label

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,060
to be this email address that I got
back when I called getAccountName.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,260
It just returned a string email
address and I'm setting that here.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,920
So I say signed into My App as
whatever the emailAddress is.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,030
When I'm in email scope I don't
have access to my full name or

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,270
other meta data like that,
I just have access to the email address,

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,330
as the name of the scope would suggest.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,349
So lets run this application and
see what it looks like.

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,420
So now we can see
the application running.

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,520
So if I click the Sign In button,

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,840
first I'm going to get
the permissions dialogue, and

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,450
once I do that I'm now going to hit
my breakpoint because I've signed in.

18
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,800
So if I step over the breakpoint here,
and I look in my debugger window,

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,428
we can now see that my email address
has been set, and I was signed in as

20
00:00:59,428 --> 00:01:05,489
lmoroney@gmail.com and the email
address string now contains that.

21
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,340
So if I then just set text
on that to the status and

22
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,930
I'll continue running the application.

23
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,880
If I switch back to the emulator

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,870
you'll now see I'm signed into
my app as almoroney@gmail.com.

25
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,410
And you'll also see that I've set
the button to be disabled, so

26
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,040
I'm using the disabled state
on the button and that's it.

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,210
It's as simple as that in
order to get email access and

28
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,760
your users may prefer this instead
of giving access to their profile.

29
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,020
And if all you need to do is a simple
thing where you're tracking users

30
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,900
that are signed in, and
their email address is unique enough,

31
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,190
this might be a better way, and
a much more user-friendly way.
