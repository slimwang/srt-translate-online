1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,365
For the first solution, we'll have negative 18 plus 24i. And for the second

2
00:00:05,365 --> 00:00:11,260
solution, we'll have 28 plus 16i. Nice work, if you got those two correct. We

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:17,506
start by distributing the 6i to 4 and 3i. Next, we multiply to get 24i, and 18i

4
00:00:17,506 --> 00:00:24,546
squared. We replace i squared with its value of negative 1. So, essentially 18i

5
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:29,314
squared becomes negative 18. Now we just flip the order of the real part and

6
00:00:29,314 --> 00:00:34,724
the imaginary part to get negative 18 plus 24i. In the second problem, we

7
00:00:34,724 --> 00:00:39,674
distribute positive 6 to 2 and to 4i. In the second distribution, we want to be

8
00:00:39,674 --> 00:00:45,300
careful. We have negative 4i times 2 here, and negative 4i times positive 4i

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,370
here. We perform multiplication on each of our four terms to get 12 plus 24i

10
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:57,571
minus 8i minus 16i squared. We combine our like terms of positive 24i and

11
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:04,991
negative 8i to get positive 16i. Next, we want to replace this i squared with a

12
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:10,965
value of negative 1. So negative 16i squared becomes positive 16. Remember,

13
00:01:10,965 --> 00:01:14,320
whenever we have an i squared term, the sign just changes, and we no longer

14
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,181
have the variable of i squared. This was also true over here. We had positive

15
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:24,372
18i squared, which turned into negative 18. Finally, we add our like terms of

16
00:01:24,372 --> 00:01:29,772
12 and 16 to get 28 plus 16i, the final result. Nice work if you got at least

17
00:01:29,772 --> 00:01:31,323
one of those correct.
