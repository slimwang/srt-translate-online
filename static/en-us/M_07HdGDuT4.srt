1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,045
So this is going to be a key concept for being able to develop and answer

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:05,689
two questions like that and it's the notion

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,340
of epsilon exhaustion. Which sounds kind of tiring.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,250
>> I know I'm epsilon exhausted right now.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,252
>> Yea, me too. So what we mean by

6
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:17,250
this is, well here's the definition. So, a version space.

7
00:00:18,856 --> 00:00:22,470
Of, version space that is derived from a particular sample,

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,530
it's considered epsilon exhausted if and only if for all

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,030
the hypotheses that are in that version space they have low error. So

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,040
if we can do this then your algorithm going to work. Your algorithm

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,500
says at that point choose any of the hypotheses in your hypothesis set.

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,400
You are going to be fine, you are going to have low error.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,088
>> Sure.

14
00:00:41,088 --> 00:00:43,580
>> If you don't do this, your algorithm is

15
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,880
going to be in trouble because you are uniformly at

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,040
random choose one of the hypothesis and it has a

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,530
chance of being wrong. It could be a fairly high

18
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,670
chance if there is, say there is only two hypothesis

19
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,170
left in the version space, one has high error and one

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,460
has low error. We really have to make sure that

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,749
the only things left in the version space have low error

22
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:03,950
>> Okay, that makes sense, that makes sense.

23
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,400
>> Alright, so we're going to have to develop a little bit of

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,680
theory to figure out when that occurs but this is a really key concept.

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,220
>> Okay, so, I guess if was trying to put this

26
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,800
into English just to make certain I understand it, what you're saying

27
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,190
is, something is epsilon exhausted, a version

28
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,660
space is epsilon exhausted exactly in the

29
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,910
case when everything that you might possibly

30
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,880
choose has an error less than epsilon.

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,910
>> Sure.

32
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,800
>> Period. And so if there's anything in there that

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,670
has error greater than epsilon, then it's not epsilon exhausted.

34
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,790
>> Right. It's still epsilon energized.

35
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,890
>> Right. That makes a lot of sense, epsilon

36
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,960
energized. That's a pretty good name for a band. OK.

37
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,551
>> [LAUGH]
