Did you get x equals 1 or x equals 4? If so, well done. Let's see how we got

2
00:00:04,332 --> 00:00:09,025
these answers. We know when we're solving absolute value equations that we have

3
00:00:09,037 --> 00:00:13,530
to split it into two cases. We have the case when 2x minus 5 is positive, when

4
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:17,865
it will equal 3. And we also have the case when 2x minus 5 is negative 3. So

5
00:00:17,877 --> 00:00:22,400
we're going to solve each one of these equations independently. When we add 5 to

6
00:00:22,412 --> 00:00:27,552
both sides of the equation here we get 2x equals 8. Which means x equals 4 when

7
00:00:27,564 --> 00:00:33,024
we divide both sides by 2 and when we solve this equation add 5 to both sides I

8
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:38,328
get 2x equals 2 and when I divide both sides by 2 I get x equals 1. x equals 1

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,968
and x equals 4 are the solutions to this first absolute practice problem. Lets

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,853
try a few more.
