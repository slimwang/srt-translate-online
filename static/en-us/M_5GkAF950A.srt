00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,620
So let's look at the drawbacks of

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,250
the simple implementation of sequential consistency. Remember

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,990
that that simple implementation basically issues the

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,750
next access only when all prior accesses

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:15,260
are complete. So if you have out of order cores, what is the memory

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,550
level parallelism we get on each core by doing this? Put that number here.
