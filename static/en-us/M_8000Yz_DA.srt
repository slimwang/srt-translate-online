00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,201
>> Let's go through each one of these. With this first one, we take the square

2
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:14,755
root of the average square deviation. Well, the deviation is x i minus x bar.

3
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:21,271
The square deviation is then just x i minus x bar squared, and the average is

4
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:27,392
summing each squared deviation up and then dividing by n. And this is our

5
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,197
formula for standard deviation. The average square deviation is basically this

6
00:00:33,197 --> 00:00:38,467
inside the square root sign, but then instead of taking the square root, we

7
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:44,222
square it. This is not the standard deviation. The sum of square deviations,

8
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:50,039
well these are the square deviations so the sum is just this. Remember that this

9
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,913
is also called sum of squares. Sum of absolute deviations squared, the absolute

10
00:00:55,913 --> 00:01:01,220
deviation is xi minus x bar with the absolute values, and if we square them

11
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,781
that's the same as if we didn't take the absolute value. And then if we take the

12
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:11,773
sum, we get the sum of squares again, so these two are equivalent, and they're

13
00:01:11,773 --> 00:01:16,699
not the standard deviation. Finally, we have the sum of squared deviations,

14
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:21,418
divided by n, and then the square root of that. So that is also our formula for

15
00:01:21,418 --> 00:01:25,113
standard deviation. Good job. I know this was really hard.
