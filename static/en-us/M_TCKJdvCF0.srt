1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
So now let's look at this statement in a slightly different way.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,690
What would happen if you showed 1 NP complete problem

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,580
to be solvable only in exponential time.

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,570
So it's not solvable in polynomial time,

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,710
you show for 1 NP complete problem

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,430
that requires exponential time to solve,

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,420
on a deterministic RAM again, of course.

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,200
So would that mean that

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,110
some problems in NP are

10
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,240
only solvable in exponential time?

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,490
Would it mean that all NP complete problems

12
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,130
are only solvable in exponential time?

13
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,450
or would it mean that all problems in NP

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,560
are only solvable in exponential time?

15
00:00:35,560 --> 99:59:59,999
So please, once more, check all of those that are correct.
