00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,852
And now, finally, I would like you to actually graph this. Now, please first,

2
00:00:03,943 --> 00:00:07,808
just take a second, get out a piece of graph paper, create the same set of axis.

3
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:11,739
I kind of hope you already did that before on your own anyway. And then, on that

4
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:15,591
set of axis, graph the points that we have on the table. After you've got that

5
00:00:15,603 --> 00:00:19,551
done, connect them using a ruler with a line. After you've done that, come back

6
00:00:19,563 --> 00:00:24,505
to this quiz on the computer and select all of the boxes on this grid where you

7
00:00:24,517 --> 00:00:26,580
think that these points belong.
