1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,690
So Paul, what do you guys do to
actually get out of the way when you're

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,010
testing with the user?

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,939
What questions do you ask them or what
statements do you give them to make sure

4
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:10,595
that they're comfortable just
taking the product as it is?

5
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:11,270
>> Mm-hm.

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,510
So by far the most important one is
to make sure that the user knows

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,480
that we are not testing them,
we are testing the software.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,200
We will actually often make
that just 100% explicit,

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,640
say we are not testing you,
we are testing the program.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,800
If you feel like you're doing
something wrong, you're not,

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,530
our program is doing something wrong.

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,350
Then we kind of step back and
let them start using the software.

13
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,130
The other thing that we do during
tests which is really important is to

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,980
have the user think aloud.

15
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,350
So thinking aloud is a little bit
different than just talking or

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,770
just thinking, right?

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,610
One of the great, best ways that I've
found to get a user to think aloud, or

18
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,710
to understand what thinking aloud is,
is to ask them how many windows they

19
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,980
have in their house or their apartment,
and most people will say, four?

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,810
And you go,

21
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,440
okay, well hang on, walk me through
the process of how you got there.

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,950
And the user will go well,
I guess there are two in the kitchen,

23
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,460
then I turn left and there's another
little one there, so that's three, and

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,010
then I go upstairs and I guess there's
a couple windows on the staircase.

25
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,710
Okay, that's the process
we want you to go through.

26
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,884
We want to know what you're thinking
as your thinking, what you're noticing,

27
00:01:17,884 --> 00:01:22,310
what you're understanding when you
realize something we want to know that.

28
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,400
And then as the test goes on,
you kind of keep poking them and

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,185
keep prompting them.

30
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:27,470
>> Mm-hm.
>> And if they start to

31
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,480
get frustrated you go back and
remind them again.

32
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,900
This is great information for
us, you're doing nothing wrong.

33
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,620
This is exactly what we want to know,
yep.
