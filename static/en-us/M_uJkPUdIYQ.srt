00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,218
Let's start out by calculating the distance between M and N, or the distance

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,303
that we're just calling MN. I'm going to take the square root of a bunch of

3
00:00:08,315 --> 00:00:12,449
stuff. Our x-coordinates are 11 half and 2, and when you take the distance

4
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:16,473
between them, then we square that. We add to this the same thing for the

5
00:00:16,485 --> 00:00:21,525
y-coordinates. And then, we just simplify. After some more simplification, our

6
00:00:21,537 --> 00:00:26,875
final answer is the square root of 218 divided by 2. Interestingly enough, when

7
00:00:26,887 --> 00:00:32,225
we calculate the other's three side lengths, we get that PQ and MN have the same

8
00:00:32,237 --> 00:00:37,629
length, and also that NP and QM m have the same length. Let's keep this in mind

9
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:40,273
for discussion slightly later on.
