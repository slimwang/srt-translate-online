Let's say we have f of x equals log based 10 of x and f inverse of x equals 10

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,516
to the x. But what happens if we take the composition of these functions? What

3
00:00:10,516 --> 00:00:14,720
does f inverse of f of x look like? Now, since these functions are inverses,

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,279
you should already know what goes in this final box.
