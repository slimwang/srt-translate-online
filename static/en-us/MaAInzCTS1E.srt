[Thrun] For my next example, I will study a different type of a Bayes network.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Before, we've seen networks of the following type,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
where a single hidden cause caused 2 different measurements.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I now want to study a network that looks just like the opposite.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We have 2 independent hidden causes,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but they get confounded within a single observational variable.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I would like to use the example of happiness.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Suppose I can be happy or unhappy.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What makes me happy is when the weather is sunny or if I get a raise in my job,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
which means I make more money.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So let's call this sunny, let's call this a raise, and call this happiness.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Perhaps the probability of it being sunny is 0.7,

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
probability of a raise is 0.01.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And I will tell you that the probability of being happy is governed as follows.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The probability of being happy given that both of these things occur--

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I got a raise and it is sunny--is 1.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The probability of being happy given that it is not sunny and I still got a raise is 0.9.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The probability of being happy given that it's sunny but I didn't get a raise is 0.7.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And the probability of being happy given that it is neither sunny nor did I get a raise is 0.1.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is a perfectly fine specification of a probability distribution

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
where 2 causes affect the variable down here, the happiness.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So I'd like you to calculate for me the following questions.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Probability of a raise given that it is sunny, according to this model.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
