As you continue learning about EDA in the next

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,840
lessons, you'll get to hear from Moira. Moira's done

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,180
some exciting work at Facebook and she'll be sharing

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,170
one of her projects with you. Let's hear from her.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,660
>> So one of the things that I've been looking at

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:17,540
lately is whether people's perception of their audience on Facebook matches up

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,250
to the reality. Who's actually seeing the content that they're sharing. Because

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,450
who think is in your audience really affects how you present yourself.

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,580
So to investigate this problem, I worked with Michael

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,210
Bernstein, Brian Carr, and Eytan Bakshy. And together we

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,470
ran a survey where we pointed people to a

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,340
post that they'd made in the last couple of

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,260
weeks, and we said, how many people do you

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,430
think saw this post? And then we took their

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,650
responses to that question and we actually counted how

16
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,000
many people had viewed that post for about a second

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
at least and we found that there was a pretty big

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,720
mismatch between people's perceived audience

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,040
size and their actual audience size.
