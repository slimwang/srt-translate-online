00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:06,394
This hypotenuse is the square root of 241. This square root would be about 15

2
00:00:06,394 --> 00:00:12,107
and a half. Great thinking if you got this exact answer. For this problem, we

3
00:00:12,107 --> 00:00:17,137
know the legs are 4 and 15, and the hypotenuse is x. It's unknown, since we

4
00:00:17,137 --> 00:00:22,839
don't know it. So we'll have 4 squared plus 15 squared equals x squared. We'll

5
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:29,253
square 4 to get 16 and we'll square 15 to get 225. Adding these two together,

6
00:00:29,253 --> 00:00:34,222
we'll get 241 equals X squared. We'll take the square root of both sides,

7
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:38,675
keeping only the positive root, since this is a distance; which gives us x

8
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:45,090
equals the square root of 241. Again, great work, if you got this correct.
