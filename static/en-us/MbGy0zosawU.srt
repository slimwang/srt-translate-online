00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,760
A /20 prefix is, 2 to the 4th, or 16/24th's.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,210
And I need to basically represent 16 entries, at the

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,820
24 bit level, of the trie or the second level.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,940
And therefore, I'd need 16 entries to represent, a /20 prefix.
