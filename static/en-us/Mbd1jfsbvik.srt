1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,250
The answer here is just income level. Gender would not

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,880
be considered an ordered factor, since it doesn't make sense

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,410
to rank male and female groups. The military service and

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,550
children variables are binary variables with yes or no values, so

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,560
these really wouldn't make sense to order either. Using the

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,040
same thinking, it doesn't really make sense to order the levels

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,580
of country and state variables, since we wouldn't rank those

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,500
either. We wouldn't really say one location is better than another.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,770
And finally, cheese falls into the same bucket as military service and children,

10
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,960
because it's binary, so this one's out too. The income levels actually have

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,230
a natural order to them where we can group the buckets from lowest

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,460
to highest, or from highest to lowest. That's what make it an ordered factor.
