00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,067
Sum of squares for between group variability and within group variability add

2
00:00:04,067 --> 00:00:10,769
to the total sum of squares. 54 plus 6 equals 60. You learned this in the last

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,740
lesson, but I just wanted to remind you. And remember that the total sum of

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,150
squares is the sum of each square deviation, of each value in all the samples

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,210
from the grand mean.
