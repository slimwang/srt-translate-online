00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,050
So, our portfolio page is looking pretty good.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,320
Especially now that we've got these adorable little kittens here

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,560
that just make me want to sneeze.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm only sneezing because I'm allergic to cats.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,540
I mean I think they're really cute,

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,360
but I can't get too close to them without a Zyrtec.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,280
Anyways, so we're in our portfolio and

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,190
it would be awesome if we could say a little bit more about,

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,670
you know, what we did here, and what we did here on our app and framework.

10
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,990
But there's not a whole lot of space for

11
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,740
it, however there is a trick we can use.

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,500
We can click on it and

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,370
bring up a modal which actually has more information about the project.

14
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,450
This modal is a Bootstrap feature that uses JavaScript but

15
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,730
don't worry, in order to implement it you don't need to know any JavaScript.

16
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,550
For this assignment I want you to implement a modal just like the one

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,990
we have here.

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,740
Here we are inside Bootstrap's documentation for modals.

19
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,080
This is in the JavaScript section.

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,530
I'm going to scroll down to an example.

21
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,070
All right, we've got our simple example just like the one we saw.

22
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,150
This is the HTML that was used to create the modal.

23
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,860
Here we have the trigger that opens up the modal.

24
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,507
Notice that it's got two attributes we haven't seen before,

25
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:09,120
data-toggle and data-target.

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,430
In this example, these attributes are attached to a button.

27
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,210
But, in our case, we'll be attaching them to the images in our portfolio.

28
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,730
Inside the instructor notes,

29
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,860
you'll find some HTML that looks a lot like what you see here.

30
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,110
We want you to copy the HTML you find in your instructor's notes to your own

31
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:29,160
page, and it should be inside the body of your page, not inside any divs.

32
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,240
Notice here that this HTML has an id which in this case is myModal.

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,060
You can add as many modals as you want.

34
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,970
Just make sure each one has its own unique ID.

35
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,240
Notice how this ID matches up with the data target above.

36
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,890
Modals here work because of the bootstrap.min.js file that you

37
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,690
should already have in your project.

38
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,120
Go ahead and see if you can add a modal to your page.

39
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,290
Once you've finished adding your modal, click this box to continue.
