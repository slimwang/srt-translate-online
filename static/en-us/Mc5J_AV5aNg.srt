The goal of modules is to support modular design. That shouldn't be too

2
00:00:03,916 --> 00:00:07,448
surprising, that's where the name modules comes from. And what that means is

3
00:00:07,448 --> 00:00:11,034
that if we have a large system, we can break it down into pieces. And the

4
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:14,574
important thing about how we break it down into pieces is that in order to

5
00:00:14,574 --> 00:00:18,468
understand the whole system, we don't need to understand all the details of all

6
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:23,395
the pieces at once. We can understand each piece by itself. So to understand the

7
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:27,425
red piece we only need to understand the red piece, we don't need to know the

8
00:00:27,425 --> 00:00:31,480
details of the blue and the green piece. The only thing we need to understand

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,140
about the green piece is the interface between the red piece and the green

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,464
piece. Similarly if we're working on the green piece. We don't need to

11
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:41,634
understand all the details of the red piece and the blue piece. We just need to

12
00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:43,943
understand the interfaces between the pieces.
