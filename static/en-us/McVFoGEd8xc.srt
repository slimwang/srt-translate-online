00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,360
Whoa! We're not quite done yet. This was the original end of

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,060
the class. And if you've made it this far and learned everything that

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,320
we've covered, you definitely accomplished a lot. And you've learned a lot

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,580
about computer science, as well as

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,000
Python programming. But we've learned that it's

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,680
very hard for students based on just this to be ready for

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,980
the next level of classes. So we added a few extra units that

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,450
I think will prepare you for that. As well as get you to

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,900
the next level as a programmer. The main focus of the extra units.

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,150
Is on how to mange complexity. This is something that becomes more

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,583
and more important as your programs get longer and more complicated. As well

12
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,600
as if you start working in teams to build larger programs. Where you

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,574
have to understand other peoples code, and they have to understand your code.

14
00:00:38,574 --> 00:00:41,770
As you develop as a programmer, learning how to mange complexity becomes

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,720
more and more important, and these new units will teach you tools and

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,230
techniques for how to do that. I congratulate you on getting to the

17
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,020
end of the original course, but hope you'll stick with it, and join

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,860
me for the new units.
