00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,649
So, thanks Susan. So, how does our body respond to stress? Well, a physiologist

2
00:00:05,649 --> 00:00:09,245
by the name of Hans Selye studied this, and he discovered that there were in

3
00:00:09,245 --> 00:00:15,030
fact three distinct phases to the stress response. There's the alarm,

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:21,404
resistance and exhaustion. So, in stage one of the stress response, we have the

5
00:00:21,404 --> 00:00:25,710
alarm stage. And in this stage, we're exposed to some kind of stress or

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,625
stresser, and our body responds two ways. First, the sympathetic nervous system

7
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:36,391
releases catecholamines. And secondly the adrenal glands of the of the HPA axis

8
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:41,770
releases cortisol. Now and this is our bodies preparation to deal with the

9
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,934
stress. But long term exposure to cortisol compromises our immune function as

10
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:47,438
we saw with

11
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:47,942
[UNKNOWN]

12
00:00:47,942 --> 00:00:53,856
Susan. So, our bodies can't handle being in the alarm stage too long. We either

13
00:00:53,856 --> 00:00:59,605
die or we cope. And if we cope, we enter Stage two, called resistance. And in

14
00:00:59,605 --> 00:01:04,955
resistance, cortisol is still being released throughout our bodies. And this

15
00:01:04,955 --> 00:01:10,654
cortisol helps activate us, arouses us and maintains a response. Now, long term

16
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:15,550
arousal though, is not good for our bodies, as we'll see here more in a minute.

17
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,572
So, in the third and final stage, we have exhaustion. And in the exhaustion

18
00:01:19,572 --> 00:01:23,348
stage, what's going on is our body's been trying to fight this threat for such

19
00:01:23,348 --> 00:01:28,519
a long time that we've become depleted of it's resources. And we have no

20
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,018
ability to fight off illness, because our immune system is compromised. In

21
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:36,277
fact, I'm sure many of you have gotten sick during finals. That's due to

22
00:01:36,277 --> 00:01:38,710
exhaustion and lowered immune response.
