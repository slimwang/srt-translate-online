1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,470
Okay, so here's where we left off
with the app in the last exercise.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,838
It's interactive, but barely.

3
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:11,730
Partially because it's not
really saving any information.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,560
Sounds like we're going to need
a variable, or variables, and

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,590
I want you to help me plan what
variables that you'll need.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,310
Now in this simple version of the app,
there's no ability to reset, and

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,180
we're only talking about one team,
Team A.

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,280
Given that we know that when you
click a button we want the score

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,010
to increase here.

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,980
Can you tell me what variable,
or variables,

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,830
that you think we need to create for
this app to work?

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,740
I've given you a number of
options to select from,

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,280
check which of these you
think we need a variable for.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,100
Do we need a variable to keep
track of the number of points for

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,930
a 3 point shot, or
a 2 point shot, or a free throw?

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,706
Do we need a variable for the number
of shots attempted, a variable for

17
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:53,720
the number of fouls,
and/or a variable for the score?
