1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,970
So where is finger retrieving all of
this information such as our user name,

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,240
our home directories, the shell?

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,650
Much of this information is found
within a file that stores information

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,010
about each user.

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,290
This file is called etc/passwd.

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,670
Let's take a look at that
file using the cat command.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,150
Each line within this file is
an entry for a single user, and

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:28,390
each entry has a number of fields that
are separated by colon characters.

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,930
Let's find the entry for
our current user, vagrant.

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:31,982
The line looks like this,

11
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:36,920
vagrant:x:1000:1000:
:/home/vagrant:/bin/bash.

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,240
These two numbers 1000:1000 might
be different on your system, but

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,840
that's okay.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,630
It's nothing to worry about.

15
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,910
The first field reads vagrant and
that's this users username.

16
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,520
The second field used to
store encrypted passwords.

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,320
Historically storing encrypted
passwords in this file wasn't an issue

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,140
as the hardware was too slow to
crack a well chosen password.

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,170
These days, almost every distribution
will just insert a character that is

20
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,350
ignored in this field.

21
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,220
In this case, ubuntu uses an x.

22
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,500
The third and fourth field store
your user ID and group ID.

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,130
We'll discuss these a bit more when we
get into talking about file permissions.

24
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,710
There's a fifth field here that may be
hard to see since it doesn't include

25
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,870
any text.

26
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,030
It's empty.

27
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,970
This field is used to store a better
description about this user.

28
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,900
You can see one user does have
a better description here.

29
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,380
Gnat's and then this full description,
gnats bug reporting system admin.

30
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,020
The last two fields are the user's
home directory and finally,

31
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,870
the user's default shell.

32
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,740
Our home directory is
/home/vagrant as we already knew.

33
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,294
And our default shell is bin/bash.
