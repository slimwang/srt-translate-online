00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,550
A formal explanation of Virtualization
is given in an old paper by Povek and

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,750
Goldberg from 1974.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,200
There is a link to that paper
in the instructor's notes.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,820
We'll go through the ideas that
are presented in that paper and

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,110
we will explain how to
define Virtualization.

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,790
The definition states that a virtual
machine is taken to be an efficient

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,770
isolated duplicate of the real machine.

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,500
Virtualization is enabled through
a virtual machine monitor, or VMM.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,750
This is the layer that enables
virtual machines to exist.

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,030
As a piece of software,

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,700
the virtual machine monitor has
three essential characteristics.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,540
The virtual machine monitor
provides an environment for

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,900
programs that's essentially
identical with the original machine.

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,370
As I said the capacity may differ,

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:53,260
however it would be the same kind of CPU
that the virtual machine thinks it has.

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,310
The same types of devices, etc.

17
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,510
What this means is that as the, one of
the goals of the virtual machine monitor

18
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,920
is that it must provide some fidelity

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,790
that the representation of the hardware
that's visible to the, in the virtual

20
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,230
machine matches the hardware that's
available on the physical platform.

21
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,230
Second, programs that run in
this environment show at worst

22
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,690
only minor decrease in speed.

23
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,910
Now, clearly we have a situation
where the operating system and

24
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,540
its processes in the virtual
machine are given only

25
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,230
two CPUs as opposed to the four that
are available on the physical machine.

26
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,510
This won't execute exactly at the same
level, it wouldn't be able to complete

27
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,990
the programs as fast as
if they were in natively.

28
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,090
However the goal of the virtual machine
monitor is that if the virtual machine

29
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,530
were given the exact amount of
resources as the physical machine,

30
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,030
then the operating system, and

31
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:57,140
the processes, would be able
to perform at the same speeds.

32
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,280
So another goal of the virtual machine
monitor, is to deliver performance

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,870
to the VMs that's as close to
the need of performance as possible.

34
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:10,360
And last, the VMM is in complete
control of the system resources.

35
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,890
This means that the virtual machine
monitor has full control to make

36
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,820
decisions, who accesses which
resources and when, and

37
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,830
it can be relied upon to ensure
safety and isolation among the VMs.

38
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,600
This doesn't mean that every single
hardware access has to be inspected

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,080
by the VMM layer.

40
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,020
Instead, what this means is that
the virtual machine monitor determines

41
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,080
if a particular VM is to be
given direct hardware access.

42
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,040
And also that, once those decisions
are put in place, a virtual machine can

43
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,630
not just change those policies, and
potentially hurt other collocated VMs.

44
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,842
So one of the goals for
the virtual machine monitor is

45
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:56,577
that it has to provide for
safety and isolation guarantees.
