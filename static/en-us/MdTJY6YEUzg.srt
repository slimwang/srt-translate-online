00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,758
There's a really cool thing
you can do about this, and

2
00:00:02,758 --> 00:00:04,473
it's something called a dolly zoom.

3
00:00:04,473 --> 00:00:07,497
And this was an effect that I think,
at least I've been told,

4
00:00:07,497 --> 00:00:10,010
was invented by Alfred Hitchcock.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:15,050
Basically, if you move closer and
closer to something, but you widen

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,440
out the lens at the same time,
you'll cause the object and

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,628
subject in the middle to stay about
the same size and to be stationary.

8
00:00:24,628 --> 00:00:27,564
But it's going to be very weird, because
what's going to happen is that all

9
00:00:27,564 --> 00:00:29,988
the stuff from the outside is
going to look like it grows.

11
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:44,928
And in the slides and study guide on
YouTube is a link to the original.

12
00:00:44,928 --> 00:00:48,292
And there's also another link put
out by somebody who wanted to

13
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:50,014
just demonstrate this effect.

14
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:53,131
And they did it for even a longer time,
and you can get to see that.
