00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,201
Here are the correct expressions. If you got these, excellent work. I know these

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:08,220
last two were pretty tricky. So, it's okay if you didn't get them right on your

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,208
first try. First, we can distribute the 5th power to the 7 squared and the x

4
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:16,398
squared. Now, we apply our power to our power rule. We multiply 2 times 5 to get

5
00:00:16,398 --> 00:00:20,962
7 to the 10th. And 2 times 5 to get x to the 10th. We could only distribute this

6
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:25,787
power of 5, because they had factors here. Numbers and variables multiplied

7
00:00:25,787 --> 00:00:29,862
together. Then next one, we distribute the square to 3 to the 1, n cubed and n

8
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:34,460
squared. And we get this. We multiply the exponents together to get 3 squared. N

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,840
to the 6th, and n to the 4th. Finally, for the last one, we carry out the same

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,460
steps. We have a cubed, cubed. B squared cubed and c to the 1 cubed. Raising a

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,296
power to a power. We get a to the 9th, b to the 6th and c cubed. There's our

12
00:00:50,296 --> 00:00:51,345
final answer.
