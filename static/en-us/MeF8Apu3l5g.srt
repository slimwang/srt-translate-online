00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,144
We had to take corrective action when we transformed normals by a scale matrix,

2
00:00:04,144 --> 00:00:08,395
needing the inverse transpose in the worst case. For rotation and translation we

3
00:00:08,395 --> 00:00:12,663
could use the same matrix for normals that we used for points. So the question

4
00:00:12,663 --> 00:00:17,278
to you is what happens to normals if they're transformed by the same mirroring

5
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,123
matrix used for transforming points? Your choices are the transforms works only

6
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:26,597
if the normal is perpendicular to the mirror. The transform works only if the

7
00:00:26,597 --> 00:00:31,468
normal is parallel to the mirror. The transform works all the time, but you must

8
00:00:31,468 --> 00:00:36,665
normalize the normal afterwards. Or the transform works all the time. If you

9
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:40,873
need a hint, think about Alice through the looking glass.
