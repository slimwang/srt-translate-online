00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,325
I want to illustrate one more thing with our, somewhat silly, I guess, really

2
00:00:04,325 --> 00:00:08,355
silly example which allows us to get even more reuse, which is our real goal

3
00:00:08,355 --> 00:00:12,746
with inheritance. So, both the GrizzlyBear and the BlackBear classes have chase

4
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:16,942
methods. And what these methods do is pretty similar. If the victim is up the

5
00:00:16,942 --> 00:00:20,695
tree. They do something different. The GrizzlyBear knocks down the tree, the

6
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:25,202
BlackBear climbs the tree. Otherwise, they do the same thing. So, we'd really

7
00:00:25,202 --> 00:00:30,012
like to reuse almost all of this code and assuming there's chase people too and

8
00:00:30,012 --> 00:00:34,600
what we'd really like to do is move the shared parts of the chase method into

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,114
Bear and only deal with the special case, where the victim's up the tree in

10
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:43,841
GrizzlyBear and BlackBear. Here's one way we might deal with this, which is to

11
00:00:43,841 --> 00:00:48,566
use the built in isinstance operator. And this returns true if the object is an

12
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:53,023
instance of the class or one of its supertypes. Otherwise, it returns false.
