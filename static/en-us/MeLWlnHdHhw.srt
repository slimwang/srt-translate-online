1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The answer is 1/19th for a2, c2, and b3, and 16/19th or 0.8421 for b2.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
To see, let's associate the nonnormalized probability value to each of the particles.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Over here, we have 0.1. Here is 0.8, but if 2 particles, let's make this 1.6.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
0.1 and 0.1 again.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
These nonnormalized importance weights add up to 1.9,

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
so the desired result is the division of the original particle weights by 1.9,

7
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which is the value as shown on the left.
