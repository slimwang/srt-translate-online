I know that you have quit filling out
a massive form like this one before.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,100
I know you've groaned when you've come
across some huge form with a million

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,180
pages and tons of little radio buttons,
because nobody likes to click these for

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:14,770
hours on end.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,000
So, with that in mind,
I want you to brainstorm some

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,780
questions that people ask when they
come across big forms like this one.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,510
The reason why is that one of
the most important skills for

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,460
any developer is empathy.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,220
Empathy is the ability to see the world
through somebody else's perspective.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,540
Any one who creates any thing for

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,560
any other people needs
a strong sense of empathy.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,180
And that includes web developers.

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,350
Remember, you're building a website for
your users, not for yourself.

14
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,070
So this questions is going to
be a free response question.

15
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,800
See this long form?

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,880
Ask yourself,
what are you thinking when you see it?

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,510
What do you want to
know before you start?

18
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,970
What kind of knowledge
would help you finish it?

19
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,600
Type your answer into this box, and

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,530
in the solution video,
I'll show you what I think.

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,590
Share your answer in the forums,

22
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,460
too, because maybe one of you will
catch something that I didn't.
