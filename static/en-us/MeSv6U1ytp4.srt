1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,348
The product is 21 m cubed plus 15m to the 5th. Excellent work if you reasoned

2
00:00:04,348 --> 00:00:08,584
through that one. If you weren't sure where to start, always start with the

3
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:13,087
rectangle. We know this is one number, so this can be one side of a rectangle.

4
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:17,548
This is our second number. 7m squared plus 5m to the 4th. We want to split it up

5
00:00:17,548 --> 00:00:22,184
into 2 parts. Since we have 7m squared. Plus 5m to the fourth these would be

6
00:00:22,184 --> 00:00:27,075
different numbers. Think about if m were 2 this number would be 28 and this

7
00:00:27,075 --> 00:00:31,985
number would be 90. But we really don't know what m is so, we have to leave it

8
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:36,958
with these expressions. Next we multiply 3m by each of the terms to find the

9
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:41,826
area. 3m times 7m squared. Is 21m cubed. There's a 1 as the exponent on the m,

10
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:46,493
so remember to add the exponents when multiplying with the same base. Our two

11
00:00:46,493 --> 00:00:51,225
numbers, 3 and 7, just get multiplied as usual. Next we multiply 3m times 5m to

12
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:55,665
the 4th, that will give us the area of this rectangle, 3 times 5 is 15, and m

13
00:00:55,665 --> 00:01:00,053
times m to the 4th, is m to the 5th. We don't have like terms here so we can't

14
00:01:00,053 --> 00:01:04,355
add these together. We have an area of 21m cubed and an area of 15m to the 5th.

15
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:08,641
This is our total area. And instead of writing your entry like this, you might

16
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:12,997
have listed your entry like this or rearrange the terms and written your answer

17
00:01:12,997 --> 00:01:17,308
like this. This one is actually preferred. It's in standard form because the

18
00:01:17,308 --> 00:01:21,236
highest exponent comes first. When writing your answers for the rest of this

19
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:24,804
lesson, you'll want to write them in standard form. Variables are usually listed

20
00:01:24,804 --> 00:01:27,085
alphabetically, and the highest powers come first.
