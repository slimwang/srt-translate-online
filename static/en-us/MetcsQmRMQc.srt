00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,915
This first one is true. The greater the variability of each individual sample,

2
00:00:04,915 --> 00:00:10,500
the less likely a population means will differ significantly. That's less

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,218
likely than this case. And similarly, the smaller the variability of each

4
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:20,726
individual sample, the more likely they will differ significantly. The

5
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:26,255
variability of individual samples is called Within group variability.
