1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So what can we change?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Do we have to change the function poker?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Do we have to change the function hand rank?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Do we have to change the function card ranks?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Or the function straight?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now, I said I wanted to get it down to changing 1 function,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but that might not be possible, so select all the functions

8
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that you think are going to need changes in order to accommodate that ace-low straight.
