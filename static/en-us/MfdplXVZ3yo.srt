1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,150
Another direct challenge is Pull,
automating the retrieval of data.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:10,532
So far we've only discuss the fax
machine replacement-use case where Dr.

3
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:16,230
Johnson sends a patient chart to Dr.
Jones when he refers Marla to her.

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,360
Suppose Dr. Jones wants
information from Dr. Johnson.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,235
Suppose Marla has started recording
her blood glucose readings at home and

6
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:31,090
Dr. Johnson wants to retrieve the most
recent ones to see how she's doing.

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:36,160
Suppose Marla has established a personal
health record and wants it automatically

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,930
updated whenever there's new information
in any of her medical records.

9
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,190
These are all examples of Pull,
where the recipient,

10
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,180
not the sender, initiates the message.

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,330
Accomplishing this is
still in the future, but

12
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,810
a group of experts have proposed how
it might be done, as shown here.

13
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,670
Using some new standards within
Direct for requesting information and

14
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,870
sending back a response.

15
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,800
This would be done using
specially formatted XML documents,

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,260
similar to constructs that already
exist in quality reporting and

17
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,280
that we'll see in lesson eight.

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,680
Another interesting aspect of this
proposal that's not specifically limited

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,910
to Direct is that all of
the patient's data would be stored

20
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,750
in a repository that would receive and
respond to these requests,

21
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,200
presumably based on each patient's
information sharing preferences.

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,450
Many people propose something like this
to simplify the privacy issues we'll

23
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,390
discuss in lesson four.
