00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:04,542
Well, first thing's first, I wanted the answer to this question to be in minutes,

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:08,307
but the time we have up here is 8 hours

3
00:00:08,307 --> 00:00:11,220
so let's convert that to minutes to start off.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,807
So 8 hours times 60 minutes in one hour gives us 480 minutes.

5
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:21,699
Great, so this is the exposure time for an 85 decibel sound.

6
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:24,254
We want to know what this is for a 100 decibel sound,

7
00:00:24,254 --> 00:00:26,903
so let's look at this last piece of information.

8
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:31,275
If the exposure time before damage is cut in half every time the power doubles,

9
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:35,928
we need to think about how many times the power doubles from 85 decibels to 100 decibels.

10
00:00:35,928 --> 00:00:40,332
We knew before that it was 5 times.

11
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:45,798
So if the power doubles 5 times, that means that our exposure time is halved 5 times.

12
00:00:45,798 --> 00:00:51,631
So we need to take 480 minutes and multiply it by one half five times.

13
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:53,712
That doesn't seem too bad.

14
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:56,669
However, we know that if we want to multiply by one half five times,

15
00:00:56,669 --> 00:01:00,648
that's the same as multiplying by one half to the fifth power.

16
00:01:00,648 --> 00:01:07,117
One half to the fifth is one over 32, so we're actually dividing 480 by 32.

17
00:01:07,117 --> 00:01:11,402
And that gives us a final answer of 15 minutes.

18
00:01:11,402 --> 00:01:16,102
Now remember that every time the power doubles, we have a decibel increase of 3.

19
00:01:16,102 --> 00:01:24,584
Some sources state that instead of the exposure time being cut in half for every three decibels, this happens every five decibels,

20
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:28,822
but I think it's better that we stay on the safe side.

21
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,892
I bet you never thought we would end up talking about ear health

22
00:01:30,892 --> 00:01:32,247
by the end of this course.

23
00:01:32,247 --> 00:01:35,465
But that just goes to show you how incredibly applicable algebra is,

24
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:39,259
in all spheres of life. In just this lesson

25
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:41,366
we've talked about everything from sound

26
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:46,944
to carbon dating, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the population of the world,

27
00:01:46,944 --> 00:01:50,944
and this happened in just a few questions.
