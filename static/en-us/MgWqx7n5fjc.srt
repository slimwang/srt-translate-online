1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,200
Okay, so you saw that the UI button has
an intrinsic size based on the text and

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,960
image it may contain.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,455
That means we only need two constraints
to center this button on our view.

4
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:13,790
One for the x coordinate, and
one for the y coordinate.

5
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:19,050
There are two ways to add these
constraints, and I'll cover both here.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,790
With the record button selected,

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,940
you can click on the align button
that looks like a bar graph.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,110
If you're having trouble
finding the record button,

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,460
remember to use you document
outline here and select it there.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,299
With the record button selected,
click on the align button,

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,930
which looks like a bar graph here,
and then select these two options on

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,300
the bottom to center it horizontally and
vertically in the container.

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,280
And then select add two constraints.

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,490
We can now see both constraints in the
record button in the document outline.

15
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,770
You can expand these triangles if
you want to see them actually here.

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,400
And, if you're like me, you may have
encountered the first on a layout issue,

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,820
which is these orange lines
that you see here, or

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,130
this yellow disclosure here
that you can see at the top.

19
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,110
Now, let's fix that
first before we run it.

20
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:10,070
So if you click on this tiny arrow,
we can see that Xcode expects that our

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,470
button be on X of 276, width of 29 and

22
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,110
height of 30, and its height is 32.

23
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,940
So if we expand this
out a little bit and

24
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,100
click on this one,
we can get it to fix the frame.

25
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,960
That is to fix the size of the button so

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,440
it matches the constraints
that we've declared.

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,260
We'll do that.

28
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,610
We can see it's trimmed a record
button to fit just the text or

29
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,630
just intrinsic size of our button.

30
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,710
Let's see if adding
these constraints works.

31
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,820
Let's select the iPhone 6s here
on the simulator drop down, and

32
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,510
press the run button, or
hit command and r on your keyboard.

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,370
We should see the record button
on the center of the screen.

34
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,870
With the iPhone simulator selected,
press and hold down the command key, and

35
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,310
then use the right or
left arrows to rotate the simulator.

36
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,620
I'm going to use the right arrow here
to rotate it to landscape right.

37
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,060
And I can use the left arrow
to rotate back to portrait.

38
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,900
In both orientations, we can see that
our button stayed in the center.

39
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,100
Now let's try it on an iPad Air 2
which is a lot larger than iPhone 6s.

40
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,780
If I move this to the side,

41
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,460
we can go back into Xcode,
and press the stop button.

42
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:29,700
We can here in the drop-down
select an iPad Air 2 and hit run.

43
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,380
Now we have a record button, but

44
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,850
it looks like our iPad simulator
is too big to fit on our screen.

45
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,640
What do we do?

46
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,290
We could go out and buy a large tunnel
of display, and I would recommend that.

47
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,870
We could petition Johnny Ive to bring
back the 17 inch Macbook Pro laptop.

48
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,350
Well, there's an easier option.

49
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,850
With the iPhone simulator selected,
let's go in to window, and then scale.

50
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,660
And you can choose
a different size here.

51
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,350
For example, let's do 33%.

52
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,160
That makes our iPad a lot smaller.

53
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,540
And we can see it.

54
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,088
We can use the command keys to jump
around between those sizes, too.

55
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:05,545
For example,
Cmd+3 will get us a little bit bigger,

56
00:03:05,545 --> 00:03:09,160
Cmd+2 will get us even bigger and
now it's, again, offscreen.

57
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,010
So let's stick with Cmd+3.

58
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,990
Here you can see the record button is
still in the center of the screen,

59
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,410
even if I use Cmd and arrow keys to
rotate the iPad to landscape right,

60
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,470
or back to landscape left.

61
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,920
By the way, these options just scale
down the size of the ioS simulator as

62
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,200
a whole to what you're seeing.

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,290
For your app,
everything is still the same size.
