00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,176
Even though composition of functions 
probably felt quite new at the beginning

2
00:00:03,176 --> 00:00:06,074
of this lesson, you've actually been 
doing it since the very first lesson of

3
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:09,400
this course. 
There, we came up with an equation for

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,780
the amount of money that Grant has left 
at any given time.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,376
Initially, we said that the money Grant 
has left Is equal to the money he got

6
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:22,200
from his venture capital funders, minus 
the total amount of money he spent so far.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,280
Here, we're using dollar amounts for all 
these different quantities.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,320
Then, however, we found out that money 
spent changed as time passed.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,712
Then we got a second equation, showing 
that the total amount of money spent is

10
00:00:34,712 --> 00:00:38,104
equal to the money Grant spends per month 
times the number of months that have

11
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:42,720
passed, or the number of months he's been 
in business.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,280
Let's get some variables and numbers back 
in here, to make everything look a bit cleaner.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,062
Let's say that the money Grant has left 
is called M.

14
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:57,340
And as we knew before, he started out 
with $3 million from his venture capitalists.

15
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,030
Let's also give total money spent a new 
name, like S.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,176
Well that looks way nicer. 
We can see M is actually a function of S.

17
00:01:05,176 --> 00:01:08,062
It depends on S. 
So I'm going to change this left side of

18
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:12,620
the equation to read M of S. 
But, S itself is a function of the number

19
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,182
of months that have passed. 
Since Grant spends a set amount iof money

20
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:20,798
per month, that monthly spending number 
was $100,000.

21
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:25,500
So if we say that number of months is 
just equal to n, then we have another function.

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,014
S equals 100,000 n. 
And actually, since S is a function of n,

23
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:32,756
we should rewrite this side over here. 
This should say S of n.

24
00:01:32,756 --> 00:01:37,440
Making it abundantly clear that as n 
changes, S is going to change as well.

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,829
Taking all this into account, what do we 
get for M of S of n?
