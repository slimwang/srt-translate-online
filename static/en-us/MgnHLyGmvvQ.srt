00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,622
We know that f of a is what we get if we plug a in the slot of x into our

2
00:00:03,622 --> 00:00:09,715
function. So that means that the quantity a minus 5 times the quantity a plus 3

3
00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:14,150
equals 0. If we want to find out what a equals, we just need to solve for a in

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,910
this equation. There are two ways that this expression right here can equal 0.

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,446
If either this factor equals 0 or if this factor equals 0. And we just solve

6
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:29,738
these two equations for A. As before we A equals 5 and A equals negative 3. So

7
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:33,760
these are the two roots of this function. They're the two values of X that make

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,286
F of X equal 0.
