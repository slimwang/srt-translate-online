00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here I've built a fake internet

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's a little smaller than the real internet, but it'll be a good example

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
for showing how we want to modify the crawler to solve the max pages problem.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The problem asks us to stop the crawler

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
from crawling the internet after we've reached a certain number of pages.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If this were the real internet, there'd be a lot more links. We'd have links going basically practically forever.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There are billions of pages on the internet, and if we took

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the code that we had at the end of this unit,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
then the crawler would go on for a very, very long time.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I leave it up to you to estimate how long it would take,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
but longer than this course has time available.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What we want to do for all practical reasons

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
is have the crawler stop after reaching a certain number of pages.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's pretty easy to do if we just count the number of pages

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
that we've seen as we go through our sample internet and simply check it

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
against the max pages passed into the function.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If we say max pages is equal to 3, what our crawler is going to do is start with A.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
From A, we're going to crawl A, then get B and C.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Then we're going to crawl C, and get D and E,

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but we now have crawl 3 pages, so we want to stop the process.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let's look at the code that we had at the end of the unit and modify it to do exactly this.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Here we have the crawl web function.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We take in a parameter--max pages--

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and we want to stop crawling once we've hit that number of pages crawled.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
An easy way to check is to simply look at the length of the crawled list,

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and we get that but using the len operator.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We don't only want to crawl a page if it hasn't been crawled,

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
but we also only want to crawl it if the length of the crawled list is less than max_pages.
