00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In my next question I would like to ask you about K-nearest neighbors.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Consider the following data set

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
where plus indicates a positive traning example

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and minus a negative training example in this 2-dimensional space.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I want you, for the following places,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
to check for those boxes over here

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
whether they will be plus for K=5.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Only check those boxes for which the label will be positive.
