Here's our last practice problem on completing the square. Notice that here we

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,650
don't have an a value of 1. We have an a value of 3. So, what do you think you

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,352
could do to solve here? Try taking an additional step here first and then try

4
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:17,260
completing the square. When you think you have it, write your answer here.
