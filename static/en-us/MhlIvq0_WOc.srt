1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the first case the answer is 0 because they're the same.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In the second case we have data identical to this. The answer is 0.25.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In this case it's the same, and in this case it's 0.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Expected variance is the average of these numbers or 0.125.
