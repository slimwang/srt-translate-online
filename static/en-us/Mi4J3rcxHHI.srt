1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The kind of method that we are using to solve the partial differential equation,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the heat equation that is, is professionally called the finite-difference scheme,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
because we are forming differences of values that fit in finite distances not infinite decimal distances.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Diagrammatically, what we are doing looks like this.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
They are using the current value of our current position and the current value to its left

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and the current value to its right to estimate the next value at our current position.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
There are other ways for doing this. This is the most simple, but obviously, it leads to instability.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In the previous quiz, we saw that this scheme has a particular issue with this sort of function.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
A function that oscillates up and down with each step in space.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So let's compute what happens with this Berry function.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Assume that this is our initial distribution of temperature.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Temperature at times 0 depending on x.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Of course, physically speaking, negative temperatures won't make sense

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and particularly are not without the unit of measurement.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But now, we're doing a little mathematics.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Now, let's compute what's going to be the next temperature at x equals to 0.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The result of the first step of the temperature at time h, h is the step size, and position 0

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
will be its former value times 0 and position 0 plus step size times the rate of change,

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and the rate of change is thermal diffusivity times the second derivative with respect to x,

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
which we estimate 1 over Δx².

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The old temperature to the left minus Δx plus the old temperature to the right

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
plus Δx minus 2 times the old temperature at 0.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So what's that going to be? The old temperature at position 0 equals 1. Same here.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The old temperature to the left equals -1 and that's to the right is -1 as well.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is 1-1-1-2, which makes -4 step size times thermal diffusivity divided by Δx².
