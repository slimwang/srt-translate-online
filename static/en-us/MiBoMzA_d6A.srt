1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,020
Remember, your goal here is to start with a series of hypotheses.

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,760
That's all you'll have on day 1.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,210
If you're a domain expert, maybe you know a little more,

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,910
but it's okay because you're just kind of guessing here.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,780
You start with, "Here's who I think my customers are,"

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,730
but then you get out of the building and you start running experiments,

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,720
and you find out, "Oh, I was right," or, more often on your first guesses, "I was wrong."

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,720
And because we're going to do these experiments cheaply,

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,320
inexpensively, and up front, we're going to save all the enormous waste we would do

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,690
if we waited until we launched the product and did an expensive marketing campaign

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,730
and then, only then, realizing that, "Oops! These weren't our customers,"

12
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,500
or, "These were our customers, but we built the wrong features."

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,430
So let's dive down a level deeper and first focus on what's the jobs needed to be done.

14
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,590
That is, what is the customer segment trying to get done?

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,430
And is it a problem or need?

16
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,540
This phrase "jobs to be done" was first popularized by Clayton Christensen,

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,330
who wrote a series of books.

18
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,710
The Innovator's Dilemma and The Innovator's Solution

19
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,000
should probably be on any entrepreneur's reading list.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,070
And what Christensen said is, "What functional or social jobs are getting done?"

21
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,300
That is, does the customer want to perform or complete a specific task

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,510
or solve a problem, or are they trying to look good, gain power or status?

23
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,770
Or are there some emotional jobs?

24
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,470
Do they want to look better, feel good, feel more secure?

25
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,440
And what basic needs are you helping your customer satisfy?

26
00:01:34,440 --> 99:59:59,999
Is it entertainment, is it dating, is it something hard wired into the human psyche?
