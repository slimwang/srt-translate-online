1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,490
Now let's summarize what we've
shown about the all-pairs

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,430
shortest path problem.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,850
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm,

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,790
which is based on dynamic programming,
finds the shortest path for all pairs of

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,800
vertices in a weighted graph in time
cubic in the number of vertices.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,480
Recall that we have to
fill out that whole table,

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,890
which has size v squared v times.

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,350
The key optimal similar substructure
came from considering optimal paths

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,210
by a restricted set of vertices,
1 through k.

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,881
And that gave us the recurrence, where
the shortest path between two vertices

11
00:00:33,881 --> 00:00:37,220
either used the new intermediate
vertex or it didn't.
