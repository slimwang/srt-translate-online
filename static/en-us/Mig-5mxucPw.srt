1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,030
We just completed the lesson on
matched pair design experiments, and

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,920
the course on A/B testing.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,750
Let's review what we've
covered in this lesson.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,850
Building on what we learned in the last
lesson, we walked through a pricing

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,410
elasticity problem, and learned
about using discrete variables and

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,850
trends to help match treatment and
control units in an experiment.

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,240
We also demonstrated the ability
to perform two tests in parallel.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,110
You've now completed
the course on A/B testing, and

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,570
know how to set up and conduct two types
of A/B testing experiments and analyze

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,260
the results to determine significance
to support your business decisions.

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,830
You're definitely ready to demonstrate
your understanding of A/B testing.

12
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:42,320
Excellent job.
