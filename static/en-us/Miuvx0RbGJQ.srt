00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,812
>> Considering the answer to the last quiz, that 2 and 3 are the numbers that

2
00:00:04,812 --> 00:00:10,012
add to equal 5 and multiple to equal 6, and also reflecting on the factored form

3
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:15,212
of this polynomial up here, the general one, what's a way we can write x squared

4
00:00:15,212 --> 00:00:20,295
plus 5x plus 6 in this form? Think about what a and b each equal, and then try

5
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:23,269
to replicate that in these two parantheses.
