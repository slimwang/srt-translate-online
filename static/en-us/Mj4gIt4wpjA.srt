00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,583
So first, let's group our x terms. We subtract 14 from both sides to obtain 4x

2
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:13,549
squared plus 16x equals y minus 14, then we complete the square. First, we have

3
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:19,789
to obtain the coefficient of 4 so that we can add 4 times 4 to both sides and

4
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:26,118
simplify. Giving us a solution of 4 times the quantity x plus 2 quantity squared

5
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:27,354
equals y plus 2.
