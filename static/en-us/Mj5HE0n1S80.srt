1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,782
>> That, well that's interesting, I mean, like with games there's a minimum

2
00:00:03,782 --> 00:00:09,412
requirements, you know, you must have this DirectX 11, or dadadadada. so, do

3
00:00:09,412 --> 00:00:12,402
you have like minimum requirements or are there sort of tiers of support or how

4
00:00:12,402 --> 00:00:14,000
does that work?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,820
>> We have a, minimum set of requirements for your system and for graphics card,

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,459
but we also have a very thorough certification process because. Even if a card

7
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:24,940
says that, you know, it runs DX11, it has all these effects, there can be

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:30,273
problems with a card of a driver. So we actually have to go through card driver

9
00:00:30,273 --> 00:00:34,108
combinations, certifying each one, run through a whole list of effects, make

10
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:39,497
sure they can do each one well and efficiently. Because depending on the

11
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:43,273
customer, some customers may want the visual accuracy and don't care as much

12
00:00:43,273 --> 00:00:47,500
about the performance. Some want the performance and don't care as much about

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,976
the visual accuracy. So depending on what it is we're striving for. If we have

14
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:54,356
an effect that looks really good but is slow, that will work for some customers

15
00:00:54,356 --> 00:00:56,560
but not all customers.

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,132
>> [CROSSTALK]

17
00:00:57,132 --> 00:01:01,299
There are also the frame rate issues that you see, particularly in games. Where

18
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:04,772
a game has to run at 30 hertz or 60 hertz. And, again, they will cut some

19
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:08,427
corners in order to, to be able to do that. We don't have those strict

20
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:12,572
requirements, in CAD. Although there are times when someone has a model. They

21
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:16,190
need to orbit it, they need to pan around. So, we do need to get good frame

22
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,838
rate out of that. And we'll actually play some of those same tricks, where

23
00:01:19,838 --> 00:01:23,510
we'll slightly degrade the visuals in order to be able to, to want, to see the

24
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,315
model moving, and then when you stop, we, we cut off the degradation and bring

25
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:29,723
back the original model.
