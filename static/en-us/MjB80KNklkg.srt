1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,021
If we look at the information on the top
half of the screen, this equation in

2
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:08,481
orange right here is completely related to
everything over here on the left. We know

3
00:00:08,493 --> 00:00:12,444
that instead of writing total money
earned, we can write a, like we have in

4
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:16,373
this bottom equation. So, we can cross
this out and put a. And since we've

5
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:20,618
figured out alternate expressions for
money earned from wipers and money earned

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:26,486
from nozzles, we can just substitute in
those new values in these slots. So, we

7
00:00:26,498 --> 00:00:32,641
know that money from wipers is also seen
over here, and it equals 36w. So, we can

8
00:00:32,653 --> 00:00:38,622
take 36w here, and put it here. We can do
the same thing with the money from the

9
00:00:38,634 --> 00:00:45,011
nozzles. Money from nozzles is 22n. So, we
can put that in this spot. Of course, we

10
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:51,209
want to keep the operators that join these
quantities together since we're just

11
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:57,654
calling these quantities different names.
So, we still have an equal sign and a plus

12
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:03,309
sign. So, we should have a=36w, move the
plus sign down, plus 22n. So our answer

13
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:07,393
choice must be, well here is that exact
thing written down, 36w+22n.

14
00:01:07,394 --> 00:01:11,928
The question is, are any of these other
answers right? Well, we can go through one

15
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,912
by one and eliminate ones we know are
wrong. This has a bunch of factors

16
00:01:15,924 --> 00:01:20,319
multiplied together, so does this one.
This one has four different terms added

17
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:24,509
together, and that's not what we're
looking for since we only have two terms

18
00:01:24,762 --> 00:01:29,713
up here. And all of the rest are at least
almost in the form that we're looking for.

19
00:01:29,818 --> 00:01:34,719
2w has never popped up anywhere for us
before. This would mean that 36 people are

20
00:01:34,731 --> 00:01:39,546
each paying Grant 2w dollars. We know that
in order to buy a set of wipers from

21
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:44,765
Grant, you only pay w dollars, and that 36
people bought wipers, so this answer is

22
00:01:44,777 --> 00:01:50,015
not correct. We need something with just
36w in it. If we look at the remaining

23
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:54,615
answers, there are some incorrect
combinations of coefficients and

24
00:01:54,627 --> 00:01:59,990
variables. We know that 36 goes with w,
not with n, so this answer can't be right,

25
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:05,090
or this one. And we know that the
coefficient of n needs to be 22. Since as

26
00:02:05,102 --> 00:02:09,324
we figured out a couple of quizzes ago,
11*2n=22n.

27
00:02:09,326 --> 00:02:15,012
And we want each of the 11 people who are
purchasing nozzles to buy two, so this

28
00:02:15,024 --> 00:02:21,277
answer isn't right, either. So, now we're
left with just two answers. 36w+2n, which

29
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:26,622
we know is right, and 22n+36w.
Now, this expression is actually exactly

30
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:31,790
equivalent to this one. So, it's right as
well. In order to say that this is true,

31
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:36,365
we have to use something called the
Commutative Property of Addition. This is

32
00:02:36,377 --> 00:02:41,410
really similar to the Commutative Property
of Multiplication that we've talked about

33
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:45,985
a lot already. Except that this time
instead of talking about switching order

34
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:53,894
when you multiply things, we're talking
about changing order when you add things

35
00:02:53,906 --> 00:03:00,246
together. So, just like we know that
2+3=5, we also know that 3+2=5.

36
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:05,729
That means we know that 2+3=3+2.
In the same way, if you have not just

37
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:11,078
numbers but numbers and variables. Let's
say, an expression like 36w+2n, you can

38
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,139
rearrange the order of the terms that are
added together and get an equivalent

39
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:20,515
expression like 22n+36w.
So, that means that both of these answer

40
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:21,868
choices were correct.
