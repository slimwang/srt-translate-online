00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,840
So, if I did this about 18 times, do you think you'd get it right most of the

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,200
time? Well you probably would, but now I want you to try it with help from Greg

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,170
and me. So here's your standard line. I want you to tell me which line you

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,968
think is closest in length to the standard line I showed you. I think it's this

5
00:00:15,968 --> 00:00:16,524
one.

6
00:00:16,524 --> 00:00:18,392
>> I think it's this one.

7
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:20,752
>> Type in the correct letter in this box.
