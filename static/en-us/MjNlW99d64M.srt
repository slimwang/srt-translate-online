1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Which of the following could be simplified or removed without changing the result?]

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So you may already have a good intuition for these sorts of optimizations.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let me give you a chance to show that off.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So here I've written a function in JavaScript called Plato's Republic.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's a function of 2 variables: A and B.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
A gets A times 1, B gets B + 0, A gets A + B,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
B gets B + 2, and then finally we return A.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There are 5 possible statements here.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Which of them can be simplified or removed

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
without changing the result?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And here I really want you to mostly focus on removing,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and note that this is a little trickier than it looks.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So give it some thought.
