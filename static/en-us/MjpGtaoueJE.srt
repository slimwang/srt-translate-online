00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,390
One example where we want to have more precision is a keyword search.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,090
You may have given some other examples.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,320
Look in the forum to see what other students have to say.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,500
In the case of the keyword search we might want some

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,550
documents retrieved that we are interested in.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,240
In this context precision corresponds directly to something you care about.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,740
How many of the documents you're showing your user

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,030
are actually relevant to them?

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:36,045
One thing to note here is that precision depends on the positive outcomes only.

10
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:39,260
Thus if you are interested in the positive class,

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,380
precision is a good metric to use.
