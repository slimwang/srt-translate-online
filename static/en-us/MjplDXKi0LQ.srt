1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,410
Things I will cover basically,

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,530
I'll introduce to you the concept
of video stabilization.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,510
We'll learn about how we can
estimate the camera emotion

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,360
just by analyzing the video given to us.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,560
We'll talk about how we can smooth
the camera paths to be able to then

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,920
synthesize a new camera view that
actually is much more smooth, stable.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,770
And how we can render
those stabilized videos.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,390
In addition to that, I will actually
introduce to you the problems associated

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,880
with something that is called
the rolling shutter artifact.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,420
That actually is predominantly
visible in lower-end CMOS sensors.

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,610
Again, remember,
we've talked about CMOS sensors.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,810
We'll talk about them again a little
bit here, and how we can actually

13
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,270
get rid of those in the case of video,
because again, this will actually

14
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,820
increase the amount of shaking during
a video because of the rolling shutter.
