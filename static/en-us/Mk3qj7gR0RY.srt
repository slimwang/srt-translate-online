1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,070
All right, let's do this in code.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,780
Write a function to down sample
an image to half its size.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,440
You can do this by picking
alternate rows and columns.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,320
Now write another function, this time
blur and then down sample the image.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,240
Here is a test image.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,560
I wonder how long you can
sit on that at a time.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,720
Ok, to relieve that guy of his misery,
let's down sample the image.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,700
This should be half the original size
that is half width, half height.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,670
Once more, and a third time.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,440
Let's do the same with the blur and
down sample function.

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:37,230
All right.

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,190
Now we have two images one
eighth the original size.

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,980
Let's view the down sampled image.

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,220
Magnify to the original size.

15
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,940
And let's compare that
with the other image.

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,870
Implement the two functions and
compare the results.

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:55,950
You know what they look like.
