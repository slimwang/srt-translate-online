00:00:00,792 --> 00:00:02,630
I'm going to show you
what we came up with.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,880
But this isn't necessarily,
the right answer.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,040
Remember, this an art,
it's not a science.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,740
And either way, I'm not going to
give you the whole answer.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,070
I'm leaving a few tweaks for
you to make,

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,480
and you'll be working on this site
again, at the end of the next lesson.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,420
Looking at the new site,
there are a number of major changes.

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,715
Let's go ahead and start small.

9
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:26,470
First off, the Nav buttons that
were right here above the hero,

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:31,410
have been shifted off-canvas,
into the Hamburger button menu.

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,740
The Hamburger button, is the one
with the three horizontal lines.

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,560
And now we've got our Nav-Links,
over here on the side.

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,900
This is a nice way of retrieving
a little bit of screen real estate.

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,820
Also, the header text, is a little bit
smaller to match this smaller viewport.

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,820
The first breakpoint
comes in a 550 pixels.

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,830
See how the elements reflowed and
change their location on the screen.

17
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,090
The weather is now here, in this second
position, the hero is only taking up

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,460
about 60% of the viewport width,
while the weather has the other 40%.

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,340
Also, the Nav button showed back up.

20
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,990
To see how it's done,
I've opened up Sublime Text.

21
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,360
You can see some breakpoints, like this
one using min-width 550 pixels and

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,520
this one using min-width 700 pixels.

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,770
And these breakpoints
include changes to order and

24
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,720
widths of different elements on
the screen, like hero and weather.

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,660
Break points like these, make it
really easy to change the width and

26
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,640
order of elements and
totally change and shift the layout.

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,140
The next break point comes
in at 700 pixels across.

28
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,890
The layout's changed a bit.

29
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,550
Top news is moved up here.

30
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:43,590
And we've got 50% on the Top news side,
and 50% for the hero image.

31
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,120
And the weather is now, down below.

32
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,050
At even larger widths,

33
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,290
eventually the main section of the page,
keeps to a fixed width.

34
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,890
This was accomplished with a breakpoint
that set the width to 850 pixels,

35
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,540
once the page's view port is as large or
larger than 850 pixels.

36
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,490
I've also the shifted the scores and
the weather.

37
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,700
The scores are taking up 60% of
the screen and the weather's got 40%.

38
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:13,340
The design that you see here, takes
advantage of a mostly fluid design,

39
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,630
with a little bit of layout shifting,
I think the hometown site is

40
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,140
actually looking pretty good right now,
but it's definitely not perfect.

41
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,280
Let's look at the weather real quick.

42
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,540
On this view, the weather looks like so,
with this cute little icon right here

43
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,030
and then the actual
temperature right next to it.

44
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,570
But if you resize the screen
just a little bit.

45
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,990
The temperature drops down
to the line below it and

46
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,810
that's actually kind of gross.

47
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,360
I don't like that.

48
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,950
I also think that something better
could be done with the hero image.

49
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,570
Watch the edge of it
as the screen resizes.

50
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,170
See how the edge actually changes?

51
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,850
That's because right now, CSS is being
used to set an positioned image.

52
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,000
Background size cover,

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,500
will scale up the image to make
sure it covers the entire div.

54
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,440
I think there could
be a better solution.

55
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,380
What do you think?

56
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,810
In the next lesson, you'll get
a chance to finish the site and

57
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,070
make even more improvements.
