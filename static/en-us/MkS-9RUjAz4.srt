00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,525
We've talked a lot about working with numbers, how to compute with them, how to

2
00:00:03,525 --> 00:00:08,205
read them, how to display them, and you're written quite a few programs. But

3
00:00:08,205 --> 00:00:12,365
there's one important point that I'd like to talk about for a few minutes, and

4
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:18,490
that is, first do things by hand before you open the programming environment.

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,390
The natural urge of every programmer is to go ahead and open BlueJ, or whatever

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:28,050
environment you're using, and start typing code. But that's rarely productive.

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,764
Let me give you an example problem, and show you how I would work it out by

8
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:36,240
hand. So, here's the problem. We're supposed to be putting tiles white and red

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,570
ones alternating along a wall, and we are told the total width of the wall. We

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,213
are also told the tile size. The architect tells us, we are suppose to start

11
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:51,233
and end with the tile of the same color, and the question is how many tiles

12
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:57,293
does one need to order? It's pretty clear that you need one more white tile

13
00:00:57,293 --> 00:01:02,636
than the red tiles. But how many clearly depends on the size of the tiles and

14
00:01:02,636 --> 00:01:07,547
the total width of the wall. So, let's say that your assignment is to write a

15
00:01:07,547 --> 00:01:13,040
computer program that helps the builder with this problem. Like I said, this is

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,003
not the time to open your coding environment. Instead, do a couple of these by

17
00:01:18,003 --> 00:01:21,879
hand first so you get a feel for what the computations really are.
