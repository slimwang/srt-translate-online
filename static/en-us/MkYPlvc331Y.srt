00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,840
Time for a question for you. In this question

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,910
I'm asking you, to give a couple of examples, of

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,220
how downloading code, mechanism may be used by a library

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,160
operating system. I already, explained to you the concept of

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,500
this mechanism. The concept of this mechanism is of

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,340
course the fact that a library operating system can say

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,630
well here there's a piece of code. That I want

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,270
you to run on my behalf, and present it to

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,580
exokernel, so that it is now part of exokernel. Sort of increasing the code

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,500
base of exokernel by the downloaded code

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,820
on behalf of that particular guest operating system.

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,580
So this question is asking you to give a couple of examples. Of how

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,110
you envision a library operating system may

14
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,200
use this core downloading facility, provided by Exokernel.
