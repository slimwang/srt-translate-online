1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,400
So, now, let's spend a little bit of
time trying to get an intuition of what

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,400
this M matrix is.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,040
So, the best way to think about what
an image moment is, an image moment is

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,440
a particularly weighted average
of image pixel intensities,

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,840
and it could also be a function of those
intensities, and it's used to basically

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,120
give us certain specific property
at a point within an image.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,460
So, any image, shown by this rectangle
here, at any point I want to be able to

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,670
find some properties that
are kind of descriptive and

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,230
something I can actually
find about an image.

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,580
Now of course, what we will leverage
here is information driven by

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,720
the derivatives at that point.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,890
So the derivatives, of course,

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,240
can be measured using various types of
things we've looked at and from that,

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,320
I can find a gradient vector, the
magnitude of that, and the direction.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,850
The second moment matrix is
specifically a matrix derived from

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,480
the gradient of this function that
could be actually at this point.

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,950
And it summarizes the predominant
directions of the gradient

18
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,092
of a specified neighborhood
of that point.

19
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:04,540
So around that point, basically now,

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,350
gives you more information about
the direction and the magnitude.

21
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,140
One additional thing that's important
about the second moment matrix

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,570
is it also gives you a little bit more
information about the coherency of

23
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,910
the directions in that neighborhood.

24
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,090
So let's look at the equation of how we
would compute the second moment matrix.

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,070
Basically again, it is the intensities,
sorry, the derivative of

26
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,440
the intensities in X and Y direction,
and then the mixtures of these X and Y's

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,320
on the diagonals or off-diagonals, and
computed over any neighborhood point.

28
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,040
And of course the neighborhood
search is this region here.

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,790
So again, simply put, if I had
an image like this basically I can use

30
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,770
a second Loman matrix to at any point in
the neighborhood around that point find

31
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,730
description using the gradients that
is unique to this point, and actually I

32
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,580
want to use this to understand more
about what's happening in the region and

33
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,590
that could be used to now compute the
information about if there's a corner

34
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,160
and what kinds of parameters associated
with that corner in that image.

35
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,370
Think the note of course is,
and we've talked about this,

36
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,620
is the importance of the ellipse and
the argon values.

37
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,750
Again, something that
we've looked at before.

38
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,750
Of course, when you have certain bits
of information, and again, if you think

39
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,700
about it this way, with the moments it's
kind of giving you information what's

40
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,300
the best possible rotation
around these two different axes.

41
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,870
And, of course,
we use this to define two major axes.

42
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,310
Or, sorry, one, for
this ellipse a minor and the major axes.

43
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,490
And this kind of gives us what's the
most dominant direction for this region.

44
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,980
And that's what we're interested in
here, is at any point in an image,

45
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,320
finding these types of ellipsoids, and

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,880
using these ellipsoids to
find the dominant directions.

47
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,240
And, of course, recall that item values
provide us with this information.
