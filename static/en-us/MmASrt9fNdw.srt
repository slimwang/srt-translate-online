1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,870
Databases must store sensitive data,

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:07,280
and there must be something different
about securing data that is stored in

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,700
a database compared to what
we've been talking about before.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,850
So what we discussed before is
data stored in files, for example.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,190
When we did access control we said you
have read/write permissions on files.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,090
Databases we're going to
discuss are somewhat different.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:27,840
They also store data, but
it's different and the fact that they

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,200
store lots of data that is sensitive,
that's what makes this topic important.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,680
So databases actually do store
massive amounts of sensitive data.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,530
This could be, if you are a company,
could be your customer data.

11
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:46,630
In fact, when we talk about some company
getting hacked and large amounts

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:51,510
of their customer data, such as social
security number, or date of birth, or

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,640
address, credit card numbers,
when those are being stolen by hackers,

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,640
databases store data that we can see
needs to be accessed in a certain way.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,310
And the reason we're able to
do that is because databases

16
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,260
can store what is called
data in a structured form.

17
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,510
And the kind of examples that I just
talked about, the data that we have

18
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,770
about customer records or health
records, that data does have structure,

19
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,500
and the structure actually influences
how it's going to get accessed.

20
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,310
So, I may ask, for example, information
about all customers who purchased some

21
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,630
number of things in the last two months.

22
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,430
Asking this kind of a query or
formulating this king of a query or

23
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,770
a question That we want to
run against the database,

24
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,350
we make use of the structure that
is there in this data to do that.

25
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:50,020
So, it really do is that think about
a database storing structure data and

26
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,040
then we can basically access it through

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,740
programs called queries
that we submit to it.

28
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,100
These programs are queries written
in a language that is designed for

29
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,120
accessing data stored in databases.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,600
One common one is SQL, which stands for
Structured Query Language.

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,660
So we're going to talk about accessing
data from databases using SQL

32
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,400
quite a bit.

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,170
This is another thing that is
different about databases.

34
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:20,120
Databases also store data that
is persistent, like files.

35
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,210
And of course we need
integrity of the data.

36
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,110
One way to do that is we
have this transactional

37
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,970
nature of queries of programs
that we run on the database.

38
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,140
A transaction means either
the program runs completely,

39
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,830
does everything it's supposed to do,
or whatever it did gets undone.

40
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,250
Transaction either,
we have the zero or one property,

41
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,290
either it's done completely or
not done at all kind of a thing.

42
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,835
By running a partial transaction,
for example,

43
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:52,050
a query could leave the database in
a state where it is not consistent and

44
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,650
that impacts the integrity.

45
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,700
Finally database is another thing that's
kind of different about them is that

46
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,460
we can create a virtual database,
what is called a database view.

47
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,860
This is really derived data
that's there in the database.

48
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,800
So for example, you may want to choose a
subset of the information that's stored

49
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,640
in the database.

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,570
So you can run a query against
the database, and the result

51
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,750
could be another sort of virtual
database, also called a database view.

52
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,540
And then users can have
access to that view.
