00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,399
Now that we have our Data Prep to be
used in a Clustering Process, and

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,000
we have an idea of which Variables and
Principle Components we might want to

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,719
incorporate, it's time to start looking
at the actual clustering process itself.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,730
That's what we'll focus on
throughout this lesson.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,629
Now, there are at least a few different
methods that have been developed in

6
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:24,910
recent years, that will divide a number
of objects into relatively homogeneous,

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,589
or similar segments or clusters.

8
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:30,809
They primarily fall into
two types of methods.

9
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:35,210
One is called a Hierarchical method, and
the other is called a K-Centroid method.

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,770
I will go over the high level
characteristics of both of these,

11
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,000
as well as some of the differences.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,359
Later in the lesson, we will look in
detail at the K-Centroid method, for

13
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,579
our hands on exercise.
