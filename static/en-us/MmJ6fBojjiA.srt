1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,230
You have just seen how to add context and

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,010
narrative to your data through the process of visualization.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,300
We've also seen how journalists traditionally do this.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,170
And how data journalism reimagines this process.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,040
>> You also learned how important it is to verify and validate your data.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,880
You learned a little bit about the different types of biases that can exist,

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,720
such as data bias, author bias and reader bias.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,680
>> Now that we're comfortable with different types of narrative

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,540
structures within visualizations, let's see how we can apply these to our own.

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,570
We'll use interaction and

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,260
animation to add a new depth of field to our particular visualization.

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,710
In this case, the World Cup example.
