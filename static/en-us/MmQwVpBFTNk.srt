00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,540
Here in viewDidLoad, we're going to
add the target action to our button.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,940
And here you can see the three key
components of the target action.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,800
The target, which is self,
the method to use,

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,240
which is incrementCount, and the control
event, which is TouchUpInside.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,340
And with the action added to our object
model, our click counter should work.

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,940
So let's check it out.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,910
All right.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,790
Very nice.
