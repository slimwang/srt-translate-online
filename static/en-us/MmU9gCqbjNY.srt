1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's trace what happens as we see a little more of the input.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's say we actually walk over and we see the 2.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Well, then our parcing state looks like this--E goes to 2.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We've seen the 2, and there's nothing left.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Everything important is in the past.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There's nothing in the future.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So conceptually, we can use this rule--this rewrite rule, E goes to 2

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
like we hinted at here with our purple text, we will also be here.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
E goes to E + E, but we've already seen the E, the +, and the E--

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
E + E.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So we can go even further and go back to the first rule in our grammar

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
where we were trying to parse a sentence, which could be an expression.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We've already seen an entire expression--1 + 2--and now we're done.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In fact, if you can get to the state corresponding to your starting nonterminal

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
being completely finished, everything is in the past. Nothing to see in the future.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Then you've parsed it! That string was in the language of the grammar.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So formally a parsing state, a possible configuration of a parser, a world we could be in

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
is a rewrite rule from the grammar augmented with exactly 1 red dot--

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
that's where I'm putting my finger. That's where we are now. The past comes before it.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The future comes after it--on the right-hand side of the rule.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You can never put the dot on the left. The dot is always to the right.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now for any given input as we've seen here, you could actually be in maybe 3 of these

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
parsing states at once.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
One way of looking at the world is that I just finished seeing the 2.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Another way of looking at the world is--actually I'm done with everything.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Those can all be true at the same time.
