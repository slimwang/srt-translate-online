00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,770
For children experience is based on a single feature. For example height, not

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,828
necessarily height, weight, length, altogether. Children can't conserve,

3
00:00:09,828 --> 00:00:13,604
meaning they don't release even if the shape changes, the volume the size and

4
00:00:13,604 --> 00:00:19,430
the amount can stay the same. The classic example here is liquid. If one takes

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,021
two identical glasses and pour the exact same amount of liquid in each, then

6
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:27,000
ask them which one has more liquid. They're going to tell you they have the

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,858
same amount. But, if you take a short, fat glass like this and have them pour

8
00:00:30,858 --> 00:00:34,638
it onto a tall, thin glass like this, and then ask them which one has more,

9
00:00:34,638 --> 00:00:41,640
they're going to tell you that the tall, thin glass has more of the liquid.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,534
Because the liquid comes up higher. This is a perfect example of them only

11
00:00:45,534 --> 00:00:50,042
focusing on one feature, height. Older children and adults know that what we

12
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:53,760
gain in height, we lose in width. So, it's the exact same amount of liquid,

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,029
they're conserved. But younger children usually under the age of six, can't do

14
00:00:58,029 --> 00:01:01,330
this mental calculation. They can be fooled by appearance.
