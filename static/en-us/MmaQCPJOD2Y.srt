00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,015
Sperman's theory of intelligence address the question how intelligent are you?

2
00:00:05,015 --> 00:00:10,250
And the evidence for this theory is fairly strong. Sperman found that the

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:16,680
correlations across the three domains were about positive .6 and .7. Now this

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,620
is on a correlation scale between negative 1 and positive 1. And because it's

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,060
positive, the 2 scores will go in the same direction. So as one score

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,340
increases, so does the other score. Still to this day modern tests of

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,760
intelligence show that the 3 primary domains of intelligence are positively

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,210
correlated. Supporting the view that intelligence is one general ability. Now

9
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,200
it's important to remember That theories drive scientific research. A theory

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,790
doesn't necessarily mean it's a law, regardless of how strong the correlations

11
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,340
are. Theories can change and be adapted over time. The theory that intelligence

12
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,190
is one, basic set of related skills is known as the g-factor theory of

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,960
intelligence. This is the foundation for the idea that intelligence Can be

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,200
represented by a single number. This theory organizes intelligence into a

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,530
hierarchy. With general intelligence. Or g at the top. And from there extends

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:17,678
three specific domains. Your spatial abilities. Your mathematical abilities.

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,150
And your verbal abilities. Until recently, all of the major tests of

18
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,730
intelligent, has been based on Sprimen's theory.
