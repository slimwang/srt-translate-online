00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,840
So, file has a write method which writes to a file and we can pass in a string.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,171
So, that will write the line import this, to the file wim.py in the current

3
00:00:09,171 --> 00:00:13,230
directory. When we're done with the file, we should always remember to close it.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,640
And the reason we want to close files is operating systems do lots of strange

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,084
things with files to try to maintain them, to buffer them. The changes that we

6
00:00:20,084 --> 00:00:23,317
think we made with our program might not actually be there if we don't close it.

7
00:00:23,318 --> 00:00:26,850
It also might cause problems if there are open file handles left that weren't

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,912
closed when the program executed. So, we should close the file after we're done

9
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:34,208
with it. So now we'll have a quiz to see if you can think about all the things

10
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:38,205
that could possible go wrong with this code. The choices are, the call to open

11
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:43,005
fails if the current directory is not writable, the call to write fails if the

12
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:47,730
disk is full, a cosmic ray hits the processor at the wrong time, changing the

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,305
string from import this to import thus, there's a power outage before the

14
00:00:52,305 --> 00:00:57,899
fout.close completes, leaving the file in a corrupted state. Check all of the

15
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,733
ones that could possibly go wrong.
