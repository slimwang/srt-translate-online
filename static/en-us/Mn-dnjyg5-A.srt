00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,390
The first way I'm going to try to do this is to start with the coordinates of

2
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:08,765
this point. So, I have this y value, 10 minus the y value of this point, which

3
00:00:08,777 --> 00:00:13,255
is 2, and I divide that by the x value of the top point minus the x value of the

4
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:17,595
lower point. Simplifying, just gives me 2. Now, let's try starting with the

5
00:00:17,607 --> 00:00:22,674
coordinates from the lower point first. We'll take that y value, 2, and subtract

6
00:00:22,686 --> 00:00:27,383
10, and switch the coordinates in the denominator as well. So, we have 3 minus

7
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:32,159
7. Now, instead of positive 8 over positive 4, we have negative 8 over negative

8
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:36,790
4. But in the end, this reduces to the same answer of 2. So, we can see that it

9
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:41,127
doesn't matter which points coordinates we put first, as long as we're

10
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:41,832
consistent.
