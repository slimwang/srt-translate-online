1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,350
So here we are. Back to our overarching design.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,280
And you'll notice that, thus far we've created just the

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,420
one instance of our class movie. And that instance

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,180
is, Toy Story. The next thing for us to do,

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,800
is create another instance of class movie. And this

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,290
time we're going to create,Avatar. So, to do that, I

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,700
am back here at my code. Here's the code

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,520
for the class movie. And, here is my entertainment_center.py filewhich,

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,740
is where I'm creating my first instance, Toy Story.

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,050
Now, you may have noticed that I've reduced the font

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,940
size of my code, this is so I can squeeze

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,520
all of the code, in one video frame so you

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,350
can see it properly. Next, I will create the

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,410
instance called avatar, by calling media.Movie. The first piece of

15
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,580
information I have to supply, is the name of the

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,650
movie, which is Avatar. Next is its storyline, which is,

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:57,390
a marine on an alien planet. That is followed by, Avatar's movie poster,

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,630
which I will paste here. And the final piece of information is, Avatar's YouTube

19
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,672
trailer, which I will also copy in. All right. So, here is our new

20
00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:09,520
instance, Avatar. Let's print out it's storyline

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,655
next. So I will say, print avatar.storyline.

22
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:19,650
[SOUND] There it is. I'm also going to comment out

23
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,460
my previous print statement, which was printing out twice toy

24
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,420
story, story line. So, there it is, let me go

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,470
ahead and save this file. Now before I go ahead and

26
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,500
run this program, let me ask you a question. What

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,740
do you think, will be the output of this line

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,430
of code right here? Now I know that the font

29
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,730
of this code is really difficult to read. So what I'm

30
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,130
going to do, is make it a little bit bigger. So here it is,

31
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,540
the code in a bigger font size. Here is where we are creating the

32
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,550
instance avatar, and here we're trying to print it story line. So, what do

33
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,670
you think will be the output of

34
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,440
the following code? Here are some answer choices.
