00:00:02,134 --> 00:00:02,950
>> Whoa.

00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,248
>> That is the sound of great design.

4
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:08,291
That sound was made possible by electrical engineers,

5
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:11,658
mechanical engineers, and even audio engineers, that came

6
00:00:11,658 --> 00:00:14,386
together to engineer the perfect sound of speed.

7
00:00:14,386 --> 00:00:15,470
>> Nice.

8
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,140

11
00:00:19,088 --> 00:00:24,247
>> Yes. [SOUND] This

12
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:30,014
is user experience.
