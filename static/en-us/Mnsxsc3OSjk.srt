00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,634
We just found out that the opposite sides of our quadrilateral in black here,

2
00:00:04,646 --> 00:00:09,110
are the same length. MN is equal to PQ and NP is equal to QM. But is there

3
00:00:09,122 --> 00:00:13,744
anything else that is special about this black shape? You may remember from

4
00:00:13,756 --> 00:00:18,693
Geometry that any quadrilateral whose opposite sides are equal to one another is

5
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:23,574
called a parallelogram. So, the opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent

6
00:00:23,586 --> 00:00:28,790
to one another or of equal length, but they are also something else. They are

7
00:00:28,802 --> 00:00:32,885
parallel to one another. But how can we tell they're parallel, mathematically?

8
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,997
And what does being parallel really mean? That's what we're going to look at

9
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:37,254
next.
