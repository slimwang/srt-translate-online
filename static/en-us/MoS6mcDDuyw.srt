>> All we need to do to get rid of the 300 on the left is subtract it from both

2
00:00:04,884 --> 00:00:09,592
sides. Then we have 0 equals x squared plus 25x minus 150. So, here's an

3
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:14,647
equation. We want to solve for x. Let's take a couple minutes to figure out how

4
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,248
we can actually do that.
