1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,040
Okay so by way of wrapping up on this
let me just point out three quick facts

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,450
about correlated equilibrium.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,022
>> Cool.
>> Okay, so here's the first one,

4
00:00:09,022 --> 00:00:11,258
correlated equilibria or C.E.

5
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:15,070
as a cool kids call them can
be found in poly of the time.

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,460
So this is a good thing
even though I didn't

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,210
tell you how I found the one third,
one third,

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,400
one third, zero correlated
equilibrium in the previous example.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,850
You can find that in
a reasonable amount of time.

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,580
I found it in even more
reasonable amount of time,

11
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,825
which is I looked at the example and
I wrote down the numbers.

12
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:32,610
>> [LAUGH]
>> Which is also polynomial.

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,790
Okay, in fact it's linear.

14
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,340
Okay, so.
>> And that's not so

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,230
true of Nash equilibria,
that Nash equilibria are hard to find.

16
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,391
>> Yes, they are which is unfortunate.

17
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:44,218
>> No but it, okay, it gets a nice
advantage of correlated equilibrium.

18
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:46,650
>> That's true but Nash sounds so cool.

19
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,410
Well in any case.

20
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,890
Okay, the second fact is all mixed Nash
equilibria are in fact correlated.

21
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,923
So this means that correlated
equilibiria exist.

22
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:55,850
That comes from what we discussed or

23
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,480
that there's always at least
a possibly mixed Nash equilibria.

24
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,030
>> Cool.

25
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,890
>> And of course pure Nash equilibria
are themselves mixed Nash equilibria.

26
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,860
Therefore correlated equilibria exist.

27
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,860
>> Gotcha.
>> Okay.

28
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,500
Finally.

29
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,230
>> Wait, pure in the sense of
the original definition of.

30
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:11,810
>> Right exactly.

31
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,500
>> Okay.
>> And

32
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,540
then the third one is, and
this kind of follows from probability,

33
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,431
all convex combinations of mixed Nash
equilibria are in fact correlated.

34
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:21,600
>> Whoa, okay.

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,880
>> There's a lot there and
we could talk about it forever but

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,350
the basic idea is that correlated
equilibria is kind of cool traffic

37
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:32,910
lights are not a bad idea and coming
up with them isn't impossibly hard.

38
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,510
Unlike all that other stuff you
talked about before with POMDPs

39
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,430
where there are undecidable and
life is terrible

40
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,970
at least here we can actually find
pretty good correlated equilibrium.

41
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,080
Or at least we can find
correlated equilibrium.

42
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,950
>> That's a relief.

43
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,940
>> It is a relief.

44
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,330
>> Okay, so I think I'm ready
to go on to the next thing.
