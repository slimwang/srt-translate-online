00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,648
To shift our graph to the right by 3, we need to replace x in the original

2
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:08,904
equation for the original graph, with x minus 3. So we end up with f of x

3
00:00:08,904 --> 00:00:13,798
equals the quantity x minus 3, squared. Now you also could of course write y

4
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:16,248
equals the quantity x minus 3 squared.
