00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What I want you to think about is, imagine that we've got a graph with n nodes and m edges,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and we're going to try to find out whether it's colorable well with k colors

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
by turning it into a big formula like the one I just showed you.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I want to know how many clauses are in the formula, and just to make that a bit more concrete

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
a clause is the sort of thing that I got here in parenthesis, it's between the n's.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We have a list of things that are combined and then there's an n and then there's more things

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that are combined and an n, so how many things are being ended together in the formula.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So I want you to figure out an actual expression in terms of k, n and m that will tell you the answer,

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but I'll actually ask you to do it for just a concrete example.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So imagine we've got 3 colors, 8 nodes and 20 edges, how many clauses are in the formula

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
that result from converting this 3 colorability problem into a satisfiability problem,

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and when you have your answer, write it in this box and we'll check it for you.
