00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,310
In previous exercises,
we added in the JumpState

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,640
to determine when GigaGal is up
in the air versus on the ground.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,470
We added the Facing state to determine
whether we should display the left or

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,160
the right facing sprite.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,900
So, now let's add in WalkState to
determine when GigaGal is just standing

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,430
versus walking.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,600
Then we'll make sure we're
updating the WalkState properly.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,230
Then we'll add into our giant
if-else block in Render.

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,660
Then we'll add the walking sprites into
our giant if else block in Render.

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,590
I know this is getting pretty ugly and
you might be thinking,

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,960
shouldn't we be doing this
with switch statements?

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,395
Well, you can do it with three nested
switch statements if you really want to.

13
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:38,870
I think this is a little bit cleaner.

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,120
The result is a Gigagal that stands,
jumps, and walks.

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,040
Follow the to dos in the course code.

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,950
To load up the walking sprite,
create the walk state enumeration, and

17
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,390
display the proper sprites with Gigagal
is walking versus standing or jumping.
