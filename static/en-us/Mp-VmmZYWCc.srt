Welcome back to Introduction of Computer Vision.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,770
Today we're going to wrap up our unit on essentially calibration and

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,730
stereo and we're going to talk about the fundamental matrix.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,100
Last time, we developed the relationship between two views of two calibrated

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,840
cameras where I actually knew the rotation and translation between them.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,110
And what was cool is we derived, we essentially went with what the geometric

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,620
constraint was that whole epi-polar constraint that we had shown very early on.

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,460
And we derived from the geometric constraint, an algebraic constraint.

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,590
And in particular we defined something called the essential matrix which related

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,970
between two views or I should say, world points of two calibrated cameras.

11
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,030
So the same point in the scene, the two different views of it,

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,590
what the relationship was between them.

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,322
But you might ask, suppose I don't have a calibrated camera.

14
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:57,090
All right, well look, let's think about the intuition.

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,550
If you gave me two images, and

16
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:04,290
you gave me enough points to tell me that this point is this one,

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,580
this one, this one, this one, gave me enough corresponding pairs.

18
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,720
It feels like you should be able to figure out,

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,170
say the epipolar lines, that is how the, how the lines map across and

20
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,730
what the, what the correspondence should be for all the other points.

21
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,910
When I say correspondence, where,

22
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,370
where they can be along the epipolar line depending upon their depth.

23
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,650
Well, today what we're going to do is we're going to make that intuition real.

24
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,795
We'll, we'll do the mathematics of this relationship between two

25
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:28,840
uncalibrated points.
