00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,260
Now try the same thing for this scenario. Matthew forgot his bus pass at home,

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,116
and when he was about to get on the bus, he realized this. He became very

3
00:00:09,116 --> 00:00:13,755
upset, and this caused a negative emotional reaction. While walking to school,

4
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:17,451
instead of riding the bus, he thought more carefully about the situation. And

5
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:21,964
realized that at he least he didn't lose the bus pass, it was safely at home.

6
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:25,844
So, he didn't have to spend money to replace it. Also, he realized that it was

7
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:30,364
good to get outside and enjoy some exercise on his walk to school. Identify the

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,658
part of this scenario that was a primary appraisal and the part there was a

9
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,980
secondary appraisal. Type your responses in these two boxes.
