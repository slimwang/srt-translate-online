1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,340
When you need new software,
what do you typically do?

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,780
You might visit an app store
like this and download it or

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,080
you could actually walk into a store and
buy a physical copy.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,560
You have a lot of different options.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,880
You might even say you
have a list of options.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,940
Now how often have you seen software for
Linux sitting up on a store shelf?

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,700
Not very often, if at all.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,460
But we still have a list of various
places we can go to get software.

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,730
This is called a package source list.

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:26,310
Let's take a look.

11
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,345
All of your available package
sources are listed in this file

12
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:33,830
/etc/app/sources.list.

13
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,890
Remember when we were
discussing distributions,

14
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,310
we said each one approves and
releases packages in their own way and

15
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,049
that's one of the big ways
in which they differ.

16
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,200
This is the package's list for
your current version of Ubuntu.

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,220
As you skim through the file, you'll
see some pretty recognizable parts.

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,720
We see a URL here and
the word trusty looks familiar.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,930
That's the code name for
the version of Ubuntu we're running.

20
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,150
We know Ubuntu is also
based off of Debian, so

21
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,920
that's probably what this deb stands for
here.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,600
This is a list of software repositories
that Ubuntu set up for us automatically.

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,200
There are a lot in this list and
each of these would be referenced

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,140
when you try to update or
install new software.

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,610
Speaking of which, let's go ahead and

26
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,530
make sure that all of our
software is up to date.
