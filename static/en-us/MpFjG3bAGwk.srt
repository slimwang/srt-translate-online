1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,400
So, Michael wants us to do a quiz.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,830
Because Michael likes quizzes cause he thinks you like

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,010
quizzes. And so, I want you to answer

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,790
this question before Michael gets a chance to. So

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:16,149
just to be clear here's the question again. What happens to the distribution

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:21,380
over a particular example i when the hypothesis ht that was output by the

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,700
example. Agrees with the particular label, Y-sub-i.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,150
Okay, so we have four possibilities when they agree.

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,070
One is the probability of you seeing that particular

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,065
example increases. That is, you increase the value of

11
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:38,730
D-sub-t on i. Or the probability of you seeing that

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,950
example decreases. That is, the number d of t

13
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,640
of i goes down, or it stays the same

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,380
when they agree or well it depends on exactly

15
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,190
what's going on with the old value of d and

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,870
alpha and all these other things. So ,you can't

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,230
really give just one of those other three answers.

18
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,474
So those are your possibilites. The other radio buttons

19
00:00:59,474 --> 00:01:02,470
[LAUGH] only one of them is right. And go.
