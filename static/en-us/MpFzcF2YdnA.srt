The graph of any function of the form f of x equals log base a of x is

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:11,242
continually increasing on the domain 0 to infinity. And it has a range from

3
00:00:11,242 --> 00:00:17,555
negative infinity to infinity. It has a vertical asymptote of x equals 0, the y

4
00:00:17,555 --> 00:00:21,951
axis. And it passes through the point 1,0.
