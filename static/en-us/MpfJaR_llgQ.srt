1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And our second question comes from Hardy Martinez.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
He wants to know if the rules and format for regular expression

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that we're learning now--if they extend to other languages beyond Python,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
or if they are Python specific.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In general, they use almost all the same notation,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and that's partly because down underneath all the APIs that you see,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
all the functions that you are calling,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
they're using almost the same code.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's based on some--someone wrote it way back, and it seemed to work well,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
so people reuse it.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There are some differences, depending on

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the language you're using and the library you're using,

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and that's just something you look up in the documentation.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Python, for example, has a lot of documentation on what the symbols mean and whatnot.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Sometimes they'll vary, especially when you're getting to

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
the more obscure syntax features of regular expressions,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
which we don't cover in that class.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Pretty much everything we talk about here is going to be the same throughout.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay, so students that learn this will not be behind

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
when they try to implement regular expressions?

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah, and what matters is you know what the tools are.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The specific character that means something,

23
00:00:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
it doesn't make that much of a difference.
