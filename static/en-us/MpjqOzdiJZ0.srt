00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,160
This brings us to the end
of our foundations lesson.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,270
Our goal here has been to
give you a solid basis for

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,160
studying machine learning.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,140
You now know where machine
learning came from and

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,070
where it sits in the broader
family of artificial intelligence.

6
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,800
You now know the three major types of
machine learning that we'll cover,

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,340
supervised, unsupervised,
and reinforcement learning.

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,030
You now know some of the applications of
machine learning like robotics, trading,

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,020
and health care, and finally, you now
know some of the basics behind model

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,610
building and machine learning,
like classification and regression.

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,759
Next, we'll move on to model
building in more detail.

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,870
I hope you're excited to get started.
