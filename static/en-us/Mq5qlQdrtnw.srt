00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,785
An equation is in slope-intercept form if we can write it as something like y

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:09,690
equals mx plus b, where m is the slope, which conveniently we already have for

3
00:00:09,702 --> 00:00:14,710
our equation, and b is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept. Since we have slots

4
00:00:14,722 --> 00:00:19,660
for x and y in our equations and we conveniently already have two points that we

5
00:00:19,672 --> 00:00:24,667
know can belong in those two spots, we can use either of these points and plug

6
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:29,449
it into the slots for x and y. So we can start off with what we already know,

7
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:34,450
using the slope. I am going to use this point, 100,1200 and plug 100 in for x

8
00:00:34,462 --> 00:00:39,645
and 1200 in for y. That's because we know that this point, or the coordinates of

9
00:00:39,657 --> 00:00:44,804
this point, when substituted into the proper places in this equation, satisfy

10
00:00:44,816 --> 00:00:49,358
this equation, or make it a true statement. That means we're allowed to use

11
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,121
them. I still don't know what the y coordinate of our y intercept is, so I would

12
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:58,725
really like to figure that out with the equation. So I want to get b by itself

13
00:00:58,737 --> 00:01:03,245
on one side of the equation, and I end up with 700 equals b. Now you can take

14
00:01:03,257 --> 00:01:08,154
this value and put it back in the equation we started with. That gives us a

15
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:13,465
final equation of y equals 5 x plus 700. So this is our answer. You could have

16
00:01:13,477 --> 00:01:18,829
of course used the point 60, 1000 instead of 100,1200. And we can check to see

17
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:24,453
this is right by plugging in each of the coordinates for the 2 points to it. And

18
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:29,575
seeing if each side ends up equaling the other side.
