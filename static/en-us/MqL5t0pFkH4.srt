The HTML spec says that unrecognized input types are to be

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,600
treated as text. So, new input types will still work even if

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,490
they're not supported on a particular browser. They'll just function like text

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,520
inputs. Not quite as useful, but still functional. Graceful degradation at work.
