00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
60 angular degrees is about 1 radian.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
That's easy to remember once you get used to it.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
But remember, it's ABOUT 1 radian.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's not precisely 1 radian.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
360° is 2π. 2π is 6.28 something.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
60° is a 6th part of it, a 6th part of 6-point something is 1.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And now we can work backwards.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If 1 radian is 60°, then 0.1 radian should be 6°.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And this requires the use of a calculator, I guess.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The ratio of this leg to the hypotenuse is the sine of 40°,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
so what we are needing is the ratio of this leg

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
to this hypotenuse is the sine of 40°.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The number that we are looking for would fulfill the following:

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that number divided by 10 is the sine of 40°,

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
which means multiply both sides by 10.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We need the sine of 40° multiplied by 10, which is about 6.4.
