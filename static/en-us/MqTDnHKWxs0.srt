1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,620
Now that we know our value of e, or at least many digits of it. Though, not

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,812
nearly an infinite number of them. We can see how those numbers we had on our

3
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:13,195
table, introducing us to the idea of continually compounding interest.

4
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:18,194
Definitly do approach this value. There we're getting closer and closer to it

5
00:00:18,194 --> 00:00:23,678
as we moved on the list as n got bigger. And in fact, the formula for

6
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:28,002
calculating continuously compounded interest, does involve E. Here it is. So,

7
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:35,942
for continuously compounded interest, we have this formula. A equals p times e

8
00:00:35,942 --> 00:00:40,711
to the rt. As before, A stands for the total amount of money in the account,

9
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:46,355
after t years have passed. P is the principal amount invested in the account.

10
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:53,504
And r is the annual interest rate. Remember, e is not a variable. It's that

11
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:57,286
very special number we've just discussed. What if we kept Grant's situation

12
00:00:57,286 --> 00:01:02,862
exactly the same as before. A principal of $20,000 and annual interest rate of

13
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:09,788
4%, but this time we let the interest compound continuously. How much money

14
00:01:09,788 --> 00:01:15,675
would he have after five years then? Don't forget to use our new equation And

15
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:18,913
please round to two decimal places.
