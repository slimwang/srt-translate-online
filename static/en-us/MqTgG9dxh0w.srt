1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,900
So let's look at our first function, f of x equals 2x plus 3. The domain is all

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:11,974
real numbers, as is the range. And, this function is neither even nor odd.

3
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:17,661
Let's look at our second function, f of x equals x squared plus 6. Our domain

4
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:22,395
is again all real numbers. Our range is y greater than or equal to 6. And this

5
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:28,277
is an even function. Lets look at f of x equals negative 2. Our domain is again

6
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:34,557
all real numbers, but our range is restricted to y is equal to negative 2. And

7
00:00:34,557 --> 00:00:40,138
this is an even function. Lets look at f of x equals x cubed minus 1. The

8
00:00:40,138 --> 00:00:46,100
domain is all real numbers, as is the range, and this is neither even nor odd.

9
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,554
Let's look at the function f of x equals the absolute value of x minus 2. The

10
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:57,369
domain is all real numbers. The range is y is greater than or equal to 0. And

11
00:00:57,369 --> 00:01:03,393
this is neither even nor an odd function. Our last function, f of x equals the

12
00:01:03,393 --> 00:01:10,230
square root of 3 x plus 2. Our domain is x is greater than or equal to 2 3rds.

13
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:16,433
Our range, y greater than or equal to 0. And again, this is neither even nor an

14
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:18,424
odd function.
