1
00:00:00,154 --> 00:00:02,326
So now I want you to write

2
00:00:02,388 --> 00:00:04,496
the computer code that accepts

3
00:00:04,496 --> 00:00:06,574
arbitrary P₀, P₁, P₂

4
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:08,148
and calculates

5
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:09,353
the resulting probability

6
00:00:09,353 --> 00:00:11,578
of a positive test result.
