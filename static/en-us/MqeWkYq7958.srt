1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,719
Now, we just measured
the error of this linear model

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:05,810
against our original training data.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,410
We know, though, from say,

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,710
k and n, that we can build models that
can fit this training data exactly.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,210
So we can have arbitrarily small
error against our training set.

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,850
The more important measure is,
what is our error out of sample?

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,240
So, what out of sample means is
we train on our training set, but

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,030
we test on a separate
testing set of data.

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,720
And, that's going to be
different than our training set.

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,650
So, to measure out of sample error, we
look at the error from our testing set,

11
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,030
not our training set.

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,020
So we look at each one of these test
points and measure the error for

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,690
each one of those.

14
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,700
So we look at these blue points
instead of the green points,

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,340
plug them into this equation
just like before, and

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,324
that's our out of sample
root mean squared error.
