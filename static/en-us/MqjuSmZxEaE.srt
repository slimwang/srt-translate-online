1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,320
All right, so let's start sort of
climbing up the visual system,

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,920
starting at the bottom,
which of course is the eye.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,130
And here is a sort of
a schematic picture of the eye.

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:15,162
And you know, lights coming in this way,
and there are a variety of structures.

5
00:00:15,162 --> 00:00:17,730
Let's see, a couple that we'll,
we will mention.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,670
So you have this lens here.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,890
Lens changes, what's in focus.

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,430
And by the way, you have what might
be thought of a spherical retina.

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,970
And so, the, in some sense,

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,759
spherical retinas are a lot easier
to deal with planar retinas.

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,270
We make, we put planar retinas
in cameras, things like that,

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,740
spherical means all the rays are sort
of the same, which is kind of nice.

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,870
The other thing to notice
on these lenses is,

14
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,200
that they're attached by
these fibers right here.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,750
And those fibers pull on the lens,
and they cause the lens to,

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,380
to deform, which changes the focus,
and that's how you focus near and far.

17
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,460
Well that's how you focus near and far.

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,610
The way I focus near and
far is I put on reading classes.

19
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,460
Why is that?

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,720
Because I'm old.

21
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,500
Well, I'm not that old, but what
happens is my eyeballs think I'm old.

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,470
In fact, sometime, right around my
40th birthday, I looked at my watch,

23
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,695
and I was trying to wonder how my watch
knew it was my 40th birthday because it

24
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,355
decided to go out of focus,
just that day.

25
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:15,685
But what happens is,
the ability of your,

26
00:01:15,685 --> 00:01:19,565
of those fibers to deform that lens,
that lens, it hardens up a bit.

27
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:22,025
And, and you lose the ability
to deform the lens as much and

28
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:23,135
you can't do near focus.

29
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:26,815
And that's why you see
those of us with less hair

30
00:01:26,815 --> 00:01:29,110
carrying around reading glasses.

31
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,250
So, the lens focuses
the light coming in,

32
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,290
goes through this center
called the pupil.

33
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,270
You have a certain amount of
adjustment of the size of the pupil to,

34
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,710
in terms of the amount of
light that's in there.

35
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,000
We'll, we'll talk about
the dynamic range in a minute.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,500
And then what happens is
the light passes through a,

37
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,820
a clear liquid,
which keeps the eye in its shape, and

38
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,280
it projects onto this back
area called the retina.

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,170
Okay.

40
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,280
And, one of the things you'll also
notice in here is that there's this

41
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,640
optic nerve, there's also a bunch
of blood vessels that come in and

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,410
feed the retina.

43
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,910
And we'll talk, in a little bit,

44
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,880
about how come it is that it comes
all the way up through here, so

45
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,630
that it actually sees the, the middle
here that is, it's not just in the back.

46
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,210
But when you look in there, what you
would see is a funny little area.

47
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,990
It's, referred to as the optic disc or
the blind spot.

48
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,600
And in fact, if you've ever
been to an ophthalmologist and

49
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,820
he looks in your eye,
what he sees is something like this.

50
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,320
All right?

51
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,730
That's assuming everything's healthy.

52
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,300
So there are all these blood vessels
that are nurturing the, the retina, and

53
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,930
then there's this area in the middle
where the blood vessels and, and

54
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,320
nerves are coming together and
that's your blind spot.
