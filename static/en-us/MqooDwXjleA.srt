00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,880
Up until now, we've really been doing really mostly image processing where

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,320
you take an image in, sum of I of x,y and you apply some function to it and

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,310
you get out a new image what I'm labelling is I prime of x,y.

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,760
And that's great and there's whole courses, in fact, entire careers.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,470
Hundreds of thousands of PhDs written on image processing.

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,020
But that's not why we're here.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,520
We're here to talk about real computer vision.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,492
In real vision you still take an image in, but what you get out is good stuff.

9
00:00:30,492 --> 00:00:32,980
All right, the whole idea is that we're putting images in and

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,810
we're getting stuff out.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,110
So what are some examples of stuff?

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,080
Well, maybe just a line.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,250
So here we have an image on the left and

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,080
some edge description of it in the middle, and

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,860
you can see a whole bunch of lines that have been found within this image.

16
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,250
Or maybe you want to find circles.

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,010
Actually it's a little hard to see, but there's a bowling ball there.

18
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,820
And the way the bowling ball was found was find all the circles in the image.

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,780
Well guess what?

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,490
There's only one circle and that's the bowling ball.

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,360
Or, here's some more circles.

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,360
Just find the coins.

23
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,230
And in fact I'll tell you that this particular picture was put

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,170
together by a TI TA of mine a huge number of years ago.

25
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,950
He's now a pretty famous researcher doing stuff on at I can't say where.

26
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,820
But this was in order to show how to do a Hough transform on circles.

27
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,650
And you might even find a good stuff as like.

28
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,630
Find me this car.

29
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,260
So you see on the,

30
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,960
on the left here just some examples of where we might locate the car.

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,080
But actually, the car is found right in the middle.

32
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,440
Actually, this is a notion of an arbitrary shape.

33
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,710
And in fact, we're going to get to how to do finding an arbitrary shape.

34
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,370
Actually not this lecture, not this lesson, not the one after it.

35
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,199
But the one after that, where we talk about a generalized Hough transform.
