00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,284
We've solved the equations with integers, now let's try something more

2
00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:06,771
difficult. Here's an equation with fractions. Let's use our knowledge of

3
00:00:06,783 --> 00:00:10,589
fractions to help us out. When solving an equation involving fractions it's best

4
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:14,152
to clear the denominators first. We can actually undo the division of these

5
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:17,996
denominators by multiplying through by the least common denominator. So, here's

6
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:21,859
your question, what is the least common denominator for these fractions? As a

7
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:27,505
hint, you don't need to worry about the 4, since the 4 is already a factor of 8.
