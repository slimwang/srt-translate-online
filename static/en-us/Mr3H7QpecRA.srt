1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And again, making use of the observation that our

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
state transition function is deterministic,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
we get 94, and the logic is the same as before.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The optimal action here is going north,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which we will succeed with the probability 1.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Therefore, we can use the value recursively from A3

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to deflect back to B3.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
97 - 3 gives us 94.
