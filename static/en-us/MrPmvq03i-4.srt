1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,289
Before, we had negative 2 is less than 2x is less than 10. To get x by itself,

2
00:00:04,289 --> 00:00:08,555
then, we just need to divide this quantity by 2. Since we want this to stay in

3
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:12,942
the same relationship to these other two quantities as it is right now. We need

4
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:17,282
to do the same thing to those quantities as well and we end with negative 1 is

5
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:22,000
less than x is less than 5. This, of course, translates into the interval

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,382
negative 1, 5. And, we can also plot it on our number line. To check, let's pick

7
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:32,607
any random value in this region. Let's say, maybe a 0, since that's readily

8
00:00:32,607 --> 00:00:37,764
available. Let's see. The absolute value of 2 times 0 minus 4 is equal to 0

9
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:43,468
minus 4. The absolute value of negative 4 is just 4 and 4 is less than 6. So,

10
00:00:43,468 --> 00:00:44,860
that value works.
