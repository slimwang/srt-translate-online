00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,293
In general, a fractional exponent represents a power devided by a root. X is

2
00:00:05,293 --> 00:00:09,145
the radicand of what's underneath the radical symbol. A is going to be the

3
00:00:09,145 --> 00:00:12,954
power of the radicand. So if the numerator are here, we'll see that as a power

4
00:00:12,954 --> 00:00:17,776
inside of our radical sign. And then b, is the index of the radical or it tells

5
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:24,700
us which type of root we're taking. A square, a cube or maybe something else.

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:29,288
So if we see something like x to the 3 5ths, we really know that's the 5th root

7
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:36,484
of x cubed. Here's our power and here's our index. Power divided by root.
