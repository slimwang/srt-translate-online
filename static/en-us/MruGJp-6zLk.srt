1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now what's the probability of winning from a state?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It seems complicated. It seems like we've got a lot of work to do,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
but actually, we've almost solved the whole thing.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
All we have to do is say, "What's the end point?"

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So remember, we start out in the start position,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and then we have some end positions

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
where the game is over, and we have to assign utilities,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which is the same as probability of winning,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
which is either 0 or 1.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So this is a losing state, so it gets a Pwin of 0.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is a winning state. It gets Pwin of 1.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We assign all of those, and then

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
all the other states that depend on these--

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
we've already figured that out in terms of the Q function.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's see how that works.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So the probability of winning is 1 if my current score

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
plus the pending is greater than or equal to goal.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Then I win automatically just by reaping those pending.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My probability of winning is 0 if your score

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
is greater than the goal and I haven't won.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And otherwise, my probability of winning

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
is the probability that I get by taking the best action.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So for all the actions--

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
among all the actions I can do,

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
look for the Q value of that action--

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
from the current state

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
according to the utility function--

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
try to maximize that, and that's going to be

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
my probability of winning.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So that's saying I can make the best choice that I can.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So we said that we had 3 choice points.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Here, I'm making the best choice by maximizing.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Here, the die gets to roll, and we're averaging--

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
we're summing them all up and dividing by 6,

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
so that takes care of the averaging--

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and what about the worst choice that the opponent makes?

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, that's just folded in because rather than

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
explicitly worrying about me and my opponent,

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I just said, "Well, I can use

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
1 minus the probability of me winning."

41
00:01:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the probability of the opponent winning.
