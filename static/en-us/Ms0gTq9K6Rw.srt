00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For this question, Alice has created a circuit with onion router 1 and onion router 2,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and she wants to extend that to include onion router 3 and onion router 4.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And the question is, how many more total messages are transmitted?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Count one for every time a message is sent over a single-hop link.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
To help you get started, the first two messages are Alice sends a message to onion router 1

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
to relay on c1 where c1 equals circuit 1

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
to relay on circuit 2 to extend to onion router 3 and continue on with the message.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Onion router 1 sends a message to onion router 2 to relay on circuit 2 to extend to onion router 3.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And so on. So how many messages do we need?
