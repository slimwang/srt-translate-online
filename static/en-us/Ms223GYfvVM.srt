1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
That is frustrating. Somehow the maximum likelihood estimator seems reckless.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We have almost no data, and it comes up with these really extreme guesses

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
of what the underlying probability is.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I would submit this as unintuitive.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you and I flip a coin and it comes up heads,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we would not say obviously this coin always comes up heads.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We would say maybe a little bit more frequently but let's flip it more often.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You're not yet convinced there might not be tails as there is in this case.
