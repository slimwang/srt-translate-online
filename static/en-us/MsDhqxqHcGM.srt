00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,200
To factor the first trinomial, we want to find factors of 30 that sum to

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,910
negative 11. These factors are negative 5 and negative 6, and since our

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,450
quadratic term has a 1 in front of it, we can just use these factors in our

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,975
factored form here. X minus 5 times x minus 6. For the denominator we want to

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:21,703
find factors of 1 times 20, or 20. That sum to negative 9. Those would be

6
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:25,475
negative 4 and negative 5. And again since our quadratic term has a 1 as the

7
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:29,681
coefficient, we'll use these factors in our factored form. Great job factoring

8
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:32,363
if you got one or both of those correct.
