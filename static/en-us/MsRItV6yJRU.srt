00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Awhile back I've told you about the Simpson's paradox and it was

2

surprising how easy it was to draw the false conclusion from data.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today I will give you a deep insight of the common mistakes that's being made

in interpreting statistical data by confusing correlation with causation.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'll show you example where data is correlated

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and why it's tempted to confuse correlation with causation.

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
