1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,290
You just found the differences between these two files by hand and

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,040
it worked all right.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,670
But it probably seemed pretty tedious and the files were also small.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,250
What if you had files with hundreds or even thousands of lines?

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,700
Let's take a look at what we could do in that case.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,640
Now, let's take a look at a program that require's a bit more code.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,720
This is a game called Asteroids and I know this text is a little hard to read,

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,000
but it says press space to start.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,430
Some of you may recognize that this is a classic arcade game that has been

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,390
ported so you can play it in the browser.

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,280
You press the left and

12
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:33,450
right arrow keys to turn the ship, up to fire the engine, and space to shoot.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,970
Props to Doug McGuiness for creating this game.

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,170
If you want to play it yourself,

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,400
there's a link to it on Doug's website in the instructor notes.

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,850
But right now, we're going to be focusing on finding a bug in its code.

17
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,980
The code for this game is in JavaScript.

18
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,120
But don't worry, you won't need to know JavaScript to complete the exercise.

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,480
I thought using space to fire the engine might be more intuitive to me, so

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,040
I changed the controls for the game to use space instead of up arrow.

21
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,750
Then I needed a different way to shoot, so

22
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,930
I decided to use enter instead of space for that.

23
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,510
But when I tried the game out,

24
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,610
the engines didn't work at all anymore, I couldn't move.

25
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,350
I think I made a typo, but I'm not sure where.

26
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,040
Most of the code for this game,

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,860
including the codes that maps keys to actions, is in a file called game.js.

28
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,871
Now, this file contains over a thousand lines.

29
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,010
It would be way too time consuming to go through this entire file,

30
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,570
comparing the new version to the old version.

31
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,350
Fortunately, there are a bunch of tools that can automatically find

32
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,110
differences between files.

33
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,530
If you're using Windows,

34
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,740
you have a tool in the command prompt called FC, which stands for file compare.

35
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,570
If you're using Mac or Linux, then FC is a different unrelated command, but

36
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:46,460
you have a built-in tool, called Diff, you can use, which stands for difference.

37
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,320
I'll demonstrate using these tools to compare the HTML you

38
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,470
just compared manually in the previous exercise.

39
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,360
Then I'll ask you to go through the same process to

40
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,970
find the differences in game.js.

41
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,780
On Windows, I'll open the command prompt first.

42
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,770
By the way, if you'd prefer to use git bash to complete this exercise, then,

43
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,860
you can follow the instructions for the Mac and

44
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,680
Linux students that are coming in a minute.

45
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,310
But for now,

46
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,570
I'm going to show how to complete the exercise in the command prompt.

47
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,010
So first, I'll need to change to the directory that has my files in it.

48
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,800
So I'll type cd Downloads.

49
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,150
Since I downloaded my files to the downloads folder.

50
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,620
Now I'll enter the command FC favorite-app-old.html favorite-app.html.

51
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,600
So, to the FC or File Compare Program, I passed two files,

52
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,530
the first one that I want to compare, and the second.

53
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,990
Now, when I hit enter, I can see that

54
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:39,760
I'm comparing the files Favorite-app-old.html and FAVORITE-APP.HTML.

55
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,170
So, each of these two sections are showing different parts of the file.

56
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,708
So here, you can see that favorite-app-old.html href style-1.css, and

57
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,260
FAVORITE-AP.HTML href style-!.css.

58
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,570
Then down here, you can see the next section that changed,

59
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,040
which was the description.

60
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,820
Some description here changed to the fun fact.

61
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,480
Did you know that sunflowers were used to remove toxins from

62
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,850
a pond after the Chernobyl disaster?

63
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,580
Sections that didn't change aren't shown,

64
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,570
since we're only trying to focus on the differences here.

65
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,870
On Mac or Linux, I'll open the terminal, navigate to where the files are,

66
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:19,116
then enter the command diff -u favorite-app-old.html favorite-app.html.

67
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,760
The -u option stands for

68
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,610
unified diff format and it will make the output a little easier to read.

69
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,810
Now, I'll go ahead and hit Enter.

70
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,530
The output format here is a little bit different than for FC.

71
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,230
I'll scroll back up.

72
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,120
And first, you can see that there were some lines at the top.

73
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,640
And you don't really need to worry about these lines.

74
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,255
They're just showing you that you're comparing favorite-app-old.html,

75
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:45,195
to favorite-app.html.

76
00:03:45,195 --> 00:03:48,970
Ones with no plus or minus sign next to them like these haven't changed.

77
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,480
That is they existed in both the old version of the file and the new version.

78
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,530
Lines with a minus sign were removed.

79
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,110
That is they existed in the old version, but not the new version.

80
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,550
And lines with a plus sign were added, so vice versa.

81
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,570
Now I'll scroll back down.

82
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,040
And here's the style sheet change that you found earlier.

83
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,970
And here's the description change.

84
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,430
Now, go ahead and download the filesgameold.js and gamenew.js from

85
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:18,260
the downloadable section and compare them using either FC or Diff.

86
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,220
Your files will probably be downloaded to the downloads folder, so

87
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,040
you can navigate there by using CD downloads, just like I did.

88
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:30,250
What word contains a typo in the version of game.js but not in the old version?

89
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,610
Once you found the word, enter it in this box.

90
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,300
Use the correct spelling for the word.
