1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now I'd like to ask you the same question

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
except for a student with high school GPA

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
greater than college GPA.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So for someone who did better in high school

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
than college, would a point for that person

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
be above the line,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
on the line

8
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or below the line?
