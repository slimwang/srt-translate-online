1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,935
So we have this lovely equation, which is a great start, but it's still a pretty

2
00:00:04,947 --> 00:00:09,613
general equation. Money spent over here, looks like just one lump sum. And

3
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:14,341
chances are, that Grant's not going to spend all of his money at one time. In

4
00:00:14,353 --> 00:00:19,251
fact, it turns out that he's made a budget for himself, where he allows himself

5
00:00:19,263 --> 00:00:24,161
to spend $100,000 every month. So this means that over time, as each month goes

6
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:28,710
by. The total amount of money that he spent will change. So this means that we

7
00:00:28,722 --> 00:00:32,822
can rewrite money spent over here, in a different way, using this new

8
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:37,471
information. So, which of these choices do you think would be a new but accurate

9
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:41,775
way to write out the amount of money that Grant has spent total at any given

10
00:00:41,787 --> 00:00:42,056
time?
