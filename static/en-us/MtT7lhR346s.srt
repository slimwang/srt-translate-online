1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,550
Okay, in this lesson, we will explore how lookup tables in routers are designed

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,410
and how longest prefix match works. We'll

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,440
explore exact match versus longest prefix match

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,010
and when each is used. We'll explore IP address lookup in more depth. And

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,230
finally, we'll explore how longest prefix match

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,220
is implemented in the form of tries.
