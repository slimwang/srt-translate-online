00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,790
Here the solutions for x are 4 plus or minus 2i times root 5. Fantastic work if

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,528
you found those solutions. This one wasn't so simple. First we subtract 36 from

3
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:15,539
both sides, to get this equation. Next, we complete the square by adding b over

4
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:21,013
2 squared to both sides. The b value is negative 8. So, that makes b over 2,

5
00:00:21,013 --> 00:00:26,074
negative 4. We square this number to get 16. Adding 16 to both sides of the

6
00:00:26,074 --> 00:00:30,554
equation, we get x minus 4 squared, this is our perfect square and negative 20

7
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:36,180
on the right. We take the square root of both sides of the equation, to get x

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,474
minus 4 equals plus or minus the square root of negative 20. Then, we add 4 to

9
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:45,655
both sides of the equation to get our solutions for x. We do need to do one

10
00:00:45,655 --> 00:00:49,504
more step. We need to simplify. The square root of negative 20 is going to be

11
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:54,245
an imaginary number, since the radicand is negative. We can split up the square

12
00:00:54,245 --> 00:00:58,220
root of negative 20 into these three square roots. The square root of negative

13
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,587
1 is i, the square root of 4 is 2. And we can't take the square root of 5, so

14
00:01:02,587 --> 00:01:06,780
we leave it underneath the radical. These are our simplified solutions
