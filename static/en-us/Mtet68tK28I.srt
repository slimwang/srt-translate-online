1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,500
Recall, in previous lecture we
talked about that in essence video

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,050
is nothing else, but images that are
stacked on top of each other in time.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,580
And we looked at basically, how we can
access this by looking over x and y, and

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,560
looking at basically, how we can stack
these images over time like this.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,040
And that allows us to look at digital
video basically in a similar manner,

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,690
as we did for images.

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,730
Basically, looking for x and
y stacked in time, and of course,

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,230
we can access any part of this
image by basically looking at

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:35,785
how we can access it in x and y, or
i and j for discreet ones in time.

10
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:39,080
We also discussed the concept of
video resolution extending from

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,100
concept of image resolution, and
looked at aspect ratios of videos, and

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,760
talked about where I
did a video formats.

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,620
Again, this is just to
kind of remind you,

14
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,070
what we've talked about
before in terms of image and

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,940
video representation, and
similarities and differences in each.
