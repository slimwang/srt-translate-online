1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now apply the Forward Euler Method to the following situation:

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We drill a big hole and let a mouse fall into that hole.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The mouse starts at height 0 and at velocity 0.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The height is going to be our x-coordinate.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That means that x(0) = 0.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:29,000
V(0) = 0, and a(t) = f/m = -9.81 m/s2--

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
minus because the velocity is going to become negative.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Your job is to provide the appropriate code to

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
compute the t and x and v values

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
for all steps.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We create these arrays with 51 entries

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
so that the entry number 0 can be the initial value,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and you compute 50 additional values for each array.
