00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,434
Before we discuss how to recovery from loads done

2
00:00:03,434 --> 00:00:06,689
too early is happening, let's first talk about the

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:10,224
store to load forwarding problem. For a load, we

4
00:00:10,224 --> 00:00:13,176
have to ask ourselves, which earlier store do we

5
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:17,530
get our value from? Basically, there could be multiple

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,680
stores to the same address that our load is

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,230
going to. And we have to figure our which

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,570
store is the one to supply our value and also,

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,600
if none of them are matching, then we need to figure

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,720
that out, because then we need to go to memory. When a

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,304
store is finally resolved, we need to ask ourselves, which later

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,748
load do I give my value to? So there might be a

13
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:40,576
load whose addresses already known, once this store figures out the

14
00:00:40,576 --> 00:00:43,810
address and the value, we should be waking up the load that

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,050
wants that value. Note that there could be multiple loads that

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,590
the store needs to give the value to. So where do we

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,810
figure this out? In the load store queue.
