1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now that you know about Boolean formulas,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
so what is the SAT problem?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The SAT problem has as an input a Boolean formula with N variables,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and I'm usually going to write them as X1, X2, and so on until you get to Xn,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and the output or question since SAT is a decision problem is the following:

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And the question is, can you set the variables

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
X1 to Xn to a combination of true or false so

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that the whole formula that you're given in the input becomes true?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And the answer to that can, of course, only be yes or no,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
so again, SAT is a decision problem.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So for example, if we're given a very simple Boolean formula such X1 and X2,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and then the answer to SAT would be yes

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
because you could set X1 to true and X2 to true,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and then the whole formula would also evaluate to true

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
because you have 1 and 1,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
which is true or 1.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's do a little bit more challenging example.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If you had a Boolean formula such as this,

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
x1 and X2 or 1 and not X1 or X2,

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and what you can also see here is that

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
you do not always have to put brackets around each or to

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
signify in which order you evaluate the individual ones,

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
so it's okay to write 2 or 3 or 4 or's

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
or 2 or 3 or 4 and's

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
or even more if you want to

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
without doing those brackets.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It really doesn't make a difference in the way that the formula evaluates.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But let's come back to SAT.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So does this Boolean formula here have a satisfying assignment,

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
meaning can you set the variables to a combination of true and false

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
so that the whole formula becomes true, and here the answer is again yes.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
X1, unfortunately, doesn't really help here.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So if you set X1 to true for example, this would also be true.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And here you have not X1, so X1 and not X1, that would evaluate to 0.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If you set X1 to 0, then you have it the other way around,

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and then let's set X2 to 1 because then this whole thing here is 1,

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
this stays at 0 no matter what we do,

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and this one also goes to 1,

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and then you have 1 or 0 or 1 so there's at least one 1 in here,

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and so the whole thing evaluates to 1,

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and the formula can be satisfied.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So now let's see if you can figure out an even more challenging example yourself.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So here's our Boolean formula,

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
X1 or X3 and X1 and X2 or not X3,

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and the formula continues here,

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
not X2 or not X3 and not X1 or not X2,

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and I'm going reveal to you that this

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
formula indeed has an assignment of true and false

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
to the variables X1, X2, and X3

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
so that the whole formula is satisfied,

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
meaning it evaluates to true.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What I want to know from you is

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
how I have to set the variables to do this.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So if I should set X1 to false, please check here.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If I should set it to 2, please check here,

56
00:03:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the same thing for the variables X2 and X3, please.
