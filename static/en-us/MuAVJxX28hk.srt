00:00:15,404 --> 00:00:17,009
Hey, welcome back.

3
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:20,068
Have you ever wanted a framework
that comes with its own build tool,

4
00:00:20,068 --> 00:00:23,398
will automatically generate and
maintain your apps file structure, and

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,127
keep your templates and data in sync?

6
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:27,940
Then you're probably looking for
something like Ember.

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,990
And we're now going to look
at an Ember framework.

8
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,470
As we go through this lesson,

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,360
I encourage you to work through
each of the steps yourself.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,695
Building up the app along with me.

11
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:39,370
You'll learn a lot by watching me
work through building a project, but

12
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,460
you'll learn so
much more if you build it yourself.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,030
Ember describes itself as a framework
for creating ambitious web applications

14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,060
and boy does it help you
easily create ambitious apps.

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,290
It's an extremely powerful framework and
is powered sites for companies

16
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,820
like Netflix, Groupon, Discourse,
Twitch, Yahoo and even Microsoft.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,160
So Ember will be able to handle
anything you could throw at it.

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,170
Ember enables you to create
powerful apps with ease

19
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,260
because it favors convention
over configuration.

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,950
You have to name and
organize your files a certain way.

21
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,190
Depending on the kind of file, you also
have to place it in a specific location

22
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,940
in the project's file structure.

23
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,980
At first, this might seem
daunting to maintain, but

24
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,150
using Ember's command line tool,
it couldn't be simpler.

25
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,690
Another benefit of this strict
app organization is that

26
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,830
every Ember apps structure is the same,

27
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,390
and developers new to your team
will be able to jump right in.

28
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,470
Doesn't Ember sound awesome?

29
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,150
Let's get going so

30
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,260
you can build your next project
with this powerful framework.
