Let's talk a bit more about the behavior of these exponential decay and

2
00:00:03,506 --> 00:00:10,138
exponential growth functions. In particular, what are their domains and ranges?

3
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:17,242
The functions that are graphed here are y equals one half to the x. Or now you

4
00:00:17,242 --> 00:00:22,786
know, this is the same as y equals 2 to the negative x. And over here, we have

5
00:00:22,786 --> 00:00:27,572
y equals 2 to the x. For each function, please use interval notation to write

6
00:00:27,572 --> 00:00:32,284
in the domain and range. Although using the graphs can be helpful to answer

7
00:00:32,284 --> 00:00:37,160
this question, the equations are also really useful. For each domain, try to

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,060
see if there are any values of x that produce invalid answers when plugged into

9
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:48,062
the function. And for the range, think about what values the function can and

10
00:00:48,062 --> 00:00:50,600
can't take on.
