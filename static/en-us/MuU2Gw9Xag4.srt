Model view octopus is everywhere, but most people don't call it an octopus.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,189
They have much more boring names for it.

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,560
Sorry, Larry.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,090
MVC stands for a Model View Controller.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,910
MVVM stands for Model View ViewModel, that's one word at the end, ViewModel.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,740
Model view presenter is MVP.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,990
You might run into all three of these in your professional career,

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,130
but don't panic like I did when I first learned.

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,290
They are all just different ways of solving the same problem.

10
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,100
How do we separate concerns so we can minimize connections?

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,190
So, with MVC, our octopus is called the controller.

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,730
With MVVM, we call it the view model.

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,490
And MVP, we call it the presenter.

14
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,710
Now, if you Google these terms, you'll find tons of articles and forum threads

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,130
discussing all the differences between these three different paradigms.

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,560
But those articles usually assume that the reader knows that they're

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,780
fundamentally at their core the same thing.

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,993
They're [SOUND] all octopi,

19
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:01,730
just with slightly different personalities and preferences.
