1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,000
Okay.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,020
Let's see where these fit in.

3
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,010
Let's start with GitHub.

4
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,520
GitHub is a service that lets users interact with Git.

5
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,970
There are couple of different ways that we could've represented this.

6
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:14,970
Maybe GitHub operates on Git, or maybe even that GitHub refers to Git.

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,590
But I chose to represent it as Git being a part of GitHub.

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,540
Now let's think about remotes.

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,340
A remote in your local repository is basically a reference to

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,500
another repository, so we can say that remote refers to repositories.

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,720
Also when you clone a repository, a remote gets set up for

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,710
you automatically, so we can say that clone operators on remotes.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,660
So remote goes here.

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,570
At this point the remaining two spots are exactly the same.

15
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,470
They both operate on both remote and branch.

16
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,830
So we could put these in either spot.

17
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,630
Let's check that this actually makes sense.

18
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,600
When you push or pull, you have to specify what branch you want to push or pull.

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,810
So, it definitely operates on branches.

20
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:02,420
Pull takes a branch from a remote and brings it to your local repository.

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,360
And push does the opposite, taking a branch and pushing it to a remote.

22
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,240
So these do both operate on a remote as well.

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,460
All right.

24
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,180
We now have our Concept Map up to this point.
