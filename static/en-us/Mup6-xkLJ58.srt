The connection between the virtual and the real one is becoming closer every

2
00:00:03,338 --> 00:00:07,100
day. One aspect that I find particularly exciting is how objects we design in

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,988
the virtual world can be made real just a few hours later. Even if you don't own

4
00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:15,034
a 3D printer, you can order 3D printed objects from a business that does. For

00:00:15,034 --> 00:00:18,630
example I found this teapot model on the web at Sculpteo, a 3D print service

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,814
provider based in France. I previewed it on the website in Web GL, picked out

7
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,708
the material, and ordered it. At that point, there was no physical model, it was

8
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:30,460
just data on a computer somewhere. A week later, when the real thing arrived

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,806
here in California, that honestly amazes me. To learn more about the connection

00:00:34,806 --> 00:00:38,823
between 3D graphics and 3D printing. Jessie Harrington Au and I talked about

00:00:38,823 --> 00:00:41,113
these topics while at the Autodesk gallery.
