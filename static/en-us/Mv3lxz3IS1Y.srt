1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,700
I think the light sensor would be the best answer.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,330
Cause then you would know that it's dark and your

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,870
users asleep. But also the accelerometer and the gyroscope, would

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,620
tell you that your user hasn't moved so their sleeping.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,750
>> Yeah, and you would think that this is an isolated problem, but

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,100
it's not. In fact it's such a huge issue for users, that there

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,350
exists entire category application. Agent being one of them. Which actually is a

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,430
stand alone app, which silences your

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,740
phone. So that other applications won't disturb

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,670
you in the middle of the night, with information you don't really want.

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,160
>> Apps like Trigger take into account

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,049
these triggers like light and accelerometer. And

13
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,610
they know that if you're sleeping or

14
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,050
you're not moving, they'll silence your whole phone.

15
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,590
But if you're building an application that

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,720
provides sports updates. You should take advantage of

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,990
these sensors within the application, and deliver

18
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,860
the notification when you know the user's awake.
