1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,850
Now we just walked you through
how to create an application

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,980
on Google app engine.

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,830
You might have ran into some issues.

4
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,330
If you don't have a working projet
at this time, no worries at all.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,490
We're going to show you a short cut
that lets you create an app engine

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,810
application that you can use yourself.

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,620
We're back in Google
app engine launcher,

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,790
let's click on file,
then create new application.

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,700
What this is going to do is it's
going to set up all the folders and

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,740
files and
make sure everything works correctly.

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,380
We can call it whatever we want but
for now let's just use Engine App.

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,930
I'm going to select browse to
pick where I want this saved and

13
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,810
I'm just going to save
it on the desktop.

14
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,090
So I'm going to click the desktop,
click OK, and we're ready to go.

15
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,650
Let's click create,
now you can see another application

16
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,150
in the Google App Engine Launcher,
Engine App.

17
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,620
Let's go ahead and run it locally,
now that it's running, let's view it in

18
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,960
the browser by clicking browse and
look at that, it says hello world.

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,030
Okay, so
we're running our application locally.

20
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,500
Let's confirm that it
was actually created.

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,020
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to open up the desktop, and

22
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,200
as you can see,
the engine app folder was created.

23
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,370
Let's open it, and we have main.pie,
we have app.yamel and

24
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,220
a couple of other files that
Google App Engine created for us.

25
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,000
We only have to worry about main.pie,
and app.yamel for

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,540
now so let's open them up with Sublime.

27
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,100
I'm going to right click, select
Open With, and then choose Sublime.

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,280
And we're in Sublime,
let's scroll down and look at that.

29
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,960
All the contents from our
file are in here now.

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,470
Google App Engine created that for

31
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,860
you and made sure everything
was set up properly.

32
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,540
Now that we've confirmed that the
main.pi file is the same let's go check

33
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,920
out app.yaml.

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,650
Great so we're back in the project
folder, let's open up app.yaml and

35
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,310
confirm it has everything
we're looking for.

36
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,910
I'm going to right click on app.yaml,
select Open.

37
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,880
And it looks like Windows
can't open this file,

38
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,990
let's select a program from
a list of installed programs.

39
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,280
We're going to open it up with Sublime
so let's see if we can find it in there.

40
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,630
I'll click OK, and there's sublime.

41
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,660
Let's select it,
click OK and there we go.

42
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,320
So, we're in our app.yaml file and

43
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,740
it looks like that we've
got everything we need.

44
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,730
Google app engine added in a little
bit of additional information,

45
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,900
but really we need to focus on
the application ID right here.

46
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,340
Right now the application
ID is engine app.

47
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,640
But let's go ahead and paste in our
application ID we created before.

48
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,970
Now that we've pasted in our
application ID let's go ahead and

49
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,220
save this file and
now we want to deploy it.

50
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,930
Let's see if it actually works.

51
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,280
I'm going to go back to
Google App Engine Launcher.

52
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,850
I'm going to highlight our
application and click deploy.

53
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,500
Okay, let's take a look at our log and
yes,

54
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,200
it looks like our
deployment was successful.

55
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,890
Let's open it up in the browser, and
make sure everything worked out okay.

56
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,280
I'm going to go to our
application ID.appsot.com.

57
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,660
Let's reload the page and
see what happens.

58
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,220
And look at that, we have Hello world.

59
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,110
Everything worked great.
