1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,040
Starting with mean and
standard deviation.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,450
We call the function mean and
std on our dataframe to get the values.

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,380
Let's go ahead and check the mean and
the standard deviation for

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,140
the daily returns of SPY stock.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,930
So we get the mean and
the standard deviation.

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,490
Happy with just knowing the mean and
standard deviation value?

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,720
But I am not.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,980
I want to see it on the plot,
just like Professor did.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,975
So let's learn how to add mean and
standard deviation line on plot.

10
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:35,220
Matplotlib library has
a function axvline.

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,310
Looking at the substring vline,
we can guess it will give vertical line.

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,310
Let's check out its parameters.

13
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,660
First we pass the mean value,
then just for beautification and so

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,640
that we can differentiate the mean line
from the rest histogram, we add a color,

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,670
which is white, make it a dashed style
line and increase the linewidth to two.

16
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,620
Now let's check our output.

17
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,000
So this our mean and this is how
it is plotted on the histogram.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,950
Now let's go ahead and
plot standard deviation.

19
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,710
To plot the standard deviation line,
it is similar to the mean.

20
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,130
But as we want the standard deviation
line on both side of the mean,

21
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,110
we plot it twice.

22
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,456
One with the positive value and
one with the negative value,

23
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:25,460
to show standard deviation line
on either side of the mean.

24
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,530
Ta dah, we have our standard
deviation lines on our graph.

25
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,090
To give the standard
deviation a red color,

26
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,940
I have just replaced the parameter
color of white, with red.

27
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,030
Now I'm happy with the graph and
I hope you do are.

28
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,560
Let's move ahead to kurtosis.

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,430
We can expect that dataframe
would have a function for

30
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,110
calculating kurtosis as well.

31
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,290
So that's it.

32
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,080
This line will give you
kurtosis of the daily returns.

33
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:59,860
We get a positive value for the SPY
stock, which means we have fat tails.

34
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,818
Just for your information,

35
00:02:01,818 --> 00:02:06,610
you can also get bincounts
using numpy.histogram function.

36
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,780
Check instructors notes for
more information.

37
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,740
Over to you professor.
