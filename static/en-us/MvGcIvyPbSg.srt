1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,291
Now Street Views is of course captured
with a camera that's mounted on a car

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:08,180
that goes all over the country or
the world these days.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,474
Of course, there have been other
types of examples of this type of

4
00:00:12,474 --> 00:00:14,667
capturing system on a tricycle here.

5
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:18,277
And there have been sightings also
of much more mobile capture devices,

6
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:18,875
like this.

7
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,641
Again, this is an example of
more authoritative, you know,

8
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:24,793
a company like Google is walking
around to create these amazing maps.

9
00:00:24,793 --> 00:00:28,580
So, I just caught a, captured a segment
from the about Street View site,

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,966
which basically shows at least a simple
pipeline of about how Street Views work.

11
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,410
Starts, of course starts
with collecting imagery.

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,162
In this case,

13
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:39,750
it's similar to the kind of imagery
we have looked at in a panorama.

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,417
Of course, use that align
all of the imagery together.

15
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:46,770
And then of course,
using that to generate a full panorama,

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,010
like the one in attaching it
to the maps on the street.

17
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,500
So this is in essence a simplistic
pipeline of how Street Views works.

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,922
Of course, there's a whole lot of
machinery in there that I cannot tell

19
00:00:56,922 --> 00:00:59,958
you anything about, because most
of it might also be proprietary.

20
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:03,836
But in essence, what you see is they
actually can use images from the special

21
00:01:03,836 --> 00:01:06,208
panoramic cameras, registered, aligned.

22
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:09,250
And then of course,
create images like this.

23
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,130
Of course, we also want to do this
kind of stuff with our own images.

24
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,585
So here is something, this morning, I,
before I was walking into my office and

25
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:19,792
I just used my iPhone to take
a bunch of different images.

26
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:23,247
And of course, they are interesting
in their own right, but

27
00:01:23,247 --> 00:01:26,583
I just uploaded them to Photosynth and
here is the output.

28
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,920
And again, remember,
these are pictures I took.

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,708
Now just the walk through
here into my office.

30
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,141
Now, of course if you,
if I had office hours,

31
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:37,348
this is where you would come to see me.

32
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:39,457
My office here again.

33
00:01:39,457 --> 00:01:42,008
If you're really interested,
you can zoom in here and

34
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:45,625
see the friends that we've seen in
a variety of different lectures already.

35
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:48,458
Sitting there in my office,
waiting for me.

36
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:49,138
Now, again,

37
00:01:49,138 --> 00:01:52,959
this is giving you a sense of its 3Dness
of the environment is far from perfect.

38
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,333
Alignment is not there.

39
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,179
But remember,

40
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:59,417
this is just like 20 pictures that you
use to generate this walk-through.

41
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:03,585
Quite impressive, you can manipulate
it and visualize again, a photo tour.
