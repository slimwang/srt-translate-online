1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
To solve this, let's look at the steps that we counted for n = 4.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
These first two always happen regardless of n.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We have 4 range calls, which corresponds to this range call.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This one is going to happen n times.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If n = 10, we would get 10 range calls.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Then we have 0, 1, here's 2, and here's 3 print statements that correspond to this.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In general, we're going to have 1 print statement plus 2 print statements

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
plus 3 print statements plus etc, etc, all the way up to n - 1 print statements,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
which equals n( n - 1)/2.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Adding up these three parts we get 2 + n + n(n - 1)/2.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We can quickly check.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
In the case of n = 4, we get 2 + 4 + (4 * 3)/2, which equals 12.
