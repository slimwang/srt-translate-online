00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,910
Here's what I was looking for.

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:05,040
It's just the trivial lower
bound of n squared over L.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,200
The n squared just counts
the number of matrix elements

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,590
dividing by L diverts n squared
into some number of transfers.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,300
Now if you're really
way ahead of the game,

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,740
you might happen to know
the much tighter lower bound.

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,880
I would not have expected
you to guess this, but

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,340
if you did I am definitely impressed.

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,910
Anyway, we'll hopefully get to this
at some point in the near future.
