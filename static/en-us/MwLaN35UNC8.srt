1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,860
First, a block cipher should use
substitution to achieve confusion.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,140
This is correct.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,430
Second, a block cipher should use
permutation to achieve diffusion.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,870
This is correct.

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,400
Third, a block cipher
should use a few rounds,

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,480
each with a combination of
substitution and permutation.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,760
This is correct.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,870
These are the three high level
properties of block ciphers

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,860
that we have just discussed.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,590
Fourth, a block cipher should
keep the algorithm secret.

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,150
This is false.

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,420
Because we should never
keep the algorithm secret.

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,630
We should only keep the key secret.

14
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:40,350
Many researchers have analyzed
a public or standard algorithm and

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,380
improved its security.

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,280
Therefore, a public or

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,130
standard algorithm can be more
secure than a secret algorithm.

18
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,020
Therefore, we should
use a public algorithm.
