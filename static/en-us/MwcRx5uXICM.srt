1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now, I'd like to ask you about what happens as the number of flips

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
or events, in general, becomes a very large number.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Check all that apply. The probability of every individual sequence becomes small

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The probability of every number of heads becomes small.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So for example, does the probability of having one head or hundred heads or million heads,

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
any specific number does that becomes small.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Does the probability of every given proportion, for example, one head out of 100 flips,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
10 heads out of 100 flips or 1500 heads out of a billion flips becomes small.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Does every given range of proportions have a smaller and smaller probability.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Are there some ranges of proportions for which the probability becomes small as we have many flips.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Check all that apply. Also, assume that the probability of heads is neither 0 or 1.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That is, we can get both heads and tails from this coin.
