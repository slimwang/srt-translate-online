00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,620
Try rationalizing these denominators. When we rationalize a denominator, we

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,760
want to multiply by something so it eliminates the radical in the denominator.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,108
So what do you think we need to multiply each of these fractions by, and what

4
00:00:13,108 --> 00:00:15,383
would be the final result?
