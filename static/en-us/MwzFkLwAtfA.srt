00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,330
Let me now demonstrate a bit of code to
do an affine transformation of an image.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,540
The usual preamble of loading an image,
an out, open cv and

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,990
numpy, reading the image.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,190
And here, rather than do other types of
things with transformations, we're going

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,500
to take much of a, approach where we can
identify the points of transformation.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,280
So I basically now come up
with first user points.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,020
And if you notice here, I'm giving it
three different points, in first image,

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,440
and three different points
in the second image.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,720
Using these two points,
I can now create a, affine, basically

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,440
apply the affine transformation to
compute a transformation matrix.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,980
And I'll, once we have the
transformation matrix, we can apply it

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,240
to the image that we already know all
the other information of like, for

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,760
example, width and height.

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,530
And after, of course, we have applied
it, we can display the image.

15
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,050
Just run this code here.

16
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,860
So, from those three points that we
used, we were able to compute an,

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,630
transformation matrix which
is actually printed out here.

18
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,390
This was my original image.

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,962
And this is the final output image after
the transformation matrix applied of

20
00:01:04,962 --> 00:01:06,521
giving it an affine warp.

21
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:10,275
Now you can see the image have been
warped, but again, notice straight lines

22
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:14,055
are straddle straight lines as we
talked about earlier in the lecture.

23
00:01:14,055 --> 00:01:18,663
It just basically has more of an affect
of being able to be, create a warp, or

24
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:22,080
a kind of a shear in two
different directions here.

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,234
All lines are still straight
as you can see here.

26
00:01:27,275 --> 00:01:30,160
The straight line still remains
straight in this transformation.
