1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,140
So Katie, this is going to be a unit on unsupervised learning.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,060
>> Unsupervised learning is something that's very important,

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,250
because most of the time, the data that you get in the real world doesn't have

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,210
little flags attached that tell you the correct answer.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,730
So what are you to do as a machine learner in that case?

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,120
You turn to unsupervised techniques to still figure something out

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,620
about that data.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,310
>> Okay, let's talk about them.

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,930
Given a dataset without labels over all the data points are of the same class.

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,530
There are sometimes still things you can do to extract useful information.

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:37,200
Like this dataset over here, where I would say this dataset is structured in

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,190
a way that is useful to recognize for a machine learning algorithm.

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,480
>> When we look at this by eye, it looks like there's clumps or

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,060
clusters in the data.

15
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,560
And if we could identify those clumps or clusters, we could maybe say something

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,730
about a new, unknown data point and what its neighbors might be like.

17
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,710
>> Or here's a second example of data.

18
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,850
Maybe the data looks just like this.

19
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,050
There's something we can say here as well.

20
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:01,910
>> Right.

21
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,410
So all the data in this example looks like it lives on some kind of line or

22
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,960
some complicated shape that you seem to be drawing in there right now.

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,582
>> Yeah. And it's, it's, it's used to be a two-dimensional space, with x and

24
00:01:12,582 --> 00:01:13,710
y over here.

25
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,200
But some of it we can reduce it to a one-dimensional line.

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,580
So that's called what?

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,830
>> That's called dimensionality reduction, usually.

28
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,089
>> Dimensionality reduction.

29
00:01:21,089 --> 00:01:23,200
So we learned about, a little bit about clustering.

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,830
>> Clustering is what we'll learn in this lesson.

31
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,288
>> And you can see here an example of something also called unsupervised

32
00:01:29,288 --> 00:01:31,890
learning of dimensionality reduction.

33
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,010
>> Which we will get in a future lesson.

34
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,792
>> So these kind of things where you find structure in the data without labels,

35
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,938
they're called unsupervised learning.

36
00:01:39,938 --> 00:01:42,350
And we're now gong to dive into the wonderful,

37
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,040
wonderful magical land of unsupervised learning.

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,100
>> Sounds great, let's dive in.
