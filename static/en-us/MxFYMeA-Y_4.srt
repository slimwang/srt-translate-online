00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,450
We've covered what machine
learning is and what it can do.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,360
Now let's dive in a little
bit to how it works.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,070
To close this foundation section we
want to start with a couple of simple

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,930
examples of machine learning in
action from Sebastian's artificial

00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,720
intelligence course.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,310
Note how these methods can be described
as finding ways to build models of data.

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,000
We'll also cover a bit of vocabulary
that you'll need to know later in

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,090
the nano-degree program,
like classification and regression.
