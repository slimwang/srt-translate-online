00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So here's the answer to our programming exercise:

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We simply set up a loop over our calls,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
evaluate the calls as recorded,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
store the result in the return variable,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and then print out the call, an equal sign, and the result.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's see what this does.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And you see, we actually invoke remove HTML markup

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
with the recorded value and get a new result,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we invoke square root again with the recorded value

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and get a square root of 2.
