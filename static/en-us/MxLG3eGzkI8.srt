00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,840
You have n numbers that must sum to 10. So your first number plus your second

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:14,524
number, plus all the way to the nth number, has to equal 10. You may choose a

3
00:00:14,524 --> 00:00:19,470
certain number of values, these xi's, any way you wish. But then a certain

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,260
number of values are forced, so that they sum to 10. How many degrees of

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,754
freedom are there? Or in other words, how many values may you choose any way

6
00:00:27,754 --> 00:00:30,579
you wish. This is tricky.
