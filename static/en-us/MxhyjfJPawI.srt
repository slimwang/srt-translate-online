1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,094
All right, let's start off, just to
confirm that we did everything right,

2
00:00:04,094 --> 00:00:05,896
in the previous video, by hitting play.

3
00:00:05,896 --> 00:00:07,941
[BLANK_AUDIO]

4
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:12,760
You should be able to see the vacation
block, but you can't click on it.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,550
So, how do we make it interactive?

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,030
To interact with things
in our VR experiences,

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,690
we need to use the event
system in Unity.

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,920
This system listens for

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,270
things that are happening in the scene,
like clicks, hovering and more.

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,539
To use the event system,
let's go to Create,

11
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,630
UI, Event System, okay.

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,010
And if you already had an event
system in your hierarchy,

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,690
don't worry about that.

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,500
Unity will often create one for

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,220
you, when you create certain
types of UI objects, like, text.

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,470
This event system object controls which
type of events we're listening for, and,

17
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,790
you can see, it's already added
a couple of components here.

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,160
The stand alone input module is
the default input module for Unity, and

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,580
it listens to things like a typical game
would need, things like joystick input.

20
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,810
But we aren't making a typical game,
we're making VR.

21
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,140
So for us we want to remove this.

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,640
So click on the little gear icon,
and go down to Remove Component.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,970
We instead want a new info module,

24
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,120
we want one that is going to
be configured for cardboard.

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,710
So go to Add Component and search for

26
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,060
gaze input module, gaze input module.

27
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,830
Okay, there it is and
then press Enter to select that.

28
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,900
The gaze input module is the module
that considers where you're looking at

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,590
with the viewer and
you're pressing the Viewer button.

30
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,950
It's the module for the gaze and click
way of interacting with an environment.

31
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,460
So you look at something and
you click the Viewer and the system will

32
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,939
register that the event occurred,
which we can use with the script.

33
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,360
Okay, so in order for
all of this to work,

34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,580
your clickable objects must have
a collider attached to them.

35
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,610
This can be a sphere collider,
a box collider, a capsule collider, or

36
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,770
anything else.

37
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,500
But for our vacation box,
we're going to use a box collider.

38
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,360
So go ahead, click on your vacation
box over in the hierarchy.

39
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,040
Go to Add Component, and
then search for Box Collider.

40
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,010
Okay, great,

41
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,400
you'll notice that it is perfectly
sized to the size of the vacation box.

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,120
If you resize it you'll
see that it completely

43
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,020
snapped to the edges of this box.

44
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,720
So we have a collider
that is perfectly sized

45
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,255
to the size of the vacation box and
we are ready to go with that, okay.

46
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:44,725
So, now that we have a collider,

47
00:02:44,725 --> 00:02:49,645
the next step is we have to get
something talking to this event system.

48
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:51,270
So, how do we do that?

49
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,940
Go ahead and
add a component called an event trigger.

50
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,544
[BLANK_AUDIO]

51
00:02:58,544 --> 00:03:00,910
Event trigger.

52
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,640
Once you do that,

53
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,800
you're going to see a new button
appear called, Add New Event Type.

54
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,490
Go ahead and click on that and

55
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,560
then you're going to see a whole bunch
of different event types pop up.

56
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,170
And you'll notice that
they're all mouse-oriented.

57
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,900
The GazeInputModule converts our VR
reticle into sort of a simulated mouse.

58
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,270
So for us, we want to be able
to click on this vacation box.

59
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:33,200
So go ahead and select PointerClick,
it's right here.

60
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,930
When you do that,

61
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,430
you're going to see a little plus
button appear down at the bottom.

62
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,800
And when you click that little
plus you'll see a new field appear

63
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,520
with an empty object holder.

64
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,030
Now we're going to talk more about
this in the next lesson, but for

65
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,660
now just now just know that this is
where we're going to wire in our method

66
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,500
that changes to our
beautiful island scene.

67
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,190
And we'll hook this up really soon.

68
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,980
Okay, so let's get working in our
next lesson on wiring up that script.
