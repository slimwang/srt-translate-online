00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,220
Now that we have seen partial art of planning in action, let us try to

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,080
do a series of exercises to make sure that we understand it clearly.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,540
We have come across this problem earlier. This is the micro world of blocks.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,190
Here is the initial state. And here is the goal state. We need to transfer from

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,730
this initial state to the goal state, moving only one block at a time.

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,680
Please write on the initial state and the goal state in propositional logic.
