1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, 1 reason there's such a wide discrepancy in the outcomes

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
of these 2 versions of the game is that

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we handicapped E and O so severely

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that here E had to reveal his entire strategy,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
whether he's going to play 1 or 2 all the time,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and the same thing for O over here.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What if we could think of a way where we didn't handicap them quite as much,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
where they weren't giving away quite as much information?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's look at a way to do that.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's look at the situation where E goes first

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and has to reveal the strategy,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but instead of having to reveal my strategy is

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to play 1 or to play 2,

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
what if E says "Well, my strategy is

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
with probability P, I'm going to play 1."

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
"And with probability 1 - P, I'm going to play 2."

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And that's called a mixed strategy.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So, E would announce that strategy for some number P.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And there could be an infinite number of possibilities,

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
so we should be drawing an infinite number of branches

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
out of this decision point for all the possibilities

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
for values of P that E would come up with.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But instead, I'm just going to sort of parameterize that

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and just draw 1 line coming out.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And now O as the minimizing player

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
has to make a choice between 1 and 2, and what are the outcomes?

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, if P was 1, then 1 + 1 is 2,

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
so with probability P, we get an outcome of 2.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That's 2P, but if we choose 2,

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
the probability 1 - P, then 2 + 1 is 3,

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
so with probability 1 - P, we get a -3.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So, 2P - 3 times 1 - P

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
would be the outcome for this day.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And then the outcome over here would be

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
-3P + 4 times 1 - P.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's the parameterized outcome given the parameterized strategy.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And we could do the same thing on the other side.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What if O had to go first?

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
With probability Q, O plays 1,

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and with probability 1 - Q plays 2.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Then even is the maximizer

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and we get 2Q - 3(1 - Q)

43
00:02:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and -3Q + 4(1 - Q).
