00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,400
I created my manifest.json file,
it includes the name and

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,420
short name of full set of icons,
the start_url I want the browser to open

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,580
when the user clicks on it from their
home screen, display: stand alone, so

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,800
that it opens without any browser UI and
background and theme color.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,164
Then in index.html,
I added a link to the manifest file and

6
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:25,270
added a meta theme-color.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,590
Well, it's not required,

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,060
it does add a little extra to
the address bar when it's still visible.

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,635
I also added the tags for
add to home screen on mobile Safari,

10
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,815
apple-mobile-web-app-capable, to
hide the browser UI.

11
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:45,725
Apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style,
to set the status bar style.

12
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:50,010
Apple-mobile-web-app-title, to
set the title

13
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,730
when the app is added
to the home screen.

14
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,890
And the full set of icons.

15
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,060
One note about the icons, to make sure
they look their best, I gave the Apple

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,600
touch icons a white background and
left the other one's transparent.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,730
Finally, I deployed
the weather app to Firebase.

18
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,760
If you want to see exactly what I did,

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,830
the solution I built is linked
in the instructor notes.

20
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,810
And that's it, you've built
your first progressive web app.

21
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,650
Congratulations.
