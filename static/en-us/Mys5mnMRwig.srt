1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,091
Now that we've come up with this new equality. The absolute value of x minus 4

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:08,095
is greater than or equal to 4. How should we show that on a number line? I've

3
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:11,877
already selected three points for you where we may or may not need a kind of

4
00:00:11,877 --> 00:00:16,198
parenthesis or bracket. Those points are negative 1, 4, and 9. And, of course,

5
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:20,290
those were all important when we were dealing with the absolute value of x minus

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,173
4 is less than or equal to 5. So, for each of these three points, please select

7
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:28,152
which symbol belongs on the number line at that point. You'll notice I've also

8
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:32,545
drawn four boxes down here for you. One for the area of the number line to the

9
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:37,030
left of negative 1. One for the area between negative 1 and 4. One for the area

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,320
between 4 and 9 and one for the area for the right of 9. I'd like you to check

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,165
off which of these areas of the number line should be shaded in.
