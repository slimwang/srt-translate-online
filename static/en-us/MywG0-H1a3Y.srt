1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,631
So what's going on here? Does 4 equal 6? Well no, this can't be right, we know 4

2
00:00:04,631 --> 00:00:09,266
isn't equal to 6. So this substitution method isn't working, something else is

3
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:13,680
going on with these two lines. If we remember that a solution to a system is a

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,224
point of intersection, then we know that these two lines can't intercept, we

5
00:00:18,224 --> 00:00:22,957
don't get a true statement. In other words the lines have to be parallel. Let's

6
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:23,609
make sure.
