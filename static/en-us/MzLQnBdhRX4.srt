00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,180
Recalling in something we have talked about before.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,000
We've always thought about images as being functions.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,450
Now the one of the best ways to visualize that this kind of

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,140
thing is looking into this height map that we've looked at before.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,440
Here of course you can see in the 3D height map edges appear as ridges.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,760
So if you look at it when it comes around, you can see the information that

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,480
basically lets you differentiate between this part of the image and that.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,150
Something we will come back, and again, hopefully connect up to what we have

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,360
looked at in the past to what we are talking about now.
