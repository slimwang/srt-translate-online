00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Narrator] So here's a pictorial representation of a parse tree for HTML.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Remember that all parse trees always grow upside down,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and we have our actual tokens at the leaves at the bottom

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
because this is a web page that just says, "Hello friends," with no tags,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and it has a large number of intermittent nodes corresponding to non-terminals

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
or rewrite rules in our grammar.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We want to walk over this parse tree and decide based on all these intermediate nodes

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
to print out to display on the screen as our web page Hello Friends.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That process is known as interpreting.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Walking over the tree to figure out what to do, and in some sense

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
it's just like interpreting a sentence in English to figure out what it means

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
or even translating a sentence from one language to another.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Recall that our 2 major elements in our syntax tree are represented in python as tuples.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Word elements just have 2 parts, the word word-hyphen element so that we know what's going on,

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and then the actual text from the user, and tag elements which start with tag elements.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Again, to make it easier for us to interpret, we'll see that in just a minute.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The beginning tag, the ending tag, and then down here a list of other elements.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We also have a Java script element, which I haven't spent as much time talking about,

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but is our way of representing embedded Java script pieces of code in a web page.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We're going to focus on these 2 for now.
