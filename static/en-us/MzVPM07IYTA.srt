00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,410
So so far we've learned
that the AudioManager class

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,880
in the Android Framework allows
us to request audio focus

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,840
when we need to play audio.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,100
And then it allows us to also
abandon audio focus afterwards.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,640
We can also register
a listener to get notified

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,040
when the audio focus state changes.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,120
Now this means that we'll
need an AudioManager

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,910
object instance of our activity so
that we can manage Audio Focus.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,720
If we take a look at this audio
focus tutorial, the section labeled

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,365
Managing Audio Focus, it says that
we can use this line of code.

11
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:39,120
Context.getSystemService with
an input of AUDIO_SERVICE.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,360
In order to get an instance
of Audio Manager class.

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,360
Now from this line of code, we see that
the Audio Manager is a system service.

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,940
Well this is the first time we've
heard about system services.

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,800
So there exist system services
that provide all apps

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,890
with common functionality.

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,600
So things like notification service,
or of the alarm manager service.

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,320
And there are some services
that allow us to access

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,300
hardware components on device such
as the location manager service.

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,180
But at the end of the day, a system
service is just a Java class and you can

21
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,540
interact with it by having an object
instance and then calling methods on it.
