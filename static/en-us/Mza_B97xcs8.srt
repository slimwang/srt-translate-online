1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,990
So one of the big differences that comes
from direct manipulation screens, that

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:09,720
is things you touch to provide input
versus what we have in the desktop and

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,492
laptop world, is that the human body
all the sudden really starts to matter.

4
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:16,350
Before when we're building software for
desk tops and

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,670
laptops the size of our hands,
the size of our finger what's

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,940
a comfortable reach, that burden is
taken on by the keyboards and the mice.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,870
Right so
long as the mouse is comfortable and

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,240
the keyboards comfortable the software
designer doesn't have to worry about it.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,080
They don't have to think about
these are going to considerations.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,580
As soon as software is something
that people can touch and

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,600
feel, the screen has to be considered
in the context of your hand.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,460
How far can you reach that thumb?

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,860
How big is that thumb?

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,110
These things impact
where you put controls,

15
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,230
how large you make controls and how
easily those controls are to manipulate.

16
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,050
Anyone who's struggled
with a desktop form on

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,940
a mobile device knows these teeny little
tick boxes and radio buttons can be

18
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,480
super frustrating especially if
you're trying to pick a specific one.

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,200
So at the very least we need to consider
how to size controls, how to space them.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,690
And that's sort of the bare minimum.

21
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,570
If you want to do one better then
you start thinking about well.

22
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,650
Is it possible to create this flow or

23
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,800
to complete this flow using what
I call one thumb one eyeball.

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,650
And one thumb one eyeball actually
illustrate this here since

25
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,730
I have a phone like all of you too.

26
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,580
In your pocket, kind of hold it like
this, and you look at it like this.

27
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,940
TV may be on, you may be outside,
or something like this.

28
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,070
How can I get something done,
just with these sorts of actions?

29
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,070
And that goes much broader
than just size, right?

30
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,800
It's where you place the controls,
it's what the flow looks like,

31
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,210
it's the kind of controls
you use as well.

32
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,690
And we have a lot of controls that
require the precision of a mouse cursor

33
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,390
to use well little like spinner wheels
that you find on the desktop drop

34
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,620
down menus that you find desktop.

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,030
All those controls need to be
rethought for touch screens so

36
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,800
that they can actually
be used by our hands.
