00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,190
If you're familiar with the flask
web development framework,

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,110
you should be no stranger
to the app.route decorator.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,430
This decorator in flask can be used
to make URLs to render webpages and

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,540
API endpoints alike.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,140
You should also import
the jsonify package from

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,250
flask into your application.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,875
Jsonify can convert dictionaries
into JSON objects that can then be

8
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,050
sent to the client.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,700
The jsonify function in flask
returns the flask response object

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,430
that already has the appropriate content
type header for use with JSON responses.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,880
In this next exercise,

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,350
you'll familiarize yourself with
making basic API endpoints with flask.
