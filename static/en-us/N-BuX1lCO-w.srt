00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,370
So far we have referred to machines on the internet

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,939
soley by their IP address and then its largely how the

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,480
machines address each other. But IP addresses are not very

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,200
convienant for users like you and me. We much to prefer

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,780
to use host names. The domain name system that makes

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,070
this possible amounts to another layer of indirection within the network

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:22,300
layer. The host name, like www.udacity.com, gets translated into an IP

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,490
address, which is then used in the ways we've talked about.

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,230
This translation is accomplished with the help of domain

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,450
name services sprinkled throughout the internet. Suppose I try to

11
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,040
send a packet to www.udacity.com from my computer. To

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,260
get the most authoritative answer, my computer would then ask.

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,310
The local DNS server, not too far away, probably

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,380
on the Comcast network. This in turn would ask the

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,990
root name server where it might find a .com

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,630
name server which would help it with host names ending

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,310
with .com. Having received this response, our DNS

18
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,080
server would then ask this .com name server

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,500
for information about udacity.com. When this IP comes

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,978
back The server then asks where it might find

21
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:07,860
www.udacity.com, and when it receives this answer, it

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,200
then forwards it back to my computer. This should

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,240
be somewhat reminiscent of how a directory system

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,110
works. Importantly however, high levels in the tree are

25
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,380
to the right of the host name. Hence. www.udacity.com

26
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:25,250
is sort of like / com/udacity/www. Now, of course,

27
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,560
we don't actually make all these requests every time

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,240
we need to find the IP for www.udacity.com, my computer

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,430
will cache the answer and so will the local

30
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,080
name server, not necessarily for my sake. But for

31
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,730
the sake of other clients on the same local

32
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:43,930
server who might also need an IP for www.udacity.com, and

33
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,340
they would cache the IPs for the root server, and for

34
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,480
the dot com server as well. You can read more about how

35
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,210
domain names are acquired and registered, and how the severs are

36
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,910
kept up to date, in the links provided in the instructor notes.
