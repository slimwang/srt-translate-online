1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,450
So let me show you something that,
that same group and

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:06,360
others pushed on a little bit more
recent of handling occlusion.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,580
So the question is, you know,

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,040
if, if a thing gets partially occluded,
we have this problem,

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:18,050
because you remember the Eigenface stuff
is, it's capturing the entire image.

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,290
As a vector, and

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,320
all the pixels all the components
in that vector are created equal.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,590
So if some of them are sort
of being blocked or

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,500
obscured, it's not going to
be able to explain that data,

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,689
it's not going to be able to track, give
you very high probability at that area.

11
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,390
But it turns out you can,

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,800
you can address that if you think
about the following, all right.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,920
By the way that's Greg Dudack
a while back, hi Greg.

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,790
Picture there.

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,320
When I reproduce an image, so let's
suppose I've, I've tracked this thing,

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,460
I've completed my Eigenbasis and
now I, I'm trying to find my best one,

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,970
and I do.

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:57,920
I can now say of all those pixels,
which ones am I reconstructing well?

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,570
The ones that I'm reconstructing well,

20
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,540
those are the ones that I have
a lot more confidence in.

21
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:10,210
So let me create a weight mask that
says, you know, those pixels are fine,

22
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,900
but anywhere that I find something that
I can't reconstruct well, I'm going to

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,070
highlight those pixels as ones that
I'm not going to pay attention to.

24
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,760
By the way,
the reason I'm saying highlighted is on

25
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,900
the video I'm about to show you,
for whatever reason, they have,

26
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,200
sort of, bad pixels as being bright.

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,310
So you can think of them
as being highlighted for

28
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,080
not counting as much in the current or
the next iteration.

29
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,490
So what you're going to see
here in this video again is, so

30
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,685
here's the, Greg's face.

31
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:37,170
That' s going to be tracked.

32
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,810
And this is the, sort of,
the location of what they're doing.

33
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,150
But what you'll see here is,
there'll be this black image, and

34
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,850
then, all of a sudden, you'll see
his hand swipe up across his face.

35
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:54,548
Now, of course his hand is not easily
reproduced with the face Eigenbasis.

36
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:57,260
So you're going to see that light up,
and that's it saying okay,

37
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,560
the weight of those
pixels should be reduced.

38
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,780
So let's see if this works.

39
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,450
There it goes, its playing, okay.

40
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,060
Same thing we see before.

41
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,770
You see his Eigenvectors changing
on the bottom as he rotates in

42
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,330
and out of the plane.

43
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,090
Whoops!
There was his hand.

44
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,100
Did you miss that?

45
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,980
Let go back again.

46
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,450
Now get ready, in a minute, he's
going to swipe his hand over his face,

47
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,190
there, there it goes.

48
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,370
Did you see that?

49
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,690
You can play it backwards,
as his hand came up,

50
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,410
the weights got brighter where the hand
was, saying ignore this, this place.

51
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,900
And now it tracks him for awhile.

52
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,870
He's smiling, he's getting large,
and moving around and

53
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,450
you can see it's doing
a good job tracking.

54
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,610
You can see the difference between
how well it can be reconstructed.

55
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,620
And the reason it can handle things
like this is remember the state

56
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,310
that's it's tracking is position
translation rotation scale.

57
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,800
So you can normalize it back to
the original sort of canonical view and

58
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,400
explain that view from the Eigenbasis.

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,640
All right, so
that's some pretty cool tracking work.
