As labelled on each graph, the horizontal axis represents the x values, and the

2
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:09,745
vertical axis represents the y values. From our equation, we know that even if

3
00:00:09,757 --> 00:00:15,351
no wipers were made or x equals 0, Grant would still have to spend $1,200, which

4
00:00:15,363 --> 00:00:20,615
would make y equal 100. That gives us the point 0,1200. x equals zero along the

5
00:00:20,627 --> 00:00:25,335
y-axis here. We need to find the graph that intersects the y-axis at y equals

6
00:00:25,347 --> 00:00:29,985
1,200. And that is this graph right here. The trend in the rest of the graph

7
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:34,655
makes sense as well. But every pair of glasses wipers that Grant makes, he

8
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:39,578
spends more money because our x value increases. From the equation, we can see

9
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,170
that as x gets bigger, y also gets bigger. So, the graph needs to move up and to

10
00:00:44,182 --> 00:00:44,748
the right.
