1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For this quiz, I'm going to list some properties, and you should check the box

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
for the ones that are true for the given operation mode.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So which modes require that E--the encrypt function that we've been using in the black box--

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
is invertible?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Check this box if Cipher Block Chaining mode requires this,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and check this box if Cipher Feedback Mode requires this.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Which of them require the Initialization Vector to be kept secret?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Can use small message blocks?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Which can provide strong protection against tampering,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
so Alice would be able to know if someone had changed values of parts of her file?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And the final one--that the final cipher text depends on all of the blocks in the message.
