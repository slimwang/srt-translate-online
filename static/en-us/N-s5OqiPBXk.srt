1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,900
So once you've set up
the billing account,

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:06,240
it's time to create a new project
using the Create Project button.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,940
Enter the human friendly name for
your application.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,540
I'm just going to call it My First Map.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,380
Then you enter the project ID.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,450
This ID needs to be unique across
all of Google's infrastructure, so

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,920
you'll need to get specific here.

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,040
As you can see,
I've just called it udacityfirstmap1,

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,080
because this isn't taken and
it's available.

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,420
Then you select the billing account
that' you're going to use, and

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,370
if you remember when you're
setting up the billing account,

12
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,000
you gave a profile name, and I have
a profile that I call My Cloud Project,

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,370
and I'm just billing based off of that.

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,980
Then you just click Create.

15
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,480
As you can see,
it will take a few moments creating.

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,850
But when it's done, you'll be
taken to the project dashboard.

17
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,950
Now you can see I'm on
the project dashboard.

18
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,200
So the first thing that I
want to do to enable maps,

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,540
is to go to APIs off, then select APIs.

20
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,900
And here's a number of APIs
that are available to me.

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,900
But we can see there
are Google Maps APIs here.

22
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,540
So I'm going to go to the Google Maps
Android API and I'm going to enable it.

23
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,460
Now that it's enabled, the final
step is to set up the credentials.

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,760
Over here I can click on the credentials
link, then under public API access,

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,390
I'll create a new key.

26
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,944
When it asks what type of key,

27
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:19,686
I'm going to select Android key
because I'm building an Android app.

28
00:01:19,686 --> 00:01:23,286
It will give me a dialogue asking me for
the SHA1 that I got earlier,

29
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:25,490
followed by the name of my app.

30
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,640
Because I'm not deploying this app,
or doing anything with it that would

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,430
require the certificates to check,
the restrictions are much looser.

32
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,530
And one of these is that
the name doesn't really matter.

33
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,980
But I am going to use the fully
qualified name of my app.

34
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,050
The SHA fingerprint is what we
got in terminal earlier on.

35
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,533
Let's take a look at that.

36
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:44,880
Here you can see my SHA1 key.

37
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,060
So I'm just going to copy all of that,
and then I'm going to put a semi-colon,

38
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,300
and after the semi-colon I'm
going to put the name of my app.

39
00:01:52,300 --> 00:02:00,140
In this case, it's
com.google.devplat.lmoroni.firstmap.

40
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,030
Don't worry if you need
to change the name.

41
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,280
You can do this later with the edit
allowed android applications button.

42
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,366
But, I'll just create for now.

43
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:11,360
And we can see that my
key is listed here.

44
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,490
And if I wanted to change my name,
I just say, Edit,

45
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,340
allowed Android applications.

46
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,169
And I can go ahead and change the name.

47
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:19,790
The API key is listed at the top.

48
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,880
Make a copy of that, or
keep the console open,

49
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,810
because you'll be needing
that in the next step.
