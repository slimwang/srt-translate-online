00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,110
So here is your mini project. We want you to

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,580
create your very own secret message, for a friend, or a

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,150
loved one. Now, the secret message could be anything from

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,430
you wishing them a great day to you telling them how

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,070
happy you are to have them in your life. You

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,870
can start by showing them the jumbled up version of your

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,070
message. Now, we have provided some images of the alphabet

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,010
in the instructor notes. You can use them if you'd like.

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,730
Then run the program and reveal your secret message

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,290
to your friend. Your assignment is to share videos or

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,550
photos of your friend's reaction with us on the discussion

12
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,830
forum. Once you're done, check this box before you continue.
