00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,027
Here are the methods we have learned so far to solve quadratic equations. We

2
00:00:04,027 --> 00:00:07,611
first started by reviewing factoring. Then we looked at the root method, and

3
00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:11,746
finally, we completed the square. Factoring is perhaps the easiest method if we

4
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:15,690
can factor a quadratic equation. If we can't factor it, then we'll want to use

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,008
one of these two approaches in order to get our solution. And if none of these

6
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:24,714
three methods will work, we have one last method that will always work. That

7
00:00:24,714 --> 00:00:28,760
method is the quadratic formula. There are some advantages and disadvantages to

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,174
this method. Let's see what they are. For any equation written in this form, we

9
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:37,962
can find the solutions to it by doing negative b plus or minus the square root

10
00:00:37,962 --> 00:00:45,080
of b squared minus 4ac, all divided by 2a. This is our quadratic formula and it

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,098
only requires that we know the values of a, b, and c. a is the coefficient of

12
00:00:50,098 --> 00:00:53,056
the x squared term, b is the coefficient of the x term, and c would be the

13
00:00:53,056 --> 00:00:58,680
constant term. I mentioned the pros and cons of this quadratic formula. Well,

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,276
the pro is that it can solve any quadratic equation, so long as we have the a,

15
00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:07,164
b, and c, and the left-hand side is set equal to 0. We could also have the

16
00:01:07,164 --> 00:01:10,002
equation reversed, the left-hand side could be 0 and the right-hand side could

17
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:14,564
be this. For the cons, it's actually very easy to make a sign error in two

18
00:01:14,564 --> 00:01:18,546
places. Here, we need to take the negative value of b, so if to change the

19
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:22,263
sign. The other place that we might make a sign error is underneath the

20
00:01:22,263 --> 00:01:26,580
radical. b squared should always end up being a positive number, and then we

21
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,450
have minus 4ac. Now, depending on the values of a and c, this second term might

22
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:36,033
end up being positive or it might stay negative. You'll want to pay close

23
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:39,810
attention to how many negative signs you have here to determine this number.

24
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,860
And finally, another drawback to the quadratic formula is that we have to

25
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,540
simplify. We'll need to simplify this radical. And then we'll also need to

26
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,113
simplify this fraction if we can. Sometimes, this result will end up being the

27
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:55,140
integers, and sometimes, it will end up being fractions. Keep in mind that we

28
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,070
could get imaginary solutions if we have a negative radical here.
