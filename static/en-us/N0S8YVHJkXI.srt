1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,110
Okay, let's have a quick look at the
triggers and the tags that you created.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,360
So the triggers,
the new triggers are openScreen,

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,930
which fires when the event equals
openScreen and Daily Special Screen,

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,210
which fires when the screen
name equals Show Daily Special.

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,370
So those were the triggers and
then the tag that you created.

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:25,410
We'll see, was a tag to send the Daily
Special Screen Hit to Analytics.

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,570
You created a variable for
the Analytics account ID.

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,490
The track type must be App View,
App View.

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,590
And you must set the screenName field,
must be spelled exactly this way,

10
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:41,050
to the value of the screen name
that gets set in the code,

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,020
which in our case is Show Daily Special.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,050
We only want it to fire when screen
name equals, Show Daily Special,

13
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,390
and when the event was open screen.

14
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,110
In the process of doing that you have
created the variable My Tracking ID,

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,360
which is a constant who's value
is your analytics account id.

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,930
And if you did all that,

17
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,420
you should see your hits coming into
analytics when you run your app.
