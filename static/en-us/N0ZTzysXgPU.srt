1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So this is the model that we started with.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There's a compartment of susceptible persons, a compartment of infectious persons,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and a compartment of recovered persons.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Depending on the number of infectious persons, susceptible persons become infectious,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and infectious persons automatically recover after awhile.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now, we're introducing another effect latency.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Persons who get infected should not immediately become infectious and we model this

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
by introducing another compartment--exposed persons.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Depending on the number of infectious persons and susceptible persons,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
susceptible persons become exposed--that is infected and after awhile, become infectious.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This should obviously be called the SEIR model.
