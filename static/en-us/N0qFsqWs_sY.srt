1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,420
So when you talk about
software vulnerabilities,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,970
it is affected by what
language you program in.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,870
So there's safer programming languages
compared to programming languages

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,510
that are less safe where
it's easier to make or

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,600
have bugs that can be exploited or
bugs that become vulnerabilities.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,770
So one idea is strongly typed languages.

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:30,070
They're basically every piece of data
that we have must have a type, and type

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,370
defines what you can do, what kind of
operations you can perform on the data.

9
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,700
So strongly typed
languages allow only that

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,155
operations to be performed which
are defined for their data type.

11
00:00:42,155 --> 00:00:44,350
Weakly don't care so

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:50,040
much, they may sometimes allow you to
do something that is not consistent.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,010
Java is a strongly typed language.

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,970
I should say that there is no strict
separation in terms of where strongly

15
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:03,030
ends and where weakly type starts,
but Java is strongly, C or

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,230
Python or something are not
as strongly typed languages.

17
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:13,560
So this quiz is how does strong
typed versus weak type languages,

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,670
now how do they help or hurt in terms
of software security is concerned.

19
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,130
Or whatever it is that can arise in
software that can impact its security.

20
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,180
Is it helped by strongly?

21
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,890
Certain things that we talked about here
in the options actually are relevant to

22
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,570
potential vulnerabilities.

23
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,130
This quiz question is actually asking,
how does that strongly versus weakly

24
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:43,200
typed language either make these
things possible or not possible, okay?

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,010
So if the first option, for
example you think this is possible with

26
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:54,150
strongly typed then put S, otherwise put
W, and do that for all three options.
