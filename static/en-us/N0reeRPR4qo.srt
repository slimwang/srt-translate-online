00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,216
>> All right, let's build off our knowledge from the last problem. >> We know

2
00:00:04,216 --> 00:00:08,656
that here we had an equal sign here last time, so when this was equal x had to

3
00:00:08,656 --> 00:00:12,966
be two. >> So there is one solution, but we don't have an equal sign here, we

4
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:17,336
have an in equality sign. >> So I want this right side to be larger than eight.

5
00:00:17,336 --> 00:00:21,496
>> If x was two, I get eight. >> So that means if x was any number bigger than

6
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:25,894
two, then this side would be larger than eight. >> I'm going to try plugging in

7
00:00:25,894 --> 00:00:29,650
3. >> If I plug in 3, I get 9 plus 2 on the right. >> So 8 is less than 11. >>

8
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,597
This is great. >> This is a solution that works. >> And in fact, any number

9
00:00:33,597 --> 00:00:37,468
bigger than 3 would give me a number larger than 8 when I plug in. >> So,

10
00:00:37,468 --> 00:00:41,692
there's gotta be more than one solution. >> There's not just 1 or 2, there's

11
00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:45,784
infinitely many. >> There's more than three. >> If you choose this one, nice

12
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:50,709
work. >> You might be skeptical just looking at this one solution. >> Let me

13
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:55,641
show you four. >> When I plug in 4, I get 8 is less than 12 plus 2, or 8 is less

14
00:00:55,641 --> 00:01:00,600
than 14. >> Plugging in any number bigger than 2, like 3 4 5 or even 500 would

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,467
work. >> That's why there's infinitely many solutions here.
