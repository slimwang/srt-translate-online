00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,180
So far,
you've researched browser events, and

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,230
you've taken a peek
at them being logged.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,680
Now it's time to actually listen for
and respond to them with jQuery.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,760
There are three items you need in order
to listen for events and react to them.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,530
You need the target element to listen
to, the event we want to react to,

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,320
and the actions to take in response.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,230
Let me show you an example.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,660
I need the target element that
jQuery will be listening to for

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,750
events, so I'll use jQuery
to select the input field.

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,710
Next, I call the .on() method.

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,240
This .on method is where
the magic happens.

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,469
It's the primary way the jQuery
uses to set up event listeners.

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,490
The first argument to the .on method
is the event I want to listen for.

14
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,190
In this example, it's keypress.

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,650
But it could also be click, change,
and mouseover to name a few.

16
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,360
And finally,

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,050
I need to pass a function with the
actions I want to happen in response.

18
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,282
This function is called the .callback.

19
00:00:55,282 --> 00:00:57,890
The .callback function being
passed to the .on method,

20
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,840
is just a regular JavaScript function.

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,400
And therefore, can contain
any JavaScript code you want,

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,580
from altering page content
to analytics code.

23
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,480
I'll change the contents of the function
to alter the color of the page.

24
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,404
And I'll test it.

25
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,810
Bam.
Looks good.

26
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,200
In the next quiz, you're going to
create your own event listener.
