00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, welcome back. Let's finish coding this off.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In our original description of delta debugging,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we have to increase the granularity at this point.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That is, n becomes 2n but must not become longer

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
than the current input we're working on.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Our working input here is s and must not become bigger than the length of s.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
However, if this works we simply double it.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If we have reached the total length of s,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and then we return the simplified input.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Here again we have the HTML input for which the binary search simplification

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
didn't simplify enough.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's see how delta debugging fares instead.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We click on Run.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You see the output now is simply ,

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
showing that delta debugging has managed to really minimized everything away in here.
