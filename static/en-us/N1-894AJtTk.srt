1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
And the three correct answers are faster clocks.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,917
This corresponds to our more productive digger.

3
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:09,346
More work per clock cycle—this corresponds to our super shovel.

4
00:00:09,346 --> 00:00:12,750
And more processors—this corresponds to hiring more diggers.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,318
And this is the approach that we'll be taking in this class.
