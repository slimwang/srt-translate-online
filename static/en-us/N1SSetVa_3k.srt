1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,940
So which is your favorite option to deal with edge issues?

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:09,170
Load up the image package, read an image, create a gaussian filter.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,450
Remember gaussians are special.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,650
Now when you apply it, specify an edge parameter.

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,690
Passing in zero is equivalent to the default.

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,110
You can see the black seeping in along all the edges.

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,630
This is because we passed in zero.

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,420
What happens if we put in some other number?

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,710
Try it out.

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,800
What about circular?

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,790
If you look closely, you'll see the green seeping in on this side, and

12
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,720
a little bit of red on the opposite side.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,020
Replicate.

14
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,070
Replicate is not too bad.

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,210
No obvious effects.

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,710
And lastly, symmetric, or reflect across edge.

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,680
Not bad either, actually not too different from replicate.

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,770
Feel free to experiment with these different options, filter sizes, and sigmas.
