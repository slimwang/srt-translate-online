00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] And the answer is 2mm.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
James, even though he is 2 meters tall, will look like 2mm tall in the camera.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The picture will be there's a 2 meter tall person over here who is 10 meters away,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
there's a pinhole, and the focal plane is only 10mm away from the pinhole.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So this projection will be really, really small.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's do this in math.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The upper caps X is 2 meters, the 10 meters over here is the distance, Z,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and the focal length, 10mm, is the thing over here,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
so 2 meters for X divided by 10 meters for Z times 10mm

10
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
becomes 0.2 times 10mm, which is 2mm.
