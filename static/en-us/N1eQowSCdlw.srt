1
00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:03,069
So the first algorithm that we're going to cover today is called reduce.

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:06,282
So an example of reducing a set of numbers, for example,

3
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:11,092
is adding up all the numbers in this set to get a total sum.

4
00:00:11,092 --> 00:00:15,659
Reduce is an interesting algorithm because it requires cooperating between processors.

5
00:00:15,659 --> 00:00:22,507
So here we have a tree that we can use to compute the sum of a large number of integers.

6
00:00:22,507 --> 00:00:28,303
And so it's interesting because we now have dependencies between the operations.

7
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:32,054
First, we add 1 and 2, and we have to take the result and then add it to 3.

8
00:00:32,054 --> 00:00:36,349
Then when we have that sum, we can take the result and add it to 4 and so on.

9
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:39,850
So we now have dependencies between the operations that we need to do.

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,761
And we haven't looked at any algorithms that have this behavior before.

11
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:46,661
Reduce is also interesting because a parallel implementation,

12
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:48,425
like the one that we're about to describe,

13
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:53,002
will have a smaller and a better number of steps than a serial implementation.
