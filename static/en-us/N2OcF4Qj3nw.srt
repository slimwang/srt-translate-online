1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The next important property is that it's actually secure,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and we're going to focus first on secure against a passive eavesdropper,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
so this is an adversary that can listen in on all the messages

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but can't modify them.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That means the adversary will be able to get the public values q and g.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We'll also be able to hear all the messages transmitted,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
so we'll be able to learn yA and yB,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and our goal is to be confident that the adversary

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
would not be able to learn k AB.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The question is which of these would be most convincing

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
in proving that the Diffie-Hellman protocol is secure?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The first is that showing that the number of possible xA values to guess is too high.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The second is showing that an attacker who could solve a known hard problem

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
would be able to compute the key.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And the third is showing that an attacker who can compute the key

16
00:00:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
would be able to solve some known hard problem.
