00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,530
Consider an ideal cache of
size Z equals four words.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,610
Assume that the transfer or
line size L is equal to one word.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,700
Now consider a program that consists
of the following sequence of 10 load

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,060
operations.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:19,030
Pretend that these 16 bit hexadecimal
values are word aligned addresses.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,930
Now, suppose our cache
is initially empty.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,550
Then suppose you execute
the first instruction.

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,480
It loads the value at hex address BEEF.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,360
Since the cache is empty,

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,110
the hardware can store the value at
this address somewhere in cache.

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:38,010
I've denoted that action by writing the
hex address in brackets in a cache line.

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,880
Remember that by the rules of
how an ideal cache operates,

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,960
we can assume full associativity.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,300
That means for an empty cache I could
have placed this address anywhere.

15
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,070
Here's your first task.

16
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,880
Suppose you execute the first
nine instructions, that is,

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,470
all the instructions except the last.

18
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,630
Here's my first question, what's
the state of the cache at this point?

19
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,730
That is, I want you to fill in
the addresses that would be in cache

20
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,670
after the first nine
instructions have executed.

21
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,710
You can just type the addresses in
the same notation square bracket and

22
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,800
hexidecimal address into the lines.

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,900
Now that's not all.

24
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,660
Here's your second task.

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,640
As you simulate what the cash would do,

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,200
I want you to count
the number of evictions.

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,280
Enter that value in this box.
