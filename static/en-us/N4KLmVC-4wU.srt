1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,751
You know that the derivative of 1/2 of
x squared in one dimension is simply x.

2
00:00:05,751 --> 00:00:07,663
So when you take that derivative for

3
00:00:07,663 --> 00:00:11,780
each of the components of your
vector you get the same components.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,010
Therefore, the answer is the third one.
