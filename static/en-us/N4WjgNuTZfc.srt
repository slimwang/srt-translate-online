1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Finally, I'd like to ask you what is the optimal policy for the parameters we just studied.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm listing here all states--a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, b2, and b3--

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and I'd like you to tell me whether you would like to go north, south, west, or east

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
in any of those six states over here.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For each of those there is exactly one correct answer.
