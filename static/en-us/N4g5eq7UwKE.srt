Starting at the simplest combinatorial modeling, this is the simplest form of

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:10,110
behavioral modeling, and it merely expresses the logic of simple combinatorial

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,900
systems. In these systems, only the inputs and not the history of previous

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,330
states determines subsequent states. We'll look for a second at two equivalent

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,140
forms of combinatorial modeling. Called decision trees and decision tables.
