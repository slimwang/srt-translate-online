00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,014
In 3D computer graphics, we usually use a Cartesian Coordinate System. In this

2
00:00:05,014 --> 00:00:10,586
system, we have an origin and three direction vectors called x, y, and z. The

3
00:00:10,586 --> 00:00:15,142
origin is some fixed point in space whose location everyone agrees on. This

4
00:00:15,142 --> 00:00:19,120
point can be anything. I could build a world based on the location of our

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,329
surveyor's marker, a dot drawn on a tablet, or a reference point is simply

6
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:27,316
imagined. For example, if I'm designing a great new teapot, I don't really care

7
00:00:27,316 --> 00:00:31,484
where the rest of the world is located. So, I can state that my origin is just a

8
00:00:31,484 --> 00:00:35,465
point in empty space. I might then build a the teapots model so that this origin

9
00:00:35,465 --> 00:00:39,492
point is in the center of the bottom of the teapot. Here's a prettier view since

10
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:43,730
I want you to see the 3D coordinates better. The three direction vectors define

11
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,569
the axes of the coordinate system. They are normally each perpendicular to the

12
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:52,944
other. That is, the angle here, here and here are all each 90 degrees. It's

13
00:00:52,944 --> 00:00:56,696
possible to define a coordinate system with axes that are not perpendicular but

14
00:00:56,696 --> 00:01:00,600
this is rarely done in practice. For example, finding the distance between two

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,580
points becomes a tricky concept when the axes are not mutually perpendicular.

16
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,870
Given an origin and three vectors, we can then define the location of any point

17
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:14,268
in space with a triprelative numbers. For example, this point has a triprelative

18
00:01:14,268 --> 00:01:19,724
2, 3 and 4, as it's two units along the x, three along the y, and four along the

19
00:01:19,724 --> 00:01:24,539
z. 3D vectors are described by a similar coordinate system, except that the

20
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:29,366
origin is not needed. A vector describes a motion, which again can be described

21
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:33,812
by three numbers. That is, it describes how far to move to get from one point to

22
00:01:33,812 --> 00:01:38,067
another. However, this movement is not fixed in any particular location in

23
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:43,330
space. To understand the difference, think about time. A specific time is like a

24
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,180
point. An amount of time is like a vector. It specifies a duration, but no

25
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,813
starting time is given.
