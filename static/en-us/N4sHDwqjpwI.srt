00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:06,500
The boat travels 576 miles in either direction. Great work if you found this.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,158
We can find this answer by plugging in the value of x which is 84 and take each

3
00:00:10,158 --> 00:00:14,665
of these expressions. Either expression will give us the correct answer, so

4
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:19,442
let's make sure. If we take the expression for distance for upstream and

5
00:00:19,442 --> 00:00:25,947
replace the value of x with 84, we see that the answer is 576. The same would

6
00:00:25,947 --> 00:00:31,143
be true for downstream. We replace x with 84 to get 504 plus 72 which equals

7
00:00:31,143 --> 00:00:37,357
576. This should make sense that the distances are equal. The boat travel

8
00:00:37,357 --> 00:00:42,500
downstream first and then it went back the same distance to return. So, this

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,100
supports our reasoning for how we solve the equation and we know the boat

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,390
traveled 576 miles in each direction.
