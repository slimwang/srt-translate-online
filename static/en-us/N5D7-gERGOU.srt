00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In turns out that there is one stable equilibrium and one unstable equilibrium

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and now, we will discuss the details.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's take this equation and put it in this form so it's easier to see what has to be balanced.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The force divided by the mass has to balance the deceleration by the brake.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The force can be expressed with the help of the friction coefficient, the mass of 1/4 of the car,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and the gravitational acceleration.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So this equation boils down to the following--that the coefficient of friction has to equal

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
the deceleration of the wheel over the gravitational acceleration times the ratio of the masses

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and now we can check with our diagram what this means.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If we brake with an intensity slightly below the optimum, the coefficient of friction

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
has to be on such a line slightly below its maximum value.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This has to be the value of our coefficient of friction and hence, of the right hand side.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We have two options to satisfy this equality and hence, two possible equilibria.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This value of s and this value of s. The lower one is stable. The upper one is unstable.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I just illustrate one part of the argument for that.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Imagine s was a little lower than the value of the equilibrium, then we would have less friction

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
because the coefficient of friction decreases, but if we have less friction,

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the brake acts stronger on the wheel, which means it's going to increase wheel slip

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and moving in that locking direction, which means upward.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
From the left side, this equilibrium is stable.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
When we are slightly below, this equilibrium point if you're moving up and you can argue

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
in a similar fashion that we are slightly below that point if we are moving down.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
For this point, it's the other way around.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If we are slightly below, we keep on moving down. If we're slightly above, we keep on moving up.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Once we are past that point, we inevitably run into locking a wheel slip of one

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and strictly speaking, there is a 3rd equilibrium which is stable again.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
When the wheel slip is one, that means when the wheel is locked the deceleration by the brake

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
always supersedes the force applied through friction.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We are going to stay in that locked state.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
There is a practical consequence of this--if you push the break too hard,

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
you're inevitably going to lock the wheels, which is far less than optimal.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If we really stump on the breaks, there is no equilibrium below s=1 at all.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
No matter what, we're going to end up with locked wheels.
