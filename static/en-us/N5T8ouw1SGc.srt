1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,920
So we can do restrictions other
than just equals and not equals.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,990
All of these comparison operators
work pretty much the same in

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,930
SQL as they do in Python.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,270
Equals, less than, greater than,
less than or equal to, greater than or

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,129
equal to, and not equal to.

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,850
And here's one of the questions we
answered manually by looking at

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,940
a table in lesson one.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,910
On the next page see if you can
figure out how to get the database to

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,980
do if for you.

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,920
Make sure to fetch the name column, so

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,002
we can make sure we
got the right animals.

12
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:31,100
And remember to put single
quotes around dates,

13
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,380
since we don't want the database
to treat them as arithmetic.
