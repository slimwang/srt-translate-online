00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,610
Because of the tragic effects of the lobotomy and its over use, today's psycho

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,392
surgeries are only used, as a last resource after all other therapies are

3
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:14,058
proven to be uneffective. ECT is administered by passing electric current

4
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:18,384
through the brain in a order to induce a seizure. And ECT is administered by

5
00:00:18,384 --> 00:00:22,056
placing electrodes on the head, and passing that electrical current through for

6
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:28,548
approximately one third to half a second. And the voltage ranges between 60 and

7
00:00:28,548 --> 00:00:32,950
140 volts. Now this voltage is not lethal because it's delivered to the head,

8
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:38,295
however, if that voltage were delivered to the chest it would be lethal. Early

9
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:41,943
in its use, ECT often produced fractures, because a person was experiencing

10
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:47,822
seizure and convulsions. Therefore, today patients are given a muscle relaxant

11
00:00:47,822 --> 00:00:53,173
and an anesthetic, before the ECT is administered. Thus what was once a violent

12
00:00:53,173 --> 00:00:57,199
procedure due to the convulsions, shaking, and broken bones, now only results

13
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,636
in a slight tremor because of the muscle relaxant. Now, it may typically take

14
00:01:02,636 --> 00:01:05,710
at least six to 12 sessions at ECT, before a person is relieved of their

15
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:10,620
depressive symptoms. In addition, after ECT treatment, many patients are

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,020
relieved of their depressive symptoms, which they did not experience with other

17
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:19,475
treatments. Now the exact mechanism of action or cause of why ECT is effective,

18
00:01:19,475 --> 00:01:23,450
is still not known and research continues in that area.
