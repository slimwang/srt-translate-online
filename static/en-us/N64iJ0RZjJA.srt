00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,132
So far, we focused on helping users
fill out forms faster by, well,

2
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:07,430
not filling out anything.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,500
But now, I want you to think
about your users confidence,

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,880
with good validation features.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,540
With validation,
you can ensure that users know

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,950
that they are filling forms
with the right information.

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,260
More importantly,

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,620
validation can ensure that the users
fill out form correctly the first time.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,350
They won't waste time leaving an input
and submitting a form only to find

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,750
out a few seconds later that they
forgot a digit in their zip code.

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,140
With validation, you are giving
your users a real time feedback and

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,040
minimizing errors.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,440
I want to choose and new password,
and like in any good website,

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,560
I have a few rules
that I need to enforce.

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,340
Here, while i'm typing, you could
see that I'm using lowercase, and

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,609
now I understand that I need an
uppercase, as well, I need few numbers,

17
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,760
and I just passed the minimum
length of eight characters.

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,100
I'm adding some punctuation, and
only then, I'm enabling the next button.

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,652
It's worth adding that HTML file
validation or any front end validation,

20
00:01:15,652 --> 00:01:19,932
for that matter, is not a replacement
for a service side validation.

21
00:01:19,932 --> 00:01:22,611
Your websites are obviously not safe,

22
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:25,458
unless you validate
on your back end too.

23
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:28,288
The approach Cam and
I are discussing is just

24
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:33,410
a way to improve the user experience,
and to put a big smile on the faces.

25
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:39,012
In the next video, I'll show you how
to use HTML5 attributes for validation.
