00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,620
What we did here is what's called overriding a method. The eat method that we

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,170
defined in the discerning bear class replaces the eat method in the bear class

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,638
with some new behavior. That means we're replacing a method define by a super

4
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:17,990
class, the eat method defined in bear with a new method defined in a sub class.

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,610
The important property this give us is when the chase method defined in grizzly

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,011
bear calls eat. If it calls it on an instance of the discerning bear, well it

7
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:31,400
actually will use the eat method defined by discerning bear. That's why we call

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,063
it overriding.
