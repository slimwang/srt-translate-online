00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,124
Let's start with a slightly more complicated equation. 3 x plus 4 equals 2 x

2
00:00:05,136 --> 00:00:10,296
minus 1. Just like I asked you before, if I want to find the solution to this

3
00:00:10,308 --> 00:00:15,703
equation through drawing two lines that intersect one another in order to find

4
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:19,008
this value of x from their point of intersection.
