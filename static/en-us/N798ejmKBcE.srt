1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,753
Let's have a look at how to do this. In this case here we were asked to fill in

2
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:09,680
the ranges for x and y. Let's look at the picture, x moves this way starting at

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,714
0 and going up to the width minus 1. Y goes this way, also starting at 0 and

4
00:00:15,714 --> 00:00:22,180
going up to the height minus 1. That gives this loop for x and this loop for y.

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,254
We were given a formula for the distance, and we can use that down here. Here

6
00:00:26,254 --> 00:00:33,334
it is, simply using center x, center y and x, y for the two points. Now if the

7
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:37,303
distance is larger than the radius, then we should color the pixel black and

8
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,130
we're done.
