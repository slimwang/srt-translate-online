1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,910
Normally, only one program can listen
on a given port on a machine at a time.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,850
But once a program starts,
it can run threads or

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,390
child processes that handle
incoming connections on a port, or

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,320
a loop between several connections and
handle all of them.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,113
That's what a web server does to
be able to handle more than one

6
00:00:18,113 --> 00:00:19,143
connection at a time.

7
00:00:19,143 --> 00:00:21,083
NC-L doesn't do that.

8
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:24,809
It's not really a full server as such
just sort of a listener that only

9
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:26,500
accepts a single connection.

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,510
There's a standard Linux program that
you can use to find out which programs

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,619
are listening or otherwise,
using network connections.

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:37,460
The lsof program, name stands for
list open files, and

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,930
it has an option -i, to make it
list internet sockets specifically.

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,510
You'll have to run it using sudo
to give it root privileges.

15
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,066
Try that now on your Linux box.

16
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:52,020
Use sudo lsof-i and
in its output, look for

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,880
the names of programs
that are listening.

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,330
They'll say, LISTEN,
in all capitals and write them here.
