1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,731
We can write this number as 16 million, or 16 followed by six zeros. When we

2
00:00:03,743 --> 00:00:07,601
think about writing this number, this can kind of be a pain. We have a ton of

3
00:00:07,613 --> 00:00:11,599
zeros and our number's pretty big. There are other extremely large and small

4
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:15,590
numbers like 2 trillion and 48 billionths. We don't want to have to write all

5
00:00:15,602 --> 00:00:19,524
these zeros all the time, so let's figure out how we can do this differently.

6
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,562
Let's learn Scietific Notation. We don't want to have to write these zeroes all

7
00:00:23,574 --> 00:00:27,199
the time. It can be a pain. So instead, let's find another way to write these

8
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:29,185
numbers. Let's learn scientific notation.
