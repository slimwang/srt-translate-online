00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,904
Let's start thinking back to the different ways that we transformed parabolas

2
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:07,498
before. And then maybe we'll be able to generalize this to work with other

3
00:00:07,498 --> 00:00:11,618
functions. As we've seen so many times before, here's the graph of f of x

4
00:00:11,618 --> 00:00:15,844
equals x squared. What would happen to our graph though, if we changed the

5
00:00:15,844 --> 00:00:20,522
equation? For example, let's say I want to change it to f of x equals x squared

6
00:00:20,522 --> 00:00:25,408
minus 2. What direction would the graph shift in? Up, down, left, or right, and

7
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:27,170
by how many units?
