1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,102
I know 4 squared is really 16, and 5 squared is really 25. I know 16 plus 25

2
00:00:05,114 --> 00:00:10,332
makes 41. So, I have a total area 41. For the blue side, I have 20 plus 16 plus

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:15,771
20 plus 25. When I add all these areas together, I get an area of 81. This makes

4
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:21,110
sense because I know if I would have just combined the sides, I would have had

5
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:25,515
9, and then I would've squared it. 9 squared is 81. I know these two numbers are

6
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:30,205
not equal. We want to be really careful. Exponents cannot distribute over sums

7
00:00:30,217 --> 00:00:34,325
or differences. We can't just say 4 plus 5 squared is the same thing as 4

8
00:00:33,857 --> 00:00:37,547
squared plus 5 squared. This is a key concept that we will come back to later. I

9
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:41,975
just want to preview it for now and give you an idea of area models. This is

10
00:00:41,987 --> 00:00:45,875
going to help us problem solve. Now, let's have you practice with some

11
00:00:45,887 --> 00:00:46,485
exponents.
