00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,260
Here's the data. This party column is the time after or before eight o'clock,

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:11,310
when the party starts, that you would arrive. If you arrive thirty minutes

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,860
before the party starts, so at seven thirty, then the value you get is negative

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:21,842
30. If you arrive an hour after the party starts at nine o'clock then your

5
00:00:21,842 --> 00:00:26,520
value would be 60. When you make the chart, you're going to have to select

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:38,101
ranges. Since age is in column c, we want c1 to c62 then add another range. And

7
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:48,368
we want party I want i62. We also want to look at pets e1 to e62. So here we

8
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:53,066
have our scatter part. It looks like party is really spread around and pets

9
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:58,737
remains kind of consistent. It might be easier to visualize each of these

10
00:00:58,737 --> 00:00:59,790
separately.
