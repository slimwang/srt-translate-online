1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,390
Emily, you know what bothers me more than anything?

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,410
>> What's that, RJ? >> Jittery GPS tracks. >> Yeah, I hate Jittery..

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,750
>> What's jittery GPS tracks? >> Well, you know,
is when the GPS tracker has low accuracy,

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,630
and seems I'm driving on the side of the road,

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,710
it drives me crazy. I mean, why can't they
just know that I'm driving on a

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,970
particular Road?

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,310
>> Why's it always gotta be so jittery? >> Well, RJ,
I know the perfect solution to

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,310
your problem.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,579
>> Have you heard of the Google Maps roads
API? >> No, but tell me more.

10
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:39,270
Well, the roads API takes in those
questionably accurate GPS points, such as

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,800
these jittery points around Munich
Germany on the Blumen straße and

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,38
Frauen straße, and snaps them to the road
that you are most likely on. You simply

13
00:00:50,39 --> 00:00:55,920
pass in up to a hundred of these jittery
GPS coordinates, and poof, the roads API

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,109
returns a similar set of data with the
points snapped to the most likely road the

15
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,850
vehicle was traveling along.

16
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,200
Optionally, you can request that the
points be interpolated, resulting in a

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,650
path that smoothly follows the geometry
of the road.

18
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,490
>> Are you serious? That's amazing! >> I know,

19
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,789
think of all the fleet tracking and ride
sharing applications that could benefit

20
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,80
from something like this.

21
00:01:19,80 --> 00:01:24,30
>> And guess what? >> What? >> There's more! >> what?
>> With the roads API you can also get back

22
00:01:24,30 --> 00:01:28,229
posted speed limit data for a particular
Road segments. >> That is super useful,

23
00:01:29,9 --> 00:01:34,110
now you can identify vehicles that might
be speeding. >> Exactly, remember, the roads

24
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,630
API is only available as a web service,

25
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,289
also, it's important to note that this
date is only available to Premium plan

26
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,560
customers, so the API key that you
generated and your newly created

27
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,860
developers project won't work for these
types of requests.

28
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,140
Let's test out a few speed limit data
requests. This is a snap to roads request,

29
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,450
so will input the required parameters,
which is our path, a set of eight jittery

30
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,70
GPS points. And we'll set interpolate to
"true".

31
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,579
We are also including our API key, of
course.

32
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,690
What we get back is a set of nicely
fitted points, which if I plot them will

33
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,650
appear right along a road, as you can see
we get back way more than eight points

34
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,590
because we've interpolated to get many
more points.

35
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,900
This on the other hand, is a speed limits
request. We still pass in a path which

36
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,990
consists of GPS points and our API key.

37
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,160
What we get back is speed limit data
about points along that route.

38
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,670
Keep in mind that these are specifically
web services,

39
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,210
there isn't an equivalent service within
our JavaScript API.

40
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,400
However, if you're running a delivery
service or taxi hailing app,

41
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,400
this can be really useful in getting you
accurate location data.

42
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,970
Wow, that was some really cool stuff,

43
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,690
thanks for solving my GPS problem, now
let's go get some ice cream.
