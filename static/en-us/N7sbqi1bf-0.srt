1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer here is that this one makes sense, at least in principle,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
this one here, this one here, this one here, and this one here.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The reason why the other three don't make sense is that you have uncovered edges.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So here you have an uncovered edge which is not good,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
here you have an uncovered edge which is not good,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and here you have even two uncovered edges.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So there are only five cases that, in principle, seem to make sense.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So this would suggest that, in a search tree,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
we would have five possible assignments,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but, actually, we can even do a little bit better.
