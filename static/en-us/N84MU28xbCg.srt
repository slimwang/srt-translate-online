00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,470
Now let's find the sum of squares for within subject variability. This one's a

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,670
little harder. We take the sum of each value and subtract the respective mean.

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:16,104
Then square it. Then we add them all together. This is a little trickier. You

4
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:22,162
need to calculate each deviation of each value from the respected mean. Square

5
00:00:22,162 --> 00:00:27,540
them and then add them all up. Do the same for every sample. And then add up

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:33,014
each sum of squares. You're welcome to enter your calculations here, but that

7
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:37,810
part won't be graded. Only the complete sum of squares for within groups will

8
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,130
be graded.
