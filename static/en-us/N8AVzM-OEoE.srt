1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,955
You narrowed down the relationship between loudness and distance to two

2
00:00:02,955 --> 00:00:06,526
different graphs in the last quiz. So I'm just going to go ahead and tell you

3
00:00:06,526 --> 00:00:10,465
that this one shows the actual relationship between these two quantities.

4
00:00:10,465 --> 00:00:15,386
Loudness varies as 1 over the distance from the source of the sound. Now, if

5
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:19,412
you wrote these with more standard mathematical variables, x and y, you'd have

6
00:00:19,412 --> 00:00:24,095
the equation y equals 1 over x. We actually worked with this in the last

7
00:00:24,095 --> 00:00:27,563
lesson, and this is an example of a rational function.
