1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,795
So I think the best answer is the second choice, that we should make really sure

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:07,564
that we understand the problem before we progress on trying to solve it. I'll

3
00:00:07,564 --> 00:00:11,036
talk next on what it means to understand a problem and how to do that, but let

4
00:00:11,036 --> 00:00:14,583
me go through the other answers before. It's often tempting to start writing

5
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:18,264
code too early. Writing code is fun and that's what we like to do as programmers

6
00:00:18,264 --> 00:00:21,529
and computer scientists. The problem with starting to write code before we

7
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:24,430
understand a problem, is we might write the wrong code. We might get very

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,400
frustrated trying to write code before we really understand the problem or how

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,540
to solve it. Or we might end up writing a lot of code that doesn't actually

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,735
solve the problem we wanted to solve. The third choice is actually a very good

11
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:37,006
answer, if this weren't a practice problem. If it's a practice problem, you're

12
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:40,030
going to learn a lot more by trying to solve it yourself than finding an

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,124
existing answer. And then maybe understanding the answer, you'll still learn

14
00:00:43,124 --> 00:00:46,594
something. You'll learn a lot more by trying to solve things yourself. If it

15
00:00:46,594 --> 00:00:49,909
weren't a practice problem and you just wanted to solve this, and move onto the

16
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:53,269
next thing, searching to see if someone has already solved the problem. And for

17
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:56,519
a problem like this, probably there are good solutions out there already, is a

18
00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:59,856
better use of your time than writing your own solution. Unless your goal is to

19
00:00:59,856 --> 00:01:03,329
learn something by writing your own solution. The fourth place to start working

20
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,776
on an algorithm also depends on understanding the problem. Until we understand

21
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:09,399
the problem well, we don't know what algorithm we need to create.
