1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,160
Current Procedural Terminology, CPT,
is maintained and updated annually

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,330
by the American Medical Association
to classify all medical procedures.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,070
And it is required for
virtually all billing and reimbursement.

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,360
CPT codes are divided
into three categories.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,637
Category I codes are widely
performed procedures.

6
00:00:24,637 --> 00:00:31,080
And are 5 digits long divided
into sections for anesthesiology,

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,740
surgery, radiology, pathology,
laboratory medicine, and medicine.

8
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,702
Category II codes are for
the collection of quality and

9
00:00:41,702 --> 00:00:44,642
performance metrics and are 4 digits.

10
00:00:44,642 --> 00:00:47,524
Category III codes are for new or

11
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:52,330
experimental procedures and
are also 4 digits.

12
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:57,780
For each code there are full, medium,
and short names or descriptions,

13
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,590
as you can see here for
flu vaccine, influenza vaccine.

14
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,760
These are used for
different purposes and

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,840
provide varied levels
of detail as needed.

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,370
Given it's used for billing,
a CPT code may need to provide

17
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:18,260
details necessary to
determine the proper charge.

18
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,770
Here, we see a series of codes for
a psychiatry visit.

19
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,730
Different codes are used to
indicate the visit length.

20
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,580
The charge would be more for
longer visits.

21
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,620
These codes are used to indicate
how much dead, damaged or

22
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,170
infected tissue has been
removed to promote healing.

23
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:41,840
Removing more results
in a larger charge.

24
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,300
CPT codes are simple but
given this critical role in billing and

25
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,660
subtleties such as these, selection
of the right code is important and

26
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,730
billing personnel are extensively
trained to code correctly.

27
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,389
Typically, to ensure that the largest,
but hopefully legitimate,

28
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:01,450
bill is submitted.
