00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,877
Here I have angle A and angle B. We call the angles by their vertex. The point

2
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:09,917
right here at the corner of each angle is the vertex. But we're not so concerned

3
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,364
with that. We're going to look at the angle measures. Angle A is going to

4
00:00:14,376 --> 00:00:19,287
measure 30 degrees and angle B is going to measure 60 degrees. A and B are said

5
00:00:19,299 --> 00:00:24,259
to be complementary angles. Why do you think that is? What do you think this

6
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:29,018
work complementary means? Let's see if you can figure it out. So if C and D are

7
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,813
complementary angles, and E and F are complementary angles, what do you think D

8
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:38,633
and F measure? Type your answer in here and don't worry about the degree symbol,

9
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,372
I've already put it for you.
