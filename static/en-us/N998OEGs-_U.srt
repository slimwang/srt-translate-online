1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,080
Of the four pairs of logs down here, there are only two sets that we can

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:11,800
combine. Log base e of 4 plus ln of 5, and log base 10 of 5 plus log base 10 of

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,505
6. The reason that both of these can be combined in the product property is

4
00:00:15,505 --> 00:00:20,830
because the bases are the same for the two logs we're trying to add. Here, we

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:27,080
have log base e and natural log. But we know that ln is actually shorthand for

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,300
log base e. So both of these actually have the same base and we can combine

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:37,272
them. The same is true for the logs down here. Log base 10 of 5 and log base 10

8
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:41,430
of 6, have the same base. Since remember, that's the number that goes down here

9
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,610
as the subscript of log. The two remaining choices can't be combined because

10
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,485
the bases of the logs we're trying to add are different. Here we have log base

11
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:57,540
10 and natural log, which, again, has a base of e. 10 and e are not the same

12
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,860
number. So, we can't combine these. The same concept applies here. We have a

13
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,029
base of 2 and a base of 10, so we can't use the product property.
