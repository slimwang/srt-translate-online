00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,370
How do we go about realizing the dependency inversion principle for

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,180
the coffee maker example? First, we express what we have done so far as

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:12,320
abstract classes. Then we subclass each of them for the mark four. The subclass

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,590
versions implement the abstract methods by calling the coffee makers API.

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,050
Also the subclasses, when communicating with, with each other, use call to,

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:26,460
calls to the abstract methods not to the specific versions for the mark four.
