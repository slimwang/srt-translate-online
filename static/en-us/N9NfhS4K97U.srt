00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,734
Okay, so here's a quiz.

2
00:00:01,734 --> 00:00:05,458
Like I said, if you have every thread in a CUDA program executing the same program,

3
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:09,012
you can end up with a lot of parallel launches unless you do something about it.

4
00:00:09,012 --> 00:00:16,693
So what do we need to add to this program in order to make sure only the first thread launches this kernel?

5
00:00:16,693 --> 00:00:20,693
I've given you a hint at the bottom; see if you can figure it out.
