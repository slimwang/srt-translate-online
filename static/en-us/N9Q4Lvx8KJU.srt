00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,030
Let's discuss the machine
learning based approaches.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,480
Machine learning approaches can
automatically build a model

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,450
using the labeled normal training data.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,290
That is, a machine learning algorithm

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,130
fixes input examples of normal data and
outputs a model.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,260
That is then able to classify
subsequently observed data

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,340
as either normal or anormalous.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,830
Machine learning base models can
automatically handle small changes or

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,430
variations in the observed data.

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,300
It can also capture
the inter-dependencies or

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,940
the deeper connections between
the measures of the observed data.

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,160
On the other hand for these approaches
to be effective the normal training data

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,610
must be representative of
normal behaviors otherwise

14
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:53,500
when we apply the model to detection
there could be a lot of false positives.

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,790
In addition in the training phase
it required a lot of data and

16
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,463
a lot of of power.

17
00:01:00,463 --> 00:01:05,269
However, once the model is produced
subsequent analysis is typically,

18
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,230
fairly efficient.
