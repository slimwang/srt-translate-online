1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,885
So definitely, the time of day that you took the test could have influenced your

2
00:00:03,897 --> 00:00:07,712
memory. If you're taking the test late at night, you might be really tired, or

3
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:11,431
maybe your brain just doesn't work in the morning, like one of my friends. He

4
00:00:11,443 --> 00:00:15,125
can't think at all in the morning. That isn't to say that it definitely did

5
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:18,927
influence your memory, but it could have. The number of palm trees in Hawaii

6
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:22,980
isn't very plausible to have influenced your memory. Your stress level

7
00:00:22,992 --> 00:00:28,133
definitely could have influenced your memory. If you're really stressed, maybe

8
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:33,269
you don't remember as well. The price of milk, not so plausible. The five minute

9
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:38,380
breaks? Absolutely. If you didn't take the five minute breaks, my hunch is that

10
00:00:38,392 --> 00:00:43,930
it might be more difficult to remember which face was from part 1 or part 2. The

11
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:50,055
Mass of Pluto, not so much. Your age? Definitely. And finally, not paying

12
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:56,460
attention, definitely could have influenced your memory. And the BBC study

13
00:00:56,472 --> 00:01:01,945
concluded that age and time of day were the two biggest influencers on how well

14
00:01:01,957 --> 00:01:06,658
people performed on this memory test, if you didn't get a chance to see the BBC

15
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,321
test results. So, we're looking at a bunch of different things that could have

16
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:15,800
influenced your memory, including sleep. We make hypotheses all the time,

17
00:01:15,904 --> 00:01:16,252
everyday.
