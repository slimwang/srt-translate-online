00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,332
Now we're ready to go to work with our, our actual object design.

2
00:00:04,332 --> 00:00:07,930
We have now used all of the use cases to describe the behavior of

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,990
the three classes that comprise the coffee maker.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,240
One approach we could take

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,030
to going forward would be to implement the described behaviors as

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:22,170
methods in each of the classes by having them call to the hardware API.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,950
That is that, remember the Java code that we had that gave the API to

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,770
the hardware pieces of the system?

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,560
However, Martin says that this would be the wrong approach.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,790
Can you think why that might be the case?

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,170
And as a hint here, think about reuse.
