00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,098
So this problem may or may not have thrown
you off a little bit, because as we can

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,210
count, there are 3 terms inside these
parentheses and in the problems we've done

3
00:00:08,222 --> 00:00:12,226
before. And in the rule that I wrote up
here you only saw 2 terms added together.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,648
However it does not matter how many terms
are inside a parentheses a multiplication

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,276
is still going to distribute to every
single one of them. So in this case the 3

6
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:27,575
is going to multiply the x^2 and also the
5x and also the -7. So let's write that

7
00:00:27,587 --> 00:00:34,081
out. So distributing 3 to each of these
terms, we get 3x^2+3(5x)+3(-7), and then

8
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:00,000
we can simply within each term. And we get
a final answer of 3x^2+15x-21.
