1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,330
If we subtract expected values from observed values, we could get positive or

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,125
negative. But then we square it, so the numerator will always be positive.

3
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:16,540
Frequencies are also always positive. We can't get negative ten of something.

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:22,610
Negative ten successful climbs. That doesn't really make sense. So, all of

5
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,910
these values will always be positive. And then you'll just sum up positive

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,255
values. Therefore, chi-squared statistics are never negative. And just like the

7
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:37,054
F-test, this means that it's one-directional, in the positive direction. This

8
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:41,800
is what the chi-squared distribution looks like. And again, we have a chi

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,900
squared critical value here denoted by chi squared star. That cuts off a

10
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,060
certain probability. Remember that the total area under this probability

11
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:57,600
distribution is 1 or, 100%. And just like we've been doing with all of our

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,560
other tests, we want to find the critical value that cuts off a certain

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:09,070
probability as defined by our alpha level, 0.05 or 0.01. In this class we've

14
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,069
been using 0.05.
