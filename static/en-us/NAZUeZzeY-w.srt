1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well, if you'll permit me to doodle over our grammar,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
one way to get started with this is to think about what's in chart[0]

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
These two are in chart[0]:

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(T --> dot p Q r)

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and (T --> dot p Q s), and we have seen anything yet.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So if we start from that, in chart[0],

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the only operation we can do is to

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
shift to get to chart position [1].

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Shift over the input <p> if that's actually the first character of the input.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, it totally is--that's super convenient.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So we're going to move these dots over here and get:

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
(T --> p dot Q r) and (T --> p dot Q s)

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
from zero, in chart state[1].

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh--so both of the first two are correct.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Now we're going to have dots in front of the (Q).

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So we're going to bring in (Q --> dot q)

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
from 1, in chart position 1.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Now we're going to look at the input again

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and see that the next token is actually (q).

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So we're going to shift over this

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and put the result in chart[2].

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So in fact, this one's correct as well--wow, we're on a roll!

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now the last 2 involve doing reductions.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We see: (Q --> q) and we've seen all the input we need

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
by the time we're in chart state [2].

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Zero, 1, 2. We've seen 2 characters for the input.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So we're going to go back

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
to states that had a dot in front of a big (Q)

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and say: we have found your big (Q) and we're done with it.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So chart[1] had a dot in front of a big (Q).

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We'll conceptually shift over it

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and chart[2] will now have the dot after the big (Q).

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And another way to interpret this is:

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
after seeing 2 characters in the input, we could be here.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well the first character is (p)--great.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And the second character is little (q),

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
which we reduce up to big (Q) so, yeah--

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
this is totally where we are; my finger is right there,

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
starting from zero, with no more hidden tokens on the left.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, in fact, both of these are also right.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We will do the reduction

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and do this sort of pretend shifting,

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
for this first rule,

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and also for the second rule.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In general, we do all the shifting,

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
all the reductions, all the closures possible.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Boy, it's a good thing we're going to have a computer program do this for us

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
because doing it, by hand, is starting to get long.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This was a particularly tricky quiz,

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
so don't feel bad if you missed a few of these.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
In the end, though, all of them were right.
