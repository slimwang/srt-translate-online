00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,108
You've just seen how to step over each of these lines. But it didn't really

2
00:00:04,108 --> 00:00:07,126
show us where the program misbehaved. The hard part goes on in this

3
00:00:07,126 --> 00:00:11,164
countSyllables method. So we want to get inside it. For that we need to use the

4
00:00:11,164 --> 00:00:15,416
second step button, the step into button. Let me restart the program and do

5
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:19,745
just that. Here we are again at the first line of the program, we enter the

6
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:23,775
input again, we step over the constructor, and now, going to hit the step into

7
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:30,010
button, and that opens up the Word class. Then we have to look around a bit to

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,494
find the arrow. We're right now, here. Now we can keep stepping, and that gets

9
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:39,480
us through the lines of countSyllables. So the point is, you use step to stay

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,830
within the same method, and step into to go inside a method. Now all that

11
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,130
stepping can get tedious and sometimes it's better to set more break points and

12
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:53,810
run the program at full speed until one of them gets hit. Let's practice that.

13
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,474
You see this line where it says count plus plus? Set a break point by clicking

14
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:01,618
here and now go ahead and restart the program. You'll hit the first break point

15
00:01:01,618 --> 00:01:06,004
in main. When you hit it, click the Continue button. So that your program

16
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:09,660
continues at full speed. Supply the same input, and then your program will wake

17
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,155
up at this break point. Hit Continue again and keep doing that, and tell me how

18
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:17,400
many times you get the this break point.
