The graph of f inverse is the reflection in the line y equals x of the graph of

2
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:09,960
f. If we draw the line y equals x on our graph over here, we can see that it

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,220
cuts the picture in half. This half is identical to this one, just a mirror

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,574
image. This part of the original function also matches perfectly with this part

5
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:24,924
of its inverse. The statement that we have over here that f inverse is the

6
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:28,582
reflection in the line y equals x of f is actually true of any function of

7
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:34,814
inverse, not just these two lines. This is a result of the fact that inverses

8
00:00:34,814 --> 00:00:39,927
are the same equations just with x and y switched. It always amazes me to see

9
00:00:39,927 --> 00:00:44,508
how relationships between graphs reflect relationships between equations.
