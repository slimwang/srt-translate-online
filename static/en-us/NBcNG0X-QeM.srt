1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,920
So we talked about how the internet satisfies

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,440
the goals of sharing and interconnection and now

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,560
let's talk about some of the other goals

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,610
that are discussed in the DARPA Design Philosophy

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,730
Paper. As we discuss some of these other

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,750
goals it's worth considering and thinking about how

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,970
well the current internet satisfies these other design

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,660
goals in the face of evolving application threats and

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,930
other challenges. One of the goals discussed is survivability,

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,970
which states that network should continue to work if

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,230
even some device is fail, are comprised, and so

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,760
forth. There are two ways to achieve survivability. One is

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,710
to replicate. So one could keep state at multiple

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,470
places in the network, such that when any node

15
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,130
crashes there's always a replica or hot standby waiting

16
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,930
to take over for the failure. Another way to design

17
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,130
the network for survivability is to incorporate a

18
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,690
concept called fate sharing. Fate sharing says that

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,720
it's acceptable to lose state information for some

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,190
entity, if that entity itself is lost. For example,

21
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,960
if a router crashes all of the state on the router, such as the routing tables,

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,300
are lost. If we can design the network

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,720
to sustain these types of failures, where the state

24
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,650
of a particular device shares the fate

25
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,540
of the device itself, then we can withstand

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,950
failures better. So fate sharing makes it easier

27
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,620
to withstand complex failure scenarios and engineering is

28
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,300
also easier. Now it's worth asking whether

29
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,130
the current internet still satisfies the principle of

30
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,090
fate sharing. In a subsequent lesson, we'll talk

31
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,520
about network address translation and how it violates

32
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,330
the notion of fate sharing. There are other examples where the

33
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,160
current internet's design violates fate sharing

34
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,100
and it's worth thinking about those.
