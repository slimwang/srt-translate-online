1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,270
Well so,
let's look at some quiz questions.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,020
The first one is
the Electronic Frontier Foundation

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,710
is concerned about online privacy.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,290
And one thing it does,
it ranks websites with privacy scores,

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,450
and the scores are really
based on how do they deal with

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,990
some of the things we discussed
should go in a privacy policy.

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:29,550
So if we look at,
there is a link that you can go look at,

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,350
at the 2015 scores for
major U.S. companies.

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,540
And one of them is AT&T,
who gets just one out of five stars.

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,260
So that's a really low score.

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,290
So this lowest score is
explained by a number of things

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,510
that its privacy policy doesn't address.

13
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,410
So I have three options here.

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,870
Check all that you think could be the
reasons for AT&T's score being so low.
