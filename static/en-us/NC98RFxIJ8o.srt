1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,780
Now it's time to modify our application.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,370
And before I do this, I'm going to suggest, that you

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:11,240
initialize a Git repository, so you can always revert any mistakes you make.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,750
I always do this.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,890
In my case, when I got the code base from GitHub, I made that repository.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:18,890
And sure enough.

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,350
I'll use PWD to see that I'm on the desktop inside of my to do folder, and

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:28,030
I can say, get status, and sure enough, there is a give repository.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,490
Get log, shows me that it turns out I've actually made some commits.

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,270
Now if you do this, you'll see my commits as well.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,120
You won't see any commits by yourself, because you haven't made any yet.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,890
But as you make changes, if you like the changes you make.

13
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,690
Go ahead and use get to make commits and keep track of whats going on.

14
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,970
I'll type queue here.

15
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,483
Now if you really want to you can skip the git steps steps but

16
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:56,260
I highly recommend learning it at some point.

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,864
If you don't already know it Udacity is a version and

18
00:00:59,864 --> 00:01:03,990
there are tons of other good resources around the web as well.

19
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,020
Using version control means, its easy to experiment and

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,530
that's the exciting thing.

21
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,430
We're not going to mess up our application accidentally.

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,060
Since gits, our version control system, is keeping track of what we change and

23
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,920
when, we can play with code without fear.

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,190
If we mess up, we just ask git to revert our changes and we try again.

25
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,185
Now, I've already initialized my repo, but if you have to initialize a repo.

26
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:30,240
Git init is the command that you'll use.

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,480
I just wanted to point that out,

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,750
because this is my favorite command because it rhymes.

29
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,880
Get init.

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,750
Now, enough about get.

31
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,400
Our first feature modification will be a simple one.

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,700
We need to make it so that way, to do items that are marked as completed.

33
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,440
Show dash dash, done at the end.

34
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,560
Now, there are lots of ways you can make this happen, but

35
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,850
some art much cleaner and simpler than others.

36
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,740
Here's a good way of going about it.

37
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,940
Before you start, ask yourself a couple questions.

38
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,660
Should this change the way data is stored, or is it only a cosmetic change?

39
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,210
I like to consider that profound or cosmetic changes.

40
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,460
Is this a big change, or is it just the way it's visualized or shown?

41
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,310
Another question to ask yourself is, where could this change be implemented?

42
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,460
The view file?

43
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,740
The template?

44
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,700
Where?

45
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,930
And lastly, but most importantly in my mind.

46
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,810
Is there something already like this?

47
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,310
Does something already happen visually, when an item is marked complete?

48
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:35,310
If so, like for example the check mark, where is that implemented?

49
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,260
Maybe you should implement your change,

50
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,180
in the same place that this change happens.

51
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,240
Be a detective.

52
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,480
When you're done, we'll continue.
