So, the fifth and final personality dimension we nave is neuroticism. And

2
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:09,401
neuroticism is the tendency to experience negative emotions easily. Like fear,

3
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:14,930
anxiety, sadness and depression. And it's also the tendency to be high strung

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,824
under pressure. On the other hand, low neuroticism involves being cool, calm,

5
00:00:19,824 --> 00:00:24,369
and collected, especially under pressure. Now, let me be clear. Neuroticism is

6
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:27,645
not the same thing as neurotic. In fact, it's only the top one or 2% of the

7
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:33,300
people in neuroticism who might be diagnosed as being neurotic.
