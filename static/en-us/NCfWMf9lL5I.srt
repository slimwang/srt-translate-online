00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here is a diagram of the state space for the vacuum world.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Note that there are 8 states, and we have the actions connecting the states

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
just as we did in the Romania problem.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now let's look at a path through this state.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let's say we start out in this position,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and then we apply the action of moving right.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Then we end up in a position where the state of the world looks the same,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
except the robot has moved from position 'A' to position 'B'.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now if we turn on the sucking action,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
then we end up in a state where the robot is in the same position

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but that position is no longer dirty.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's take this very simple vacuum world

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and make a slightly more complicated one.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
First, we'll say that the robot has a power switch,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
which can be in one of three conditions: on, off, or sleep.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Next, we'll say that the robot has a dirt-sensing camera,

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and that camera can either be on or off.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Third, this is the deluxe model of robot

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
in which the brushes that clean up the dust

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
can be set at 1 of 5 different heights

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to be appropriate for whatever level of carpeting you have.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Finally, rather that just having the 2 positions,

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
we'll extend that out and have 10 positions.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now the question is how many states are in this state space?
