1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,900
We're going to put everything, but
the data into the weather app's shell.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:10,100
The HTML contains a header,
an empty forecast card,

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,040
a dialogue for adding new cities,
and the loading indicator.

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,340
Notice that the forecast card and
the dialogue

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,570
are hidden by default and
the loading indicator is visible.

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,790
We also need to include the styles and
any images our app needs to run.

7
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,590
When designing a more complex app,
content that isn't needed for

8
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,740
the initial load can be requested
later and inCached for future use.

9
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,100
For example, we could defer
the loading of the new city dialogue

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,390
until after the first run experienced
and we have some idle cycles available.
