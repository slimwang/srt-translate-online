1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,340
>> Okay. So we've done a little bit of moving,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,390
moving stuff around, and kept the same equation of before. Remember,

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,160
our goal is to use quadratic programming to maximize this

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,370
equation. So let me talk a little bit about the properties

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,240
of the solution for this equation. So here's the first

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,910
one. It turns out that once you find the alphas that

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,730
maximize this equation, you can actually recover the W, which

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,040
was the whole point of this exercise in the first place

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,110
>> that's the little W,

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,400
not the big W

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,570
>> That's the little W, not the big W. That's right, okay?

12
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,330
>> Neat.

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,040
>> Yeah, that is kind of neat. So it's

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,760
really easy to do. And of course once you

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,480
know W it's easy to recover B. You just find the value of X, you stick it into

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,230
W, you, that you know is equal to plus 1, and then poof, you, you can find out

17
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:50,250
B. So you can recover W directly from this and you can recover B from it in sort

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,580
of the obvious way. But here are some other properties

19
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,400
that are a little bit, little bit more interesting for

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,010
you. So I want you to pay attention to two

21
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,940
things. One I am just going to have to tell

22
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,500
you, and the other I want you to think about.

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,420
So here's the one that I'm going to tell you.

24
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,840
It turns out, okay, that alpha, each of those

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,290
alphas are mostly zero, usually. So if I told you that in

26
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,740
the solution to this, most of the alphas that you come back

27
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,480
are going to be zero, what does that tell you about W?

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,000
>> So W is the sum of the data points times their labels

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,600
times alpha. And if the alpha is zero, that the corresponding data point

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,360
isn't really going to come into play in the definition of W at

31
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,160
all. So a bunch of the data just don't really factor into W.

32
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,820
>> That is exactly right. So basically,

33
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,170
some of the vectors matter for finding the solution to this, and

34
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,050
some do not. So it turns out, each of those points are

35
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,970
vectors. But you can find all of the support that you need

36
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:57,320
for finding the optimal W in just using a few of those vectors.

37
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,180
>> The non-zero alphas.

38
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,410
>> Yeah, well the ones with non-zero

39
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:05,350
alphas. So you basically built a machine that

40
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,500
only needs a few support vectors.

41
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,380
>> Oh. So the, the data points for which

42
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,460
the corresponding alpha is non-zero, those are the support vectors?

43
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,630
>> Yes, those are the ones that provide all the support

44
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:22,330
for W. So knowing that W is the sum over a

45
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,270
lot of these different data points, and their labels, and the

46
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,560
corresponding alphas, and that most of those are zeroes, that implies,

47
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,530
that only a few of the X's matter. Now Michael, let me let me do a quick quiz.

48
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,190
>> Yea, yea!
