1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In real life, things depend on each other.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Say you can be born smart or dumb and for the sake of simplicity, let's assume

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:26,000
whether you're smart or dumb is just nature's flip of a coin.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now whether you become a professor at Standford is non-entirely independent.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I would argue becoming a professor in Standford is generally not very likely,

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
so probability might be 0.001 but it also depends on whether you're born smart or dumb.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If you are born smart the probability might be larger, whereas if you're born dumb,

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the probability might be marked more smaller.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now this just is an example, but if you can think of the most two consecutive coin flips.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The first is whether you are born smart or dumb.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The second is whether you get a job on a certain time.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And now if we take them in these two coin flips, they are not independent anymore.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So whereas in our last unit, we assumed that the coin flips were independent,

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
that is, the outcome of the first didn't affect the outcome of the second.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
From now on, we're going to study the more interesting cases where the

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
outcome of the first does impact the outcome of the second,

17
00:01:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and to do so you need to use more variables to express these cases.
