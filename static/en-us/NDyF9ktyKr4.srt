00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,168
So far in this course, we've seen the operations of addition, subtraction,

2
00:00:04,268 --> 00:00:08,525
multiplication, and division. We've also looked at some other symbols like

3
00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:13,197
parentheses and brackets. There's actually another type of symbol we're going to

4
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:17,339
learn. It looks like this. Now, I'm not, not going to tell you what this means.

5
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:21,891
We're actually going to try and figure that out together. So, let's try and

6
00:00:21,903 --> 00:00:28,033
figure this out through a story. I asked four people at Udacity how many candies

7
00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:33,591
were in a jar. The person with the closest guess got to keep the whole jar.

8
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:39,460
Here's what they said. Katie said, 743. Kogure said, 728. Andy said, 714, and

9
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:45,873
Kathleen said, 746. There are 734 candies in the jar. Knowing this information,

10
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:47,194
who won the jar?
