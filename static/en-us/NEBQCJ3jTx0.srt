00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,106
So here's the 2 pertinent things from that whole device query.

2
00:00:03,106 --> 00:00:05,681
Memory clock: 2,508 megahertz.

3
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:08,812
Memory bus: 128 bits wide.

4
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:12,282
As a quick quiz, let's ask, what's the theoretical peak bandwidth?

5
00:00:12,282 --> 00:00:15,418
And I'd like the answer in gigabytes per second,

6
00:00:15,418 --> 00:00:19,186
because that's how we'll usually hear it described.
