00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's look at a famous NP-complete problem that we didn't cover in the unit,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
called Hamiltonian paths.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now a Hamiltonian path involves visiting every vertex of a graph exactly once,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and here's an example.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's say we have the very simple graph shown right here.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, in that case, a Hamiltonian path, if we start it here--let's say we'll

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
go to this vertex, then this vertex, then that vertex.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And that is a Hamiltonian path.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We visited each vertex exactly once.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now there is another NP-complete problem called a Hamiltonian cycle

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
which is the same thing, but you have to start and end on the same vertex.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And that's actually impossible on this graph.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We can kind of start off here, but then, once we get here, there's no way

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to get back to our starting vertex.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So now let's take a look at a slightly more complicated example.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And what I'd like to know is whether this graph has a Hamiltonian path

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and, similarly, whether it has a Hamiltonian cycle.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Please check the corresponding box if it has either a Hamiltonian path,

19
00:01:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
a Hamiltonian cycle, or both.
