1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,939
So laws related to online activities

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:08,670
in particular are malicious
online activities.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,130
So, things like theft and extortion.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,500
Of course are illegal
in the physical world.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,620
We talked about data theft.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,650
Someone hacking into your computer,
walking away or siphoning off

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,680
your sensitive data, using that to take
on your identity is identity theft.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,520
Gaining access to your financial
accounts or getting credit cards and

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,810
things like that,
it could even be extortion,

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,050
from locking up your computer to
doing a denial of service attack,

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,190
saying your website won't
be up unless you pay up.

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,805
You would think those kind of criminal
things that happen in the cyber world,

13
00:00:43,805 --> 00:00:46,084
we should have laws related to those.

14
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:50,042
And we going to see that
actually is the case in the US.

15
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:53,732
The other set of laws have
to deal with copying and

16
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:56,850
distribution of digital objects.

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,390
So these digital objects are
essentially, your intellectual property.

18
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,040
It could be software.

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,070
It could be other kind of content
like music, videos and so on.

20
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,610
And if it's your intellectual property,

21
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,350
we know that in the known distal world
we do have intellectual property.

22
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,340
And we have ways to protect those.

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,890
And the way we do that is through
copyrights or patents and trade secrets.

24
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,710
So question is,
do these also apply when it comes to

25
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,280
digital objects that we access and
manipulate in the online world?

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,940
And if there are,

27
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,130
we do need to have these kind of laws,
how exactly do we apply them?

28
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,800
There's something different
about the online world

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,320
compared to the physical world.

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,010
So how exactly, for example, copying
something could be extremely easy.

31
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,580
That may not be the case
in the physical world.

32
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,640
So, if you do have we allow someone
to copyright a digital object or

33
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,800
protect it.

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,890
Well how exactly the law will be applied
is a question that you might have.

35
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,260
The other thing that, we actually not
going to talk a great deal about it,

36
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,840
is the idea of privacy.

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,370
We do all of things online.

38
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,240
So our activities online
what exactly we do,

39
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,410
what websites we visit, what services
we access, what do we search for.

40
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,740
It's very easy to collect all the kind
of information about these activities.

41
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,050
These are my activities and

42
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,980
somebody else can collect
information about what I do.

43
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,770
Are there any laws that protect me, in
terms of what kind of information could

44
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,900
be controlled, how could it be used?

45
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,430
There are actually, I said we'll get
through some of these, but not all.

46
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,900
But the idea of privacy here is that
the internet allows, it makes it

47
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,780
possible at a scale of magnitude
that we have never seen before.

48
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,120
So, the idea of Big Brother for example,
somebody knowing everything that you do,

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,910
is there something in the laws
to protect me from that?
