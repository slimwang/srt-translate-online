Here are two more tangents lines. Actually two was one of the three that we had

2
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:08,093
in the last quiz. And these two lines are tangent to two points on the curve

3
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:12,493
that have the same y value but different x values. My question is how the slopes

4
00:00:12,493 --> 00:00:17,285
of lines one and, and two compare to one another. Which of these do you think is

5
00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:22,705
correct? Do you think that m1 and m2 are equal, that m1 equals negative m2, that

6
00:00:22,705 --> 00:00:27,861
m1 equals negative 1 over m2 or that m1 equals m2 over 2? Remember that m1 is

7
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,119
the slope of line 1 and m2 is the slope of line 2.
