1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,420
Let's create a web application that
allows us to create multiple restaurant

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,150
menus without having to
change the source code.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,170
We want to be able to create menu items,
read the items we've created,

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,830
update our menu items, and
delete items from time to time.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,610
Hm, sounds like we
need to make some CRUD.

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,550
What's so special about CRUD, you ask?

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,980
Well, this four letter acronym
encapsulates all of the actions a user

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,950
does on a data-driven website.

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,430
Each time we make a new profile, post
a new status, write a new blog entry,

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,270
upload a new pic, or
add a new item to a menu,

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,130
we are creating new data to
be stored in our database.

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,640
Whenever we look through a friend's
latest tweets and pics, or

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,890
skim through our news feed,

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,230
we are reading data that was already
stored in an application's database.

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,920
When we correct the typo on
a blog post we already made,

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,840
modify the item quantity in our shopping
cart, or change our profile information,

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,160
we are performing an update on
existing information in the database.

18
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,510
And when it's time to erase that
embarrassing baby pic from our profile

19
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,470
or get rid of those items
in our shopping cart,

20
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,230
we're deleting information
in the database.

21
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,070
Virtually everything we do on the web
can be summarized with one little

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,160
acronym, CRUD.

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,590
I want you to take a look at
a few common website actions and

24
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,150
then decide what the CRUD is going on.
