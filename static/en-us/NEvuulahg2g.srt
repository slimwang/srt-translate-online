1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,230
So what exactly is exploratory data analysis. You

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,670
can check out the Wikipedia definition in the instructor

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,750
notes but simply put it's an approach to

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,710
understanding data using visualization and statistical tools. Think of

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,050
EDA as your initial interaction with data. For

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,670
example, let's say we wanted to look at a

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,080
set of cars. This data comes from the

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,480
MT cars data set, which comes with R Studio.

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,970
Now we couldn't make any sort of conclusions just

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,020
by reading through the table. It'd be pretty difficult.

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,740
So instead what we want to do is we want to

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,070
understand the distribution of the variables for things like miles

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,580
per gallon Cylinders and perhaps horse power. We might

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,440
create histograms, which we'll see later in Lesson three.

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,890
This histogram shows the distribution of weights for all

16
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,330
the cars. Or we might examine correlations between variables like

17
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,000
miles per gallon and horse power. In that case

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,740
we'd want to create a scatter plot. We'll examine these

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,100
in Lesson four. Our second goal is to assess

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,099
and validate assumptions. In which future inferences will be based.

21
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,030
So we might ask questions like which variables are

22
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,590
normally distributed. Or we might be wondering if a variable

23
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,600
is biased toward a particular value. Now this might

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,408
not be the case for our cars data set but

25
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:19,683
certainly in other cases like social behavior or users

26
00:01:19,683 --> 00:01:22,560
interacting on the web you might find that. Third

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,550
you might want to understand the data before performing

28
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,560
and intelligent hypothesis. Well EDA can be the source of

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,140
an idea for an experiment. It's not a formal

30
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,160
process of hypothesis testing and

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,190
predictive modelling. Ultimately, we're developing

32
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,570
intuition of our data set and how it came

33
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,560
into existence. By examining our data we can generate better

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,560
hypothesis, determine which variables have the most predictive power.

35
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,870
And select appropriate Statistical tools, to build our predictive models.
