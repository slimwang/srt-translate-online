00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,636
If you take a look at our JSON file, this is where the layer data exists to

2
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:07,409
describe what we want to draw. First, we need to loop through each layer and

3
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:11,078
then for each layer loop through the tile IDs contained in the data of each

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,876
layer. Now, if you recall a significant portion of these IDs will be set to

5
00:00:14,888 --> 00:00:18,624
zero. That indicates not to draw any tile at that specific location. If the

6
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:22,210
given ID is not zero, then we go ahead and grab the packet information by

7
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:25,775
calling the getTilePacket function, passing in the tile ID that we have.
