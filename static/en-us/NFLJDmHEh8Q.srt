00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,440
Alright. This is pretty cool, Sam. We've got all these charts, and let me put

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,280
them in our dashboard. And then what else could we do for a music festival?

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,360
>> Well, I mean, there are so many different chart types, right?

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:09,450
>> Yeah.

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,940
>> Like we haven't used pie chart yet.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,030
>> Yeah.

7
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,560
>> You could probably have a distribution

8
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,970
of all the different types of music.

9
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:14,115
>> Mm-hm.

10
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:15,480
>> That were playing at the festival.

11
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:15,710
>> Mm-hm.

12
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,150
>> Maybe a percentage of how may are Bossa nova?

13
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,551
>> Right.

14
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:19,100
[LAUGH]

15
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,100
>>

16
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,650
[LAUGH]

17
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,427
>> I don't even know who Bossa nova is.

18
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:21,734
>> I know.

19
00:00:21,734 --> 00:00:24,050
>> Well maybe we like I would like

20
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,660
to know, for the different stages, who's racking up

21
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,540
the most maintenance tickets, cause you know maybe

22
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,140
they need to get their act together or something.

23
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,150
>> Yeah, and I mean that's another pie chart we could make. Is distribution

24
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,390
of priority of tickets. Like how many are marked as high priority versus low?

25
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,760
>> Right, well let's let's make one.

26
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:40,860
>> Okay.
