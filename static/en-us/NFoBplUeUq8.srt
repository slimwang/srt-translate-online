1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So now we know that when we compare the result of the forward Euler method,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
it's going to deviate from the exact solution.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now assume that you have two numerical solutions.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
One solution with the forward Euler method of step size h1 and another with a step size of h2

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
larger than h1, and assume that these two and the exact solution almost line up.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The question then is--can we estimate the error between this numerical solution

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and the exact solution that we do not know based on the difference

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
between those two numerical solutions, which we know.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So given the distance between two solutions using the forward Euler method,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
how would you estimate the error between the exact solution

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and this first solution with the step size h1?

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Should it be E times the ratio, E times the ratio of the difference to the first step size,

13
00:01:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
E times the ratio of the first step size to the difference, or E times the inverse ratio?
