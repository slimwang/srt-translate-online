1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,380
Now that we know how caches find
data when we are looking for it.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,140
Let's talk about what happens when we
need to replace something from the cache

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,340
to make room for new data,
because we have a miss.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,600
So the situation,
when we need replacement,

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,440
is the set where the data
needs to go is full.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,230
We have a miss, so

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,220
we need somewhere to put the new
block that we are bringing in.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,240
And we need to put it in that set.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,770
And the question for cache replacement

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:33,270
is which of the blocks in the set do we
kick out to make room for the new one?

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,240
Possible replacement policies are,
random.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,020
Just pick a block randomly from
those that are in the set.

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,950
FIFO, which kicks out the block
that has been there the longest.

14
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,000
So in FIFO,
let's say we have two blocks.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,210
We bring in A, then we bring B.

16
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,880
When we want to bring in C,

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,100
we're going to kick out A because
it's been there the longest.

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,050
Then we're going to kick out
B to bring D, and so on.

19
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,390
The next policy is LRU or
Least Recently Used.

20
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,990
We want to kick out the block that
has not been used the longest.

21
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,130
So we definitely don't want to kick
out the block that is the most

22
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,600
recently used.

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,700
And then the next most recently,
and so on.

24
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,910
So pretty much we track which
block has been used more recently.

25
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,500
And when we need to replace something,

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,630
we choose the block that we
haven't used for the longest time.

27
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,630
It turns out that LRU is
a really good policy.

28
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,610
So, there are several policies that are
trying to approximate it because this is

29
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,060
not easy to do.

30
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,940
One such policy, for example,
is NMRU or Not Most Recently Used,

31
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,990
which tracks just which block has
been used the most recently, and

32
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,140
then picks randomly among
the remaining blocks.

33
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,720
So pretty much,
don't pick the block that was just used.
