1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,374
Now one last technique that we will discuss that can be helpful in reducing

2
00:00:04,374 --> 00:00:08,466
stress and in turn have positive effects on physical and psychological health

3
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:14,844
is meditation. Meditation involves the practice of sitting quietly and clearing

4
00:00:14,844 --> 00:00:19,900
one's mind by concentrating on the present moment. Now this may sound easy to

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,317
do but it's actually quite difficult. Mindfulness is one technique for focusing

6
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:30,286
on present. That is, being in the moment. So, mindfulness meditation is the act

7
00:00:30,286 --> 00:00:35,077
of meditating while being aware of the present moment. And in the present

8
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:39,301
moment, concentrating only on breathing or in some cases, you may concentrate

9
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:44,660
on a particular saying or thought. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to

10
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,684
have a positive effect on both physiological and psychological well being. For

11
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:54,836
example, reducing pain, depression and anxiety. Therefore, mindfulness

12
00:00:54,836 --> 00:00:58,928
meditation is an important technique or tool that can be used to combat the

13
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:04,134
negative reactions to stress. I encourage you to go to YouTube and look up some

14
00:01:04,134 --> 00:01:08,985
mindfulness meditation practices and then try them. And incorporate these into

15
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:12,569
your daily activities so you can have a powerful tool for combating negative

16
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:16,460
psychological and physiological effects of stress.
