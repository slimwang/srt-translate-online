00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,053
So, recall that we just said that people respond differently to stress. And one

2
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:07,551
of the things that determines this difference in how people respond to stress,

3
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:13,477
is how positively or negatively they see the world. So, certainly you've all

4
00:00:13,477 --> 00:00:18,208
heard the term optimist and pessimist. Now, the optimist, as the saying goes,

5
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:24,040
will see this glass as half full and the pessimist will see it as half empty.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,280
So, optimism is good, not just for our behavior, but for our minds and our

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,570
bodies as well. So, for instance, research has shown that optimists are less

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,750
likely to get depressed. They're better able to cope with their emotions, and

9
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:44,310
they recover faster from, and cope better with stress. So, optimism is good for

10
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,790
our minds and our bodies.
