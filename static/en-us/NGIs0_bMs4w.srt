If you said 2/20, great work. We know 2 times 1
is 2 and 5 times 4 is 20. You might have also

2
00:00:04,967 --> 00:00:09,551
put a different answer. You might have
reduced. You might have divided your

3
00:00:09,563 --> 00:00:14,641
fraction by 2/2, and you would have gotten
1/10. Both 1/10 and 2/20 are correct.

4
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:19,253
Let's look at why. So here, I have two
candy bars. This top one's been put up on

5
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:24,318
20th. This bottom one has been split up
into 10th. I know that my answer was

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,067
supposed to be 2/20. Two out of 20 pieces.
Visually, I can see that's 1/10. I have

7
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:33,574
one out of the ten pieces down here. 2/20
and 1/10 are actually equal fractions.

8
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:37,586
They represent the same amount.
Oftentimes, you say that 1/10 is the

9
00:00:37,598 --> 00:00:41,698
reduced form or the simplified form of
2/20. But as we can tell, both are

10
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,763
actually equal. They just look different.
