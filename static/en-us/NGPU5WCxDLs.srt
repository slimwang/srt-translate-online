1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So now we have reached our first real world differential equation --

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the second derivative of the position vector of the spacecraft,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
which is its acceleration vector,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
equals the gravitational constant times the mass of the earth

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
times a vector that points from the spacecraft to the earth

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
divided by the 3rd power of its length.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This boils down to the 3rd power of the distance between the spacecraft and earth.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now comes the component due to the moon--

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
gravitational constant times the mass of the moon

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
times vector from the spacecraft to the moon

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
divided by the 3rd power of its length.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is a differential equation -- an equation that governs or is governed by rates of change.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The acceleration vector is the rate of change of a rate of change.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This actually is a system of differential equations.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's not a single equation.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We've got two components in here.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Each of these two components has to fulfill this equation.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The highest derivative that occurs is the second one,

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
which is why we call this differential equation a differential equation of order 2.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The highest derivative stands alone on one side and does not occur anywhere else.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is what we call explicit.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If the highest derivative was hidden somewhere,

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
we would first need to solve that equation, which is ugly.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
These two terms mean that this differential equation is nonlinear.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
A linear differential equation would only contain terms such as 42 times xs

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
or sin(t) times xs.
