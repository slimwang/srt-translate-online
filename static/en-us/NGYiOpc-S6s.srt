Since you had so much practice with composite functions, in that last lesson. I

2
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:08,237
wonder what would happen if we made a composite function by using a function

3
00:00:08,237 --> 00:00:12,750
and its inverse? These functions have been working pretty well for us so far,

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,770
so let's just keep going with them. Using these two function then, what is f of

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,889
f inverse of x? And what is f inverse of f of x?
