1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well, we're going to follow the same recursive procedure to get every answer,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
check and see if we have it, and if not, call our parents.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So, a--I don't know what it is. How about you?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I don't know what it is. Oh, it's 99.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
B--I don't know what it is. Do you? Oh, it's 88.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
C--I don't know. Don't know. Don't know.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Looks like it's 3.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
D--looks like it's 77.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And this last one requires you to remember a bit about the corner case

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
in our environment lookup.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't know what it is. Do you? No, do you?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
No, do you? No, do you?

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And my parent pointer is none, so we'll just return none.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We don't have a value for this variable.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We could also have raised some sort of exception.
