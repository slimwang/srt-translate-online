1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now I'd like to ask you if you can find a more general pattern for the correction factor

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
for the variance calculation on a sample.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is a challenging question.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The one example you did before may not have been enough for you to figure this out,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
so feel free to do more examples with different size samples

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
to see if you can figure this out.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Choose one of the following as the correction factor.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Is it n, n + 1 over n, n over n + 1, n divided by n - 1, n - 1 divided by n,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
or is it n squared - 1 over n - 1?

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Recall that n is equal to the number of data points in the sample.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Select the right answer.
