00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,520
Entropy has a mathematical formula.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,180
Let me give it to you now.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:09,260
The formula is negative Pi log2(Pi).

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,470
Let's unpack this.

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:16,490
Pi is the fraction of examples that are in a given class, class i.

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,480
And then, you sum over all the classes that are available.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,400
In the next few videos,

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,790
I'll give you lots of hands on experience with performing entropy calculations.

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,880
But first, let me give you just a little bit of intuition.

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,870
As you can see from this definition,

11
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,510
entropy is basically the opposite of the purity.

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,610
So, in one extreme you can have all the examples be of the same class.

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,120
In that case, the entropy will be 0.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,140
In the other extreme,

15
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,480
you can have the examples be evenly split between all the available classes.

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,080
In that case,

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,154
entropy will take on it's mathematically maximal value which is 1.0.
