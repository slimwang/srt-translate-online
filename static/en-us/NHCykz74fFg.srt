00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now for both physical and mobile channels, there's an art to building a minimum viable product.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Just think about this, an MVP is not a minimal product.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
An MVP is not like, well, we only have three weeks so we cut off the featured list here.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's not what an MVP is--an MVP is based on interaction and iteration

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
in understanding customer's needs and pains and gains.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And if all you're doing is cutting off the featured list, then you clearly haven't run the process.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Sometimes we get, but my customers really don't know what they want.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm creating something so new and getting out of the building is just a waste of time because if I

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
show them my solution, they're not even going to know what problem I'm talking about.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We're going to be talking about the problem of market type in a subsequent lecture

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but there's a case called the new market where you're right,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
customers have never seen an iPhone before or never seen a new product before.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In that case, you still want to get out of the building, but instead of asking them about features,

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
you actually want to understand how are they spending their time now

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and what solutions are they using to solve their pains and gains.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And so we'll talk about market type later but when you hear people say,

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but my customers don't know what they want, just park that for a while,

18
00:01:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
because that's not an excuse to stay in the building and keep adding features.
