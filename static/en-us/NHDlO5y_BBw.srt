1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,280
So here I am, back at the code again and if

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,670
I scroll down, you will notice that I made one change to

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,520
the code, which is, that I added an if statement to print

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,020
out more easily readable output messages. Let me run the code now.

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,930
Aha. The program says that there is a profane

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,780
in the movie_quotes document. And if I go back

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,560
to my movie_quotes document, I can find the culprit

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,700
word. So, let me go ahead and quickly change that.

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:37,180
So, I will change that back and save this document and now, if I run my code, I

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,230
get a message saying no curse words were found.

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,970
Alright, the second step in our program is also done.
