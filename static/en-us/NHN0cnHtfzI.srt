Great job.

2
00:00:01,245 --> 00:00:04,710
You've built the task content provider
and a complete to do list app

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,219
that lets you add and delete task data
and display it all on the main screen.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,100
I encourage you to continue
playing around with this code.

5
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,299
Customize the UI.

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,390
Or add different sorting, or editing,
or sharing capabilities as you like.

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,160
And now that you know how to
build your own content provider,

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,100
it should be easier to set one up for
Sunshine to manage weather data.
