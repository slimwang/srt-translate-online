1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,930
Now that you've reviewed the code for
the last couple of apps,

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,450
how would you update this app
to provide continual updates?

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,780
Now depending on requirements,

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,720
it sometimes makes sense to
have a continuous update.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,170
For example, if you're writing
a dog walker or recycling app, or

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,430
something else that's going to
plot your position over time,

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,620
you'll want continuous updates.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,090
Now, I've given you a little hint.

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,220
Your MainActivity extends to
ConnectionCallbacks here and

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,600
an OnConnectionFailedListener here.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,720
But to receive continuous updates it
also needs to be a location listener.

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,380
How would you do that?
