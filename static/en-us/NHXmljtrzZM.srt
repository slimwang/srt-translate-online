1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So now we talk about one of my favorite topics hypothesis testing.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And the reason why I love this topic is because it's really about decision making.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We talked a lot about data or often called the sample and we used statistics to extract information

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and now we use more statistics to make decisions and the decisions to be binary, be it a yes or no.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And the reason why I like this, I think life is all about decision making.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I think there is no meaning in doing statistics without eventually at least making a decision.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is the first time in this class, you're going to make an actual decision.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So in this box of pills for weight loss and particularly it says that 90% probability,

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
taking these pills, a substantial weight loss is being guaranteed.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now suppose your job is not to make a decision whether to buy this box or not.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I can promise you in all likelihood why those pills don't work but whether this claim is correct or not

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
so you really care about why the company that sells this product made a correct thing.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And to do so, you talk to people who have taken this medicine

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and you ask question--did you lose weight?

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes or no and say this is a magical medication.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And 11 out of 15 people tell you yes, but 4 out 15 people tell you no.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Obviously, this is not 90%. In fact, what do you think it is in percent?
