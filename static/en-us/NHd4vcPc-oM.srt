To conclude, patterns are an essential part of developers' vocabularies.

2
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:07,850
We simply must be aware of what's there in order to take advantage of it.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,320
However, patterns are difficult to learn passively.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,050
You can read all the catalogs you want. But

00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,730
unless you actually get some experience with catalogs, they're not going to be,

come to mind readily when you're in a development situation. However,

00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,420
despite these costs and potential problems that might arise from using patterns,

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,340
they are so powerful that you want to take advantage of them when you can.
