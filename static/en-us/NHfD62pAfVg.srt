1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,040
Now that we have Unity installed and

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,350
opened, we first have
to create a project.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,250
Let's name it Hello World.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,170
Next, choose location.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,350
I'm going to be using
the default Desktop.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,980
Also, make sure you're
project is set to 3D.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,666
With that set, go ahead and
click Create project.

8
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:24,130
After a few seconds,
the editor will open up.

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,590
Now you might be thinking,
what in the world am I looking at?

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,320
So let's break that down.

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,520
Smack in the middle here,
we have the Scene view.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,340
Which is where you'll be able to
view the world you're creating.

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,220
By default,

14
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,370
Unity creates a really simple scene that
allows us to see the sky and the ground.

15
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:47,010
While holding down the right mouse
button, you can press W to move forward.

16
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,310
A to move left.

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,820
D to move right.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,200
And S to move backwards in your scene.

19
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,900
To the left of the scene view,
we have the hierarchy.

20
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,361
This is a place where we can see a list
of all of the game objects we've added

21
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:08,189
to our scene.

22
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,784
A game object is Unity's way of
representing anything that can

23
00:01:12,784 --> 00:01:14,190
affect our scene.

24
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,510
This could be a light, a cube,
or a complex character.

25
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,959
Currently, we have a main camera and
a directional light.

26
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,942
Each game object can
have many components and

27
00:01:25,942 --> 00:01:31,160
we can see those in the Inspector,
which is the window on the right.

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,718
To view components in the Inspector,
we need to click on a game object.

29
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:37,400
Lets click on the Main Camera.

30
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:43,574
We now see a list of all of the
components, specifically, the Transform,

31
00:01:43,574 --> 00:01:48,579
the Camera, GUI Layer,
Flair Layer, and Audio Listener.

32
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:51,249
Each component has a list
of properties that we

33
00:01:51,249 --> 00:01:54,760
can use to customize the way
a component behaves.

34
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,140
Let's examine this by taking
a look at the Transform component.

35
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,208
The Transform component has
three properties, Position,

36
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:05,540
Rotation, and Scale.

37
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,310
Every game object has a transform.

38
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,695
And for each game object, there's also a
tool in the top left where we can change

39
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:14,339
these properties visually.

40
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:18,644
For example,
we can select the Rotation tool and

41
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:22,510
drag the camera in the Scene view.

42
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,520
This changes where the camera is facing.

43
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,040
You can pause the video here and
play around with this tools.

44
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,970
When playing around with
the rotation of our camera,

45
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:37,690
we can actually see our changes in the
Camera Preview, and also the Game view.

46
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,740
The Game view is located in a tab
next to the Scene view, and

47
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,470
is the view that users will be able to
see when you finally publish your app.

48
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,140
So, it's pretty important to keep an eye
out on what they'll actually see.

49
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,280
In fact, because it's so
important to see the Game view, I prefer

50
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,030
to actually view it all times, which is
why I drag it next to the Scene view.

51
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,800
The Unity interface
is very customizable.

52
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,650
So feel free to pause the video
here to drag anything

53
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,047
around to match the work
style you desire.

54
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:11,105
Unity even provides a few templates
of common interfaces to use,

55
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:15,080
if you go to the Layout drop-down and
choose one.

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,640
For the purposes of clarity,

57
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,155
we'll be sticking with the Default
layout in this nanodegree.

58
00:03:20,155 --> 00:03:21,650
But practically,

59
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,180
anyone in the industry can use
the interface to suit their needs.

60
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,960
The last window I want to discuss
is the Projects at the bottom.

61
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,730
This is a place where we can access any
file we save or import into our project.

62
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,590
This includes code we write, 3D models
we build, or just full out scenes.

63
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,080
Let's actually go ahead and save our
scene now by going to File &gt; Save Scene.

64
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,030
Just like a Word doc we can save our
scene anywhere in our file system.

65
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:57,390
For now, I'm going to save it as
OurFirstScene in the Assets folder.

66
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,780
And now we can see our scene
file in the Assets folder.

67
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,230
And that pretty much covers
all the windows we see,

68
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,340
right when we start up Unity.

69
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,660
It's time to start practicing
navigating around.

70
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,450
But overall, not too bad right?
