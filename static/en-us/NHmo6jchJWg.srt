If we want to define the set Fruit like we did before,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
we can write the following, and when I print Fruit I get the following.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Notice that I could have included apple twice,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and when I print I get the exact same thing because sets don't take duplicates into account.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I can also print the set Vegetable and notice that the order that I defined this set in

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
is not necessarily the order that it gets printed in. Sets don't care about order.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Once we've defined these sets, we can check for membership.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For example, maybe I want to know if apple is in the set Fruit,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and when I run this statement I get a true.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Apple is in Fruit.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Sense apple is not in Vegetable, this statement gives me False.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
For a quiz, what's going to be the output when I print this statement:

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
fruit--with a vertical bar--vegetable? Select the best option.
