Let's first play around with this really cool applet. Click the link below to

2
00:00:04,507 --> 00:00:09,398
open it, you need to have Java installed on your computer to view it. Now, what

3
00:00:09,398 --> 00:00:15,110
happens if you roll one die at least 100 times. To get a feel for it, you can

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:20,806
try rolling one die, one time. Try rolling it again, and then, you'll see the

5
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:26,332
distribution start to build up. Then, you can change this part here, so that

6
00:00:26,332 --> 00:00:31,900
you're rolling one die, 100 times and it'll plot all of the values that the die

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,651
lands on, or the simulated die. So, what happens you roll it at least 100 times?

8
00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:40,143
What does the distribution look like?
