00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Male] The next group of questions test how well you understand

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
strings in Python.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The question is given any string s, so the variable s

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
holds the value of any string,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
which of the following always have the same exact value as s?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And as a reminder, you should be careful

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
to remember that s could be the empty string.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Here are the choices.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Check the box corresponding to each expression

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
that always has the same value as s

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
no matter what string s refers to.
