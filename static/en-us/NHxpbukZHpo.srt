1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,740
Given this idea that any signal, certainly any periodic signal,

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,520
can be made up of a sum of sinusoids, we're going to start to move to,

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,090
from just this notion of a series, to notion of a continuous signal.

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,430
And we're going to talk about a, something that will allow us to know how

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,990
much power of any given frequency there is in an image.

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,630
That is, we want to transform our image from, just something that's or, or

7
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,770
our signal that's something a function of time, or

8
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,340
just of space, to know what it is in terms of its frequency.

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,990
And that transform is called what?

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,940
It's called the Fourier transform.

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,710
And now we're going to, so

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,600
we did Fourier series, then we go to Fourier transform, and then we'll go to

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,680
discrete Fourier transform, which will get us to that image stuff, alright?

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,960
So we want to understand the frequency, and

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,720
frequency is usually written as omega, of our signal.

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,030
So, we want to parametrize, we want to transform our signal,

17
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,880
instead of by x, which is in space, by omega.

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,070
And we do that by what's known as the Fourier Transform.

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,580
And the Fourier Transform is going to take some spacial signal out and

20
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,530
it's going to give us some properties that encode both

21
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,870
the phase and the magnitude for each given omega.

22
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,650
Okay, so we need the phase and the magnitude for each given omega.

23
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,390
Specifically for every omega from zero to infinity,

24
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,560
and actually its from minus infinity to infinity.

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,020
The idea is that f of omega holds the amplitude and

26
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,320
the phase alright of the corresponding sinusoid.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,010
So this f has to have the amplitude and phase.

28
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,530
How can f single thing, hold both amplitude and phase?

29
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,370
Notice I didn't say a single number.

30
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:44,860
Cause remember, f of x is just the value of F, right, so it's a number.

31
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,760
F of omega is going to be amplitude and phase, how do we that?

32
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,090
Well, f is actually, the capital F, is actually a complex number.

33
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,450
Now hopefully, you remember something about your complex numbers.

34
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,330
If not, I'm going to [LAUGH] give you a really, really brief review, okay?

35
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,360
So basically, F of omega is made up of two parts.

36
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,600
A real part and then what's referred to as an imaginary part, okay?

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,410
So remember, A plus BI.

38
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,290
Okay well in this case its the real part of omega plus the imaginary part.

39
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,280
And you may remember that the magnitude of a complex number

40
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,540
is just the square root of the sum of the two elements.

41
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,350
Normally the square root of A squared plus B squared so

42
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,360
here its the square root of the R squared plus the I squared.

43
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,280
And re R is for real and I is for imaginary and

44
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,850
the phase the relationship between these is going to be written this way okay.

45
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,480
Its the arch tangent of the imaginary plus the real.

46
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,720
And the thing that's missing here is the idea that the real part is going to

47
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,530
be due to the even function and the odd part is going to be and

48
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,740
the, and the imaginary part is due to the odd.

49
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,430
And all that means if I have a function here this is

50
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,940
my cosign function, alright.

51
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,020
And that's even with respect to the origin that is

52
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,230
symmetric about respect to the origin.

53
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,010
The sinusoid and I'm going to screw this up right because it has to come here.

54
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,850
And then be there, and then, so it has to be zero, there we are,

55
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,480
that's my sinusoid.

56
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,630
because it, it has to come down to zero when that thing is high, all right.

57
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,780
It is odd, that is sine of, of negative x is minus sine of x,

58
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,700
whereas cosine of negative x is equal to the cosine of x.

59
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,270
So the bottom line is, is that this part is,

60
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,490
the real part is going to be the cosine part.

61
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,070
And the odd, and the imaginary part will be the sine part.
