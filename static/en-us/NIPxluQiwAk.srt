The first time you log into Salesforce, there's a lot on the page, and it can be

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,850
a little bit overwhelming. That's a good thing. That's

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,690
because there's so many things that you can do.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,370
Feel free to explore and click around. As

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,080
you build apps, you'll often come back to the

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,300
setup area, so you can find the setup link

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,090
at the top of the page and reorient yourself.
