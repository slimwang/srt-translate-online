1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,705
Now, I do want to be clear.

2
00:00:01,705 --> 00:00:06,650
There is no single one right answer,
as long as you're separating concerns.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,064
So rather then compare my code to yours,

4
00:00:09,064 --> 00:00:13,408
instead look at how my code is organized
and draw inspiration from that.

5
00:00:13,408 --> 00:00:16,507
Now to show out,
I'll show you my index.html file.

6
00:00:16,507 --> 00:00:17,808
This is very simple.

7
00:00:17,808 --> 00:00:22,067
I have a ul called cat list and
a div with an id of cat.

8
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:25,829
It has a cat-name, cat-count and
cat-image inside of it.

9
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:29,263
These things are things that
the view is going to hook on to and

10
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,588
update whenever it's told to render.

11
00:00:31,588 --> 00:00:33,481
Let's dive into the JavaScript now.

12
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:38,182
First, we'll take a look at the model.

13
00:00:38,182 --> 00:00:41,930
Now, in this case,
the model is simply and object literal

14
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,843
with currentCat set to null and cats
being this very large array of objects.

15
00:00:46,843 --> 00:00:50,813
Each one of these objects represents
a cat and inside of each of these cats,

16
00:00:50,813 --> 00:00:54,483
I've got clickCount, name,
image source and image attribution.

17
00:00:54,483 --> 00:00:56,989
Now lets scroll down and
look at our octopus.

18
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:01,900
In our octopus, I have the init method,
which starts off the entire application.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,522
I also have a getCurrentCat and
getCat function.

20
00:01:05,522 --> 00:01:09,983
The view calls both of those in order to
get the current cat or all of the cats,

21
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:12,163
so that way you can render properly.

22
00:01:12,163 --> 00:01:14,543
We also have a setCurrentCat function.

23
00:01:14,543 --> 00:01:16,067
You passed it in object and

24
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:19,546
it sets the CurrentCat equal to
the object that you pass in.

25
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,066
And lastly, we have incrementCounter.

26
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:26,501
What that does is it takes our current
cat and it increments it's ClickCount.

27
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:29,867
Now whenever that happens,
it tells the catView to render.

28
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:32,597
Let's take a quick look at our
view before we see the flow of

29
00:01:32,597 --> 00:01:33,501
the application.

30
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:35,161
First, we have the catView.

31
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:39,039
The catView is object with an init
function and a render function.

32
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:43,220
I've separated these out, so that I
can render it whenever I want to, but

33
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,844
init only gets called once.

34
00:01:44,844 --> 00:01:49,312
For example, I don't want to grab all of
these DOM elements from the DOM every

35
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,707
single time we render.

36
00:01:50,707 --> 00:01:54,584
I may as well just do it once and
store them here on the catView.

37
00:01:54,584 --> 00:01:59,739
Similarly, I only want to add the click
listener for the catView once.

38
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:05,319
Now the reason is because as I click
between cats over here in index.html,

39
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,341
it just changes this information here.

40
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:10,616
It does not replace the entire div.

41
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:14,586
This div is always here and
this image element is always here.

42
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:17,165
So, I can add the event
listener one time.

43
00:02:17,165 --> 00:02:21,495
And then no matter cat I change to,
these elements will always be the same,

44
00:02:21,495 --> 00:02:25,164
they'll just have differing content and
a source attribute.

45
00:02:25,164 --> 00:02:29,338
And lastly in our catView init method,
we call this.render,

46
00:02:29,338 --> 00:02:31,236
which will update the view.

47
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:32,583
What does render do?

48
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,722
All it does is it gets our
current cat from the octopus,

49
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,119
which of course, gets it from the model.

50
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:41,279
And then we set the count element and
the name and

51
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:46,582
the image to the clickCount and the name
and the image source of our CurrentCat.

52
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:50,113
Remember that these on the left
hand are the DOM elements, so

53
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:51,713
that's our catListView.

54
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,999
Render gets called over and
over and over again, but

55
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:56,799
init only gets called once.

56
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:59,237
We'll see where that gets
called in just a moment.

57
00:02:59,237 --> 00:03:01,199
Let's take a look at our catListView.

58
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,335
Our catListView is
actually a bit simpler.

59
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:06,097
Here we have our init method,
which only gets called once.

60
00:03:06,097 --> 00:03:10,794
We grab the catListElement from the DOM
and put it in this variable here and

61
00:03:10,794 --> 00:03:12,936
then we say, render ourselves.

62
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:14,362
Let's see what render does.

63
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:18,827
We first get the cats from the octopus,
which of course originally would get

64
00:03:18,827 --> 00:03:22,758
it from the model, then we empty our ul,
which lists all the cats.

65
00:03:22,758 --> 00:03:26,962
And then we go over all of the cat
objects and we create an li and

66
00:03:26,962 --> 00:03:29,281
we do all of the necessary stuff.

67
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:33,484
That being setting the text content
equal to the name of the cat and

68
00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:35,098
adding EventListener.

69
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:38,584
Now here's my little closure trick
that I had to do in order to make this

70
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:40,062
EventListener inside the for

71
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:43,921
loop work and you'll find that this is
a common thing that you'll have to do.

72
00:03:43,921 --> 00:03:47,214
If you're adding EventListeners
inside of a for loop,

73
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:51,136
you actually need to create a larger
function, pass in your cat and

74
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:55,636
then return the function, which does
the stuff that you want with that cat.

75
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:59,324
So ultimately, all of this code says,
when you click on the element,

76
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:02,886
tell the octopus to set the CurrentCat
and then render the catView,

77
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:04,215
because it's changed.

78
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:08,733
And lastly, add all of our lis
inside of this for loop that we've

79
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:13,096
created to our CatListElement,
the unordered list of cats.

80
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:15,093
Now, let's run through this really fast.

81
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:18,099
Octopus.init, this makes
everything happen.

82
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:20,793
When this gets called,
the following things happen.

83
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:27,340
We say, hey, model, set your CurrentCat
property equal to model.Cats 0.

84
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,975
In other words,
the first cat in the list.

85
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:35,536
And then we say,
catListView.init and catView.init.

86
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:38,218
We tell our views to
initialize themselves.

87
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:41,380
And then the views handle all
the stuff they need to do without

88
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,373
the octopus needing to get involved.

89
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:45,202
Now if you liked to go over this code,

90
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,634
you can find a link to it
in the Instructor Notes.

91
00:04:47,634 --> 00:04:51,726
I would definitely suggest you dive in
and see if you can figure out exactly

92
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:55,029
how every part of this works,
then compare it to your code.

93
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:58,918
If you want to go back to your code and
make any changes, go ahead and

94
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:01,194
do that now, but don't copy my code.

95
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:04,549
Remember, this is not my project,
this is your project.

96
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:08,450
So, only use my code as
organizational inspiration.

97
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,448
Once you're satisfied with your version
of Cat Clicker Premium, go ahead and

98
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:13,610
click to continue on.
