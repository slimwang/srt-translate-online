00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,680
Let us look at the details of constraint propagation. To do so,

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,650
we'll take a specific example from computer vision. Here's an example of a 2D

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:14,720
image composed of a large number of pixels. The greyness at any one pixel

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,800
is a depiction of the intensity of light at that pixel. Now of course, you and

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,030
can immediately recognize that this is a cube. But how do we do it, and

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,775
how can we make a machine do it? [UNKNOWN] decompose a task of 3D object

7
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:33,750
recognition into several several sub-tasks. Miles said in the first sub-task,

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,770
a visual system detects edges, or lines as shown here. At this particular point,

9
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,810
no surfaces have been detected. In this particular point, no 3D object has been

10
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:49,770
fignized. Just these pixels have been put into lines based on the intensities

11
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,741
of light in different pixels. According to Miles the second sub task of object

12
00:00:54,741 --> 00:01:00,409
recognition consists of grouping these lines and the surfaces with orientations,

13
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:05,690
as indicated here. So now these four lines have been grouped into the surface,

14
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,970
and then orientation defined by the perpendicular the surface, and

15
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,300
similarly these four lines, and these four lines. In the third and

16
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,730
final phase of the object recognition task, according to Miles surfaces

17
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,840
are grouped into a complete 3D object. At this particular point,

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,940
your visual system recognizes that this is a cube. Miles theory has been

19
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,790
very influential in computer vision. It has actually also been influential in AI

20
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,500
as a whole. One of the lessons we can take away from Miles' theory of computer

21
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,810
vision of object's recognition is that before we get into our guarded tones for

22
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,720
addressing the task, we want to understand how a task gets decomposed into sub

23
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,620
tasks. Throughout this course, we have emphasized task decomposition repeatedly.

24
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,630
As an example, when we were talking about understanding,

25
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:01,070
a big task of understanding got decomposed into a series of small tasks.

26
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:06,520
Where surface level cues acted as probes into memory and

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,410
a frame was retrieved. The slice of the frames dented expectations.

28
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,500
Lexicon and grammatical analysts led to the identification of objects and

29
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,530
predicates that would satisfy those expectations. And the fillers were put in.

30
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,400
Problem reduction certainly is a general purpose method for decomposing complex

31
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,970
tasks into smaller tasks. This notion of class decomposition is a powerful

32
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:37,660
idea irrespective of what algorithm we use for any of these specific sub tasks
