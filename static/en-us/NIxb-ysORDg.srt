00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,336
If you're acing these problems, then great work. I don't think they're the

2
00:00:04,336 --> 00:00:07,188
easiest, so let's try one more problem broken down into parts just like the

3
00:00:07,188 --> 00:00:14,040
first one. For this quadratic inequality, I want you to tell me the 0s first.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,773
Find the values of m that would make this left side equal to zero. Write the

5
00:00:18,773 --> 00:00:23,393
lesser value for m here, and the greater value for m here.
