00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,655
The add and remove methods, let's you add elements or remove them at arbitrary

2
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:09,456
index positions. So if we add a bunch of pictures and now we add one at

3
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:13,482
position 0, the new one gets added here and what used to be position 0 is now

4
00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:20,495
position one. What used to be position one is now position two and so on. Now

5
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:26,763
let's look at remove, here we remove the element at position two. And the other

6
00:00:26,763 --> 00:00:30,345
offsets of course, are now different. Note that you've seen a different version

7
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:33,944
of the add method when we first learned about array lists. That method did not

8
00:00:33,944 --> 00:00:37,400
have a position, when you omit the position, then add simply adds it at the end

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,190
of the array list. In the next exercise I'd like you to put add and remove to

10
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,932
work. Here's what I want you to do. When you have an array list of pictures, I

11
00:00:46,932 --> 00:00:51,458
want you to slide the last one to the front so that all the others get shifted

12
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:55,719
to the right. Go ahead and give it a try.
