1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,250
So this is Sensitive Data Quiz.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,019
Again, select the best answer.

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:11,690
Assume that label L1 of a document D1
dominates label L2 of document D2.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,252
There are two documents, D1 and D2.

5
00:00:14,252 --> 00:00:17,230
The label are L1 and L2, and

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,170
these labels are defined
the way we've been discussing.

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,520
So these are, let's say,
DOD kind of documents.

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,950
So sensitivity level could
be top secret or secret and

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,570
compartment is what kind of information
is contained in this document.

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,450
The question here is
that L1 dominates L2.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,100
It dominates L2, so
we know L1 is greater than L2.

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,900
This is sort of what is
the interpretation on that domination.

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,920
I guess that three options sort of
present three different interpretations

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,460
and you have to say based on what we
understand about label domination

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,120
which one is the correct interpretation.
