00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Another category of graphs that are very important and come up a lot are planar graphs.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
These are graphs that can be drawn in the plane on a flat piece of paper

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
so that the edges don't cross.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here's an example of a planar graph.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We've got five nodes and five edges.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You see the way I drew it here. This node here and this node needed to be connected.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I just drew a nice, little curvy line without crossing anything else.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is a planar graph. It still would be a planar graph even if I drew it with a crossing in it,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
because the issue is that there is some way to do it so that the edges don't cross.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now, in this particular example, we've got five nodes and five edges,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
but what we're interested in is what is the relationship in general between the number

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
of nodes in a planar graph and the number of edges.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This is more complicated example than any of the ones we looked at before in this unit.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There is some kind of a relationship, and there are constraints

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
by virtue of the fact that the graph is drawn in the plane.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's take a look at that. Let's think about adding some edges here.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We can add that edge. We can add this edge. We can add this edge.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We can add this edge, and are there any more edges we can add

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
while still being able to draw it in a plane? It doesn't look that way, right?

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This node is connected to all the other nodes. This one is done.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This node is connected to three other nodes, but it can't reach this one.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It seems like it's sort of all blocked out. That's going to be true in general.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There's going to be some graphs that can't be drawn as a planar graph.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If we add this edge between this node and this node, the resulting graph is no longer planar.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
How many edges do we get here all told?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In this example, the number of edges seems to need to be less than or equal to 9.
