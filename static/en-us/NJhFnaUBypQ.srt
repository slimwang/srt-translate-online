00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,790
Okay Michael so
to demonstrate this idea or

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,870
to demonstrate some of these ideas
I'm going to look at grid worlds.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,280
One a very simple grid world
to try to get across a pretty

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,370
straightforward idea, at least what I
hope's a pretty straightforward idea.

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,160
And then a slightly more complicated and
prettier grid world in about a moment.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,550
But first let's look at
kind of a basic grid world.

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,540
So this is like our famous four
by three grid world except I

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,070
added a couple of details.

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,600
I haven't drawn all the little
squares and all the little tiny grids.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,430
Because really, I just sort of
want to pop up a level here.

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,660
But you start somewhere in this world,
it almost doesn't matter where,

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,920
and you have to try to get here.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,920
To the little plus one that's where
all the reward in the world is.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,420
And you have the normal actions.

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,760
You can move up, down, left, right.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,940
And you know it's slippery.

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,620
So every once in a while when you
try to move up you end up moving in

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,700
a perpendicular direction.

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,510
And the usual sort of
thing that we normally do.

20
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,420
Now other than that, what's different
about this world is that I've got walls,

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,900
like we had before.

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:04,099
Except these walls actually happened
to coincidentally create little rooms.

23
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,610
So let's imagine that you're
starting over here somewhere and

24
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:13,800
your goal is to eventually learn in
this world how to get to, well let's go.

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,330
So I think we know how to do this.

26
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,080
I think we've done this before many many
times we certainly did it in the four by

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,580
three grid world but I'm going to ask
you a slightly different question.

28
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,990
I want you to think about this
in a slightly different way.

29
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:32,230
If you were trying to tell a person how

30
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,430
you should get from this point to
this point what would you tell them?

31
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,790
>> I'm going to say Google Maps.

32
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,710
>> This is not Google Maps.

33
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,400
This is in a GPS dead zone.

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,850
>> What?
>> I know, I know it's amazing.

35
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,630
>> Wow I guess that's one of the real
benefits of reinforcement learning

36
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,690
is it can work even
even a GPS dead zone.

37
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,580
So the question is how is this?

38
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,670
How would you tell them to go?

39
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:57,010
Well, so, you know,
we talk to agents via policies.

40
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,790
So I could try to give a policy.

41
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,720
But you didn't really get.

42
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,280
So that's a mapping
from states to actions.

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,090
But you don't really give me a lot of
details about what the states where.

44
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,280
So probably if I was talking to a person
I would say something kind of high level

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,150
like well pass through
the doorway to the east.

46
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,010
Then you enter a room and
there's a doorway to the south.

47
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,060
Go through that and

48
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,099
then a little bit inside the doorway
you'll find a great reward.

49
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,380
Or at least a reward.

50
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,730
>> Plus one is the greatest reward
that anyone can receive Michael.

51
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,585
You know that.

52
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:32,430
>> [LAUGH]
>> So right and

53
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,790
I like this because what you did is I
gave you the actions up down left right.

54
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,310
And you could have said okay so
move right, right, right,

55
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,300
right, right down right, right and then
go I don't know right, right down, down,

56
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,660
down, down, down, down, down, down,
down, down write or something but

57
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,490
instead you said well go to the doorway
and then go to another doorway and

58
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,370
then once you're past the doorway, you
know you'll just take a couple steps and

59
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,940
you'll end up where you want to
be where the great reward is.

60
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,080
And that's perfectly reasonable in fact
it's more than perfectly reasonable it's

61
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,960
a kind of abstraction in the same
way that function approximation is

62
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,810
a sort of attraction of the states
which you just described

63
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,528
is what we call temporal obstruction.

64
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:14,142
>> I see.
>> And

65
00:03:14,142 --> 00:03:15,815
you know that has a specific meaning but

66
00:03:15,815 --> 00:03:18,902
I think to really kind of grasp what is
the right way to think about it is you

67
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:21,520
came up with new actions
>> That's making the action

68
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,340
space bigger.

69
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,520
>> Making the action space bigger
which is a problem you would think but

70
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,100
each of these actions actually
covers an enormous amount of ground.

71
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,520
So in fact, if you had said right,
right, right, right, right, right,

72
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,510
right, right, right, down, right, right,
right, right, right, right, right,

73
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,610
right, right, down, down, down, down,
down, down, down, down, down, down,

74
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,100
down, down, down, down, down, down,
down, right or something like that,

75
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,510
that's a lot of actions to have to
reason over over a long period of time.

76
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,970
But what you actually said was, take one
action, take another action, and then,

77
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,470
I don't know, take one or two actions.

78
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,020
So we managed to do with your
new actions in, I don't know,

79
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,684
about five steps what would have
otherwise taken, I don't know,

80
00:03:55,684 --> 00:03:58,638
100 steps or maybe
>> That's cool idea.

81
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:02,650
>> Maybe 60 steps that's right that is
where the abstraction comes from and

82
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,800
where the temple nature comes from.

83
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,040
Because again, one of the things that
makes reinforcement learning hard

84
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,720
is this delayed reward, and
what's implicit in that is that you have

85
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,170
to reason over time that you have
to take many, many steps and

86
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,170
because all the options there are
several options at every state you're

87
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,450
actually getting an exponential blowup
over all the paths you might take.

88
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,490
And here what you've done is
you've traded off the price in

89
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,870
adding new actions with
being able to skip over,

90
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,060
having to make a bunch of
decisions along the way.

91
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,720
And so now I can do in five steps
would have taken 100 steps and

92
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,640
that's going to be a gigantic
exponential savings.
