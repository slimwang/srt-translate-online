1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,850
The next source of error,

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:07,730
inconsistent data across locations,
should not come as a surprise.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,870
This is the interoperability issue we've
been discussing throughout the course.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,950
Where multiple physicians are involved,
it can be further complicated

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,660
by differences in the way they document
even the same clinical issues.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,050
Particularly when text
entry is involved.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,610
For example, they might use different
terms for the same thing, or

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,550
nonstandard abbreviations or acronyms.

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,910
Similarly, physicians may not record
all the needed data leading to

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,600
misinterpretations of the past history,
or even the current treatments.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,210
Finally, where multiple locations
are involved in patient's care,

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,040
it may not be clear which
of several observations or

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,189
events is definitive or
even the most up-to-date
