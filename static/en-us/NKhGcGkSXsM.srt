00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,450
This reminds me a lot about what it
was like to work on the contacts app.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,190
I remember looking at the code base for

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,230
the very first time and
it was really overwhelming.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,660
There was just so many different files,

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,800
and it was just a maze to kind
of sort through to figure out

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,480
which files were corresponding
with which screen in the app.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,620
But slowly with the help from
tech lead and other teammates,

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,110
like I started to understand
how it all fit together.

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,010
Like I started to see
how the contact editor

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,990
would read the information from the
fields, create a content values object,

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,716
and then insert it into the database.

12
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:41,090
Or that the list of contacts was just
a query to fetch a list of contacts.

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,680
Or that the favorites page
would use a different query.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,540
It was starting to all make
sense to me over time.

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,680
And this was happening during the Ice
cream Sandwich release of Android.

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:57,050
Our team was actually charged with
revamping all of the UI in the app and

17
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,880
there was a lot of work to do
in a very short amount of time.

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,450
Luckily other team mates on
other apps finished early so

19
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,900
they were able to jump on board and
help us.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,750
And it was a little bit hectic because
there was all these new people joining

21
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,270
and I was trying to explain the code
base to them and delegate tasks to them.

22
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,330
But I don't know how it happened,
[LAUGH] but by some miracle

23
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,230
through working late nights and working
weekends, we were able to ship on time.

24
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,820
And our app actually got featured
in as part of the launch event,

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,400
which was really exciting.

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,240
So, I think my big take away from

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,980
the experience was that communication
was just really important.

28
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:40,070
In a team environment you have to be
able to talk about code with each other,

29
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,420
you have to clarify expectation if
you were giving someone a task and

30
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,480
you want it to turn out a certain way.

31
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,055
So in this exercise I want to give you
the opportunity to practice talking

32
00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:52,790
about technical concepts with people.

33
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,510
I want you to find a family member or
a friend around you and

34
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,230
describe how the app works so far.

35
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,290
Talk about how you added a SQLite
database to your app, and

36
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,710
then how you were able to query it and
get a cursor pack.

37
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,080
All of these are really tough concepts.

38
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,440
So be patient with the person
you are trying to explain it to,

39
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,200
especially if they don't
have programming experience.

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,020
And also be patient with yourself
because sometimes you'll have

41
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,100
ideas of how this concepts
work in your head.

42
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,740
But then you'll just have a very hard
time expressing it in words, and

43
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,560
I totally know how that feels.

44
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,180
So it just take a lot of practice.

45
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,930
I wish you good luck and I please share
your experiences with us in the forums.
