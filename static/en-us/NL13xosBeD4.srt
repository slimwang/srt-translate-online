00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:06,120
Sw-precache works well with either Gulp
or Grunt or any other built screen.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,460
I personally, tend towards Gulp so
I'll show you that, but

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,020
the same process applies for Grunt.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,570
Since I already have a simple Gulp
file to build parts of my project,

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,613
I first need to install sw-precache.

6
00:00:20,613 --> 00:00:22,600
Great, done.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,880
Next I need to add sw-precache
to my Gulp file and

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,195
add a new task to build
the service worker.

9
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:33,936
Sw-precache takes two parameters,
the location where I want it to

10
00:00:33,936 --> 00:00:38,740
write the service-worker to, and
the options I want it to use.

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,340
Specifying the staticFileGlobs,

12
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,390
tells it where we wanted to pre-cache
any files that match the Glob.

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,420
You can also specify runtimeCaching
options, which will cache

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,860
any other network request, specifically
the request to the weather API.

15
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,860
You can see here I've created my
task to generate the service worker,

16
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,280
and I pass it the two parameters.

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,870
The location where I want it
to write the service file to,

18
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,940
and the parameters I want it to use
to generate the service worker.
