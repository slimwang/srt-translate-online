00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,807
y equals 3x plus 4 has a y-intercept of 0 4, which is this point right here and

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,415
a slope of 3, which makes it really steep. So, it must be this line, which is

3
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:17,110
line g, so I'll check that one off. y equals 19 is a horizontal line that is

4
00:00:17,122 --> 00:00:24,913
located 19 units above the x-axis. So, if you go 19 up, we hit line d. So, those

5
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:27,883
are the two lines we need.
