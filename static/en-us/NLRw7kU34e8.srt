1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,250
So let me take this opportunity to first introduce myself.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,640
My name is Irfan Essa.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,240
One of the first things anybody who has ever taken a class with me gets to

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,050
know is how to pronounce my name.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,240
Again, it's Irfan Essa.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,100
I've been a professor here in the School of Interactive Computing at

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,700
Georgia Tech for about 18 years now.

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,130
Prior to that I actually did a master's and PhD at the MIT in the media lab

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,900
there, and actually stayed on there for a few years as a research scientist.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,580
And my whole 20 odd or

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,290
more than years of work has been in the areas of images and videos, where I've

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,080
actually been doing work on analysis and enhancement of images and videos.

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,010
And including disciplines like computer vision,

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,800
computer graphics, machine learning, and robotics.

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,910
And of course, now computational photography is also a discipline of its own,

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,000
and I've been teaching courses on it for many years.
