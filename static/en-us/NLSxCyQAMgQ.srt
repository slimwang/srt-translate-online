1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,060
So far.

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,510
We have been using
a generic UIViewController.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,190
For a playback scene.

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,120
You had just set the generic
UIViewController's UIView.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,960
To have a green background.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,820
UIViewController is a great class.

7
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,970
But we cannot add any
code to it directly.

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,510
In order to do audio playback.

9
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,910
We need a UIViewController subclass.

10
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,540
That we can add our play by code to.

11
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,560
I'm going to show you how
to create this new class,

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,470
which we will call
the Play Sounds View Controller.

13
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:33,750
With the Pitch Perfect project open in
Xcode, let's choose File > New File.

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,650
Select Source under iOS,
and then Cocoa Touch Class.

15
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,050
Click Next.

16
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,900
For the class name,
let's call it PlaySoundsViewController.

17
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,690
Set it to be a subclass
of UIViewController, and

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,560
make sure,
also create NIB file is unchecked.

19
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,040
Even though it's written as XIB
we still call it a NIB file for

20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,190
old historical purposes.

21
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,200
Make sure the language is Swift and
click next.

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,140
Here we can just make sure that
it's part of our project, and

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,940
that our project is selected as
the target and click create.

24
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,150
We can see our new
PlaySoundsViewController.swift file in

25
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,950
the project navigator.

26
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,450
There is one more step.

27
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,080
The storyboard does not know
we want to use this file for

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,200
the second view controller.

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,480
Let's walk through changing that.

30
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,480
Open the main doc storyboard, and
select the second view controller scene.

31
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,850
Be sure to click on the orange
view controller circle.

32
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,010
Open the inspectors panel by clicking
on the top right button here.

33
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,810
Select the identity inspector
as the third one from the left.

34
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,890
In the drop down for the class let's
select, play sounds view controller.

35
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,630
Press Return for it to take effect.

36
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,620
That's it.

37
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,940
Now storyboard knows to use our new
play sounds View Controller class

38
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,250
instead of just a generic
UI View Controller.
