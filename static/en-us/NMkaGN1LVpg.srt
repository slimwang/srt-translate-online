1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,380
So, I guess you could sum up optimizing

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,690
the critical rendering path, as having three main objectives.

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,630
Reducing the number of critical bytes. Reducing the number

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,410
of critical resources. And shortening the critical path length.

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,440
>> Exactly, so your job is to make the

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,210
critical rendering path as small and as short as possible.

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,885
>> Definitely, okay so I'm going to go back and run my page through

8
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:30,540
[UNKNOWN] again and this time I'll get some recommendations I can act on and

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,180
I can't wait to start optimizing my site.

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,100
>> Awesome, I'm glad to hear that. Web performance is a big topic

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,740
and there's a lot more to learn. So when you go through PHP

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,690
Insights, make sure you follow the links to learn about other things. It

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,780
all adds up in the end. Are you ready to do the final project?

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,390
>> Yeah, of course.

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,960
>> Alright, now that we've taken the full

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,130
tour through the critical rendering path, I think

17
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,720
you've got all the tools you need to make. The site render as fast as possible,

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:01,260
ideally in under one second. And Cameron's portfolio site needs a lot of work.

19
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,040
If we run it through PageSpeed Insights, we see that it's scoring pretty low.

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,720
>> As a final challenge, use what you've learned in this class to help me

21
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,950
optimize my site. Your goal is to

22
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,630
improve the PageSpeed Insight score above a 90.

23
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,220
>> Right, and to do this you'll need to do a few things. First, fork the

24
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,720
projects [UNKNOWN] repo. You can find a link

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,010
to it in the instructor notes. Then analyze

26
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,830
it using the techniques like drawing

27
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,790
the critical rendering path diagram and diagnosing

28
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,530
the. Protocol path metrics. Then apply

29
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,740
the optimizations. And publish it on GitHub

30
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,630
pages. If you're not familiar with GitHub, you can find some links in

31
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,640
the instructor notes helping you fork the repo and publish your site on GitHub.

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,790
>> Once you finish your optimizations. Run your

33
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,100
new and improved portfolio through the PageSpeed Insights.

34
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,380
You'll see all sorts of suggestions that should make some sense now, like

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,480
optimized CSS delivery and removed render

36
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,600
blocking JavaScript. When you think you've done

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,160
all the optimization you can, post what changes you made on the forums

38
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,300
along with the URL of your portfolio and the new PageSpeed Insights score.

39
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,850
>> And while you're at it, why don't you make

40
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,810
the portfolio page your own? You can use it to

41
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,510
showcase the projects you're proud of. We've got a link

42
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,410
in the instructor notes to help you out. Good luck.
