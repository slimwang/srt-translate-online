00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,340
If these are our critical regions with the probability in each region, .025 to

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:11,564
make a total alpha level of .05. And remember this is the t distribution. And

3
00:00:11,564 --> 00:00:21,589
this t value here is negative 2.042. And this t value is positive 2.042. 2.58

4
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:30,348
falls above 2.042. And if we had gone the opposite direction, negative 2.58

5
00:00:30,348 --> 00:00:37,551
falls below negative 2.042. Therefore, we'll reject the null. It appears that

6
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:42,017
meal prices in Wilma and Gettysburg are statistically different at a

7
00:00:42,017 --> 00:00:48,190
significance level of .05. If we calculate the p value, remember our t

8
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:54,259
statistic is 2.58 and our degrees of freedom is 30. GraphPad tells us that the

9
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:58,773
two-tailed p value is .015, and that is indeed less than our alpha level of

10
00:00:58,773 --> 00:01:04,370
.05. Great job. We're done with this example.
