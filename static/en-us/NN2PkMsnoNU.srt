00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,110
With print debugging,

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,160
we used individual print statements
to examine a program state.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,550
And this required us to know what
state we were interested in prior

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,630
to printing it.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,880
And we also noted that print statements
themselves can be hard to maintain.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,540
In practice, there's a better way to
debug that offers us the maximum amount

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,600
of state information available
at any given point of execution.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,190
I'm talking about breakpoint debugging
or debugging by using breakpoints.

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,540
Breakpoints let developers pause
the execution of a program, so

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,299
they're able to see all
the program state available at

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,465
a point at which
the breakpoint was reached.

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,435
Xcode makes break points
extremely easy to use.

13
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:40,595
It only takes one simple click.

14
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:44,225
In fact, you've already probably set
some break points by accident, but

15
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:45,685
let's do so on purpose now.
