00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,190
Hi, welcome to
the Time Series Forecasting course.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,785
Before we dive into any lessons,

3
00:00:05,785 --> 00:00:09,640
let's examine what exactly
time series forecasting is.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,030
Well, to put it simply, time series
forecasting is the use of a statistical

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,530
model to predict future values,
based on past results.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,980
So what kinds of variables
can we forecast?

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,790
Any value that can be tracked and
collected over time.

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,670
Think of annual population data,
a company's daily stock price or

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,330
quarterly sales figures.

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,260
For each of these examples,
data is collected over time and

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,130
the time series model is simply using
that data to forecast future values.

12
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,020
During the course, we'll answer
questions like how do I define time?

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,545
Or what are trends?

14
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:43,760
[LAUGH] Not that kind of trend.

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,120
And what are seasonal patterns?

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,340
We'll also dig into how to use
particular forecasting models

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,220
like an Exponential Smoothing or ETS,

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,400
and an Autoregressive Integrated
Moving Average or ARIMA models.

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,060
Along the way we will be working
through a specific business problem

20
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,620
in Alteryx designer to examine
these topics in more detail.

21
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,430
Now wait.

22
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,920
Do you need to be an expert in
all Alteryx prior to this course?

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,889
Not at all.

24
00:01:06,889 --> 00:01:10,511
Luckily, you've been working with our
pros here at Alteryx in previous courses

25
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:13,818
and I'll help continue painting your
analytical picture on the designer

26
00:01:13,818 --> 00:01:14,261
canvas.

27
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:18,718
But first, let's briefly look at
where time series forecasting fits

28
00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:21,146
relative to other types of analysis.

29
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:24,938
In the Problem Solving with Advanced
Analytics course, you're introduced to

30
00:01:24,938 --> 00:01:28,391
Methodology Map which is used to
determine which methodology is best for

31
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:29,950
a particular analysis.

32
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,660
So, with our business problem, we need
to identify if we're doing data analysis

33
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,330
or trying to predict an outcome.

34
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,380
This one's easy,

35
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,910
we're trying to predict future
values based on past observations.

36
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,691
Next, we'll continue along
in the Data Rich branch and

37
00:01:43,691 --> 00:01:45,475
into our Numeric family of models.

38
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:48,550
The time series will need a numeric
variable that we'd like to predict.

39
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,130
This is our target variable.

40
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,430
And it also needs a time based variable.

41
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,614
Think about our examples.

42
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:57,500
Year over year population,
a stock's daily closing price and

43
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,640
lastly, our quarterly sales figures.

44
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,890
All of this are numeric variables.

45
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,120
The data for these examples
are collected by year, day, and

46
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,780
quarter, respectively.

47
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,410
So each observation has
a time component to it.

48
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,680
If the business problem involves
predicting these values into the future,

49
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,360
then time series forecasting
models like ARIMA and

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,160
ETS models will be most appropriate.
