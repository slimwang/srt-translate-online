1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,969
From the documentation, 
we want single choiceMode

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,080
so that the list item only shows 
one selected item at a time.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,020
We can declare this attribute 
on the ListView

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,428
in the fragment_main file.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,620
However, we don't want to specify 
choiceMode in one pane mode.

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,406
To have these different code paths,

7
00:00:14,406 --> 00:00:16,562
we could copy the file 
in the Layout folder

8
00:00:16,562 --> 00:00:19,550
and put it in the Layout-sw600dp folder.

9
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,775
A better solution is to declare a style,

10
00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:24,810
so we have one layout file 
but different styles.

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,304
In the Base styles file 
in the Values folder,

12
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:29,111
we declare ForecastListStyle.

13
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:32,031
We leave it empty because we don't need
to specify choiceMode.

14
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:35,960
We create a new styles file 
in the values-sw600dp folder.

15
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:37,217
In the two-pane case,

16
00:00:37,217 --> 00:00:40,097
the ForecastListStyle 
does include the choiceMode.

17
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,541
The two files have a different 
number of styles.

18
00:00:42,895 --> 00:00:44,647
If it's not declared a higher folder,

19
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:46,610
then it will just fall back
to the Base style.
