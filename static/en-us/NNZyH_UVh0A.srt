1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,240
What we're showing here is
a picture of high magnification,

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,070
probably a electron micrograph,
then pseudo colored, of your retina.

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,960
And you can see that retina is
made up of two kinds of receptors

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,650
called rods and cones, and we'll talk
more about the differences between them

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,540
when we do the human
anatomy conversation.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,990
But today,
all we're going to talk about is cones.

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,710
And in particular, there are several
million cones in the retina.

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,780
They tend to be focused more or grouped
more in the, near the fovea, the middle.

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,500
They're responsible for
the high-resolution imagery.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,160
That is your ability to see very

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,805
sort of with a good resolution at
the center of your visual field.

12
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:41,055
And most importantly, for
today's conversation,

13
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:44,125
it's your cones that discriminate color.

14
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,935
That is that they're sensitive
to different wavelengths, and

15
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:50,625
your, your visual system uses
the outputs of the cones,

16
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,975
processed through a variety
of channels to see color.

17
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:57,425
And particularly there are three
types of cones that are called red,

18
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:58,880
green, and blue.

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,400
That's not really quite correct,
you'll see why in a minute.

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,110
They really should be called long,
medium, and short.

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,190
And you'll also see it's written here
that the vast majority of them are red

22
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,510
and green and a very small
percentage of them are blue.

23
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,320
All right.

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,530
So, this is a graph of the sensitivity

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,940
of each of these three types of cones,
roughly red, green and blue, in terms of

26
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:30,690
how responsive they are as a function of
a single band of wavelength of light.

27
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,380
So here you see the wavelength of
the light expressed in nanometers, and

28
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,970
you can see that there's
one channel right here that

29
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,640
starts at the longer range and
peaks somewhere around there.

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,330
And then there's another one that's
called green even though it's

31
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,300
really just offset
a little bit from that.

32
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,450
And then finally,
what's called the blue,

33
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,447
which is really the short
wavelength cone.

34
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,940
If you were to make a picture of sort
of the retinal mosaic and you colored

35
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,680
the cones, what you'd see would be
a picture that looks kind of like this.

36
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,440
You'll notice that in the middle,
there's hardly any blue cones at all and

37
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,160
there's some more of them out here,
all right.

38
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,470
But basically almost all of the cones
that are used are in the red and green.

39
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,350
And the the blue is really just
there for a little bit of coverage.

40
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,680
And yet we see color very, very well.
