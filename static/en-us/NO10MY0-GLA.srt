00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,469
As it turns out,
it's actually linear in most cases.

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,876
There can be cases where it's more or
less expensive than linear but

3
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:08,189
that depends on whether or

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,208
not you're using expensive styles which
you'll learn more about in a moment.

5
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:16,366
So this means that changing 1,000
elements is roughly ten times more

6
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:19,126
expensive than only
changing 100 elements.

00:00:19,126 --> 00:00:22,130
This is important to keep in mind when
you have a page with a lot going on.
