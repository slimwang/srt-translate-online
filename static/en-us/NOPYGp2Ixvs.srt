1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,760
The final thing you'll want to do to
secure the authentication process

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,520
is to disable the password base logins.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,800
This will force all of your users to
only be able to login using a key pair.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,450
To do this, you'll have to edit
the configuration file for SSHD.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,340
Which is the service that's running
on the server listening for

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,290
all of your SSH connections.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:25,250
This configuration file is
located at etc/ssh/sshd_config.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,770
And you can edit it using sudo nano.

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,300
There are a lot of options in here, and
you can read through them all to get

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,470
a better understanding of
how SSH is configured.

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,300
The comment lines start
with the hash symbol here.

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,690
And they're pretty good at
explaining what everything does.

13
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:46,000
The line we're looking for is right
here, PasswordAuthentication yes.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,978
We just want to change that to no,
and then we'll save the file.

15
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:53,559
Now, the SSHD service is
currently running, and

16
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:57,540
it only reads its configuration file
when it's initially started up.

17
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,580
So we need to restart the service so

18
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,880
it runs with the new configuration
option we just made.

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,390
We restart the service by
sudo service ssh restart and

20
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,750
that's all there is to it.

21
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,040
Now all users will be forced
to log in using a key pair.

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,110
SSH will not allow users to log in with
a user name and password any longer.
