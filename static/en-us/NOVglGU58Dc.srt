1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,400
As we go through the report results,
keep in mind that,

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:07,910
depending on your selections and
all of the configuration settings and

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,820
because the starting seeds are
randomized, the actual results may vary.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,660
What you should focus on
as we go through this

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,890
are the concepts in
interpreting the results.

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,350
Let's open the results
up in a new window, so

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,650
they're more easily able to be seen.

8
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,570
The first table shows
the results of the clusters.

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,820
The cluster numbers themselves
are just arbitrary identifiers.

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,609
The size column tells us how many
objects are in each of the clusters.

11
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:39,149
If one of the clusters had
a really small number of objects

12
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,710
relative to the total number of objects,
that might indicate that the variables

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,009
related to those specific
objects are really unusual or

14
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:50,409
could be considered
outliers in themselves, and

15
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:54,439
you might want to look specifically
at why this is the case.

16
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:57,479
The next column reports
the average distance.

17
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,250
This represents the average distance
of each observation within the cluster

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,560
to the centroid of the cluster.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,609
When comparing clusters, the clusters
with the smallest average distance

20
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:12,989
are the most compact of the clusters,
and the ones with the higher average

21
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:17,729
are less compact and might show
more variability in the results.

22
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,000
The maximum distance column shows
the distance of the observation that is

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,120
farthest from the centroid.

24
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,079
Since this could be just a single
point with all the other points

25
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,799
relatively close to the centroid, this
isn't of much use other than to show

26
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,230
how far out the farthest outlier is.

27
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,010
Separation shows the distance
of the closest point

28
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,570
not in the relevant cluster.

29
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:47,489
So here, the larger the number,
the more separation there is between

30
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:52,109
that cluster and all of the other
clusters and the better for the model.

31
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:56,629
The chart with the individual variables
showing can best be used a way to

32
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:58,849
characterize each cluster.

33
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:03,939
To do this, it is best to use
it within variable comparisons.

34
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:07,969
In other words,
you don't look across horizontally but

35
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:12,210
compare the cluster results only for
a specific variable.

36
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,110
So that when you look at the numbers
represented within the same variable,

37
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,920
a high positive versus a high
negative would indicate that for

38
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,699
that variable, those two clusters
are opposite of each other.

39
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:29,739
For example, if you look within
the Snow variable for PC1,

40
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,960
cluster 6, with the largest
positive value, and cluster 7,

41
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,790
with the largest negative value, are
the extreme clusters related to snow,

42
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:44,549
one with potentially lots of snowfall
and the other with little snowfall.

43
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,200
Now, keep in mind as you interpret
these numbers that the positive and

44
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:54,329
negatives indications don't necessarily
correlate with most snow and

45
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,240
least snow respectively but
just that they are the most different.

46
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,370
In other words, in this example,
the most snow could actually have

47
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,780
a negative indicator, and the least
snow could have a positive indicator.

48
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,590
We'll be able to determine that when
we start validating the results.

49
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,770
For example, I've seen cluster
solutions where there were only four or

50
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,930
five stores in a cluster.

51
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,580
When looking at these
store characteristics,

52
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,870
they were stores that were
intentionally configured differently

53
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,170
from an operational standpoint.

54
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:30,859
We actually ended up excluding those
stores from the cluster analysis

55
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,400
entirely, and this then created
a better clustering solution for

56
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,319
the remaining stores.
