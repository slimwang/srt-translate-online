1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,590
So the first malware, an email
attachment that when being opened

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,620
will send itself to all people
in the user's address book.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,180
As we have discussed a little
bit earlier, this is a virus.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,410
The second malware, a customized
keyboard app that logs user input and

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,670
sends it to a server on the Internet.

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,160
This is a Trojan Horse, because while
it performs some useful function,

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,890
it also performs some
malicious activities.

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,060
The third malware, part of a program
that will only run if the computer

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:34,220
is at the user's home and it will upload
Microsoft Word documents to a website.

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,210
This is a logic bomb, because
the triggering condition is the place or

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,010
geolocation or
IP address of the computer.

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,750
Which is at the user's home.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,490
And when the triggering condition is
met, it performs malicious activities.

14
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,170
The fourth malware, login program
with an undocumented option, for

15
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,070
example DEBUG, that would allow
an attacker to supply any username and

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,820
password to gain access to the computer.

17
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,470
This is a trap door, because it allows
an attacker to gain access to system

18
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,550
without going through
the proper security check.
