00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,760
Okay so here are the two steps that we need to do on the top right hand corner.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,440
Let's add them to our cord.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,430
Now we're looking at, record sounds view controller and what I'm going to do,

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,370
is add AV audio recorder delegate to the class declaration.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,120
There, step one is done.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,790
For step two, I will scroll down to the record audio function.

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,490
Where we are initializing audio recorder.

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:31,350
And in here, I will say AudioRecorder.Delegate is equal to self.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,740
So this means that audio recorders new delegate is self or

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,040
our class record sounds, view controller.

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,280
Now that I've finished both of these steps, I can start typing,

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,910
audio recorder did finish recording and as soon as I type that.

13
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,850
X code auto completes it for me.

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,580
Now this method will be invoked, when the audio has finished recording.

15
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,760
I will start writing code here soon.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,200
But before we continue,

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,220
let me connect some of the new ideas we've seen recently.

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,710
One of the classes we've been using is called AVAudioRecorder.

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,490
Now, this class was written by Apple.

20
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,400
Among other things, it has a variable defined in it called delegate.

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,860
Now, the type of this variable, is not a string, not an integer.

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,320
But it's something called AVAudioRecorderDelegate.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,480
What this is, is a simple list of methods.

24
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,090
One of which is called, audioRecroderDidFinishRecording.

25
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,850
So, in our class, which is RecodSoundsViewController.

26
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,020
When we see a line of code like this, what we are really saying,

27
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,780
is that we are becoming audioRecorder.delegate and

28
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,080
at that point, we can implement all of these methods.

29
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,730
By the way, don't take my word for any of this, you can go back to Xcode.

30
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,820
And use the Cmd key on your keyboard, to look through AVAudioRecorder and

31
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,650
confirm this relationship.

32
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,870
Once you've done that, I encourage you to come back to this quiz and

33
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,100
summarize everything you've learned about delegates in this box.
