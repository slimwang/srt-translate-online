We need to define the screen-name
variable, because we use it in the code.

00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,046
So, this is the code where we mapped the
name of the screen to the screen-name.

00:00:09,046 --> 00:00:13,580
I used a hyphen, and it doesn't matter
if you use a hyphen or an underscore.

00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,440
The key thing is that
the key in the code

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,460
is exactly the same as you configure
the data layer variable name to.
