1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,190
The answer is q of p of n. It's tempting to think, that we run M,

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,990
and then we run N, so the running time should be the sum of the two polynomials.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,940
The trouble is, that this doesn't account for

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,900
the possibility, that the output of M, could be much longer than the input.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,340
In fact, it could be almost p of n. Most of the program's instructions,

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,110
could have been print statements or rights to the end of the tape for

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,070
Turing machines. So that the input to n, is p of n long.

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,340
N would then take q of p of n time, and that becomes the dominant factor.
