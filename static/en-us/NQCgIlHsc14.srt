1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,760
The only prior knowledge you need for

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,900
this lesson is a familiarity with the
basics of graphs and graph traverses.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,030
You should know what a graph is and
the difference between directed and

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,940
undirected graphs.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,990
You should be familiar with the common
vocabulary surrounding graphs

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,670
such as vertex degree.

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,799
The ideas of neighbors and
neighborhoods and paths in graphs.

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,870
And we will also assume that you are
familiar with the basic graph traversal

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,470
algorithms like Depth-first search and
Breadth-first search and

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,040
their running times.

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,290
The plan for the lesson is this.

12
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,630
We begin by introducing the necessary
definitions for a flow network,

13
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:40,070
flow capacities, and residual networks,
and residual capacities.

14
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,750
Then, we present
the Ford-Fulkerson method, and

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,630
show that it finds a maximum flow with
the help of a theorem that shows that

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:51,110
the maximum flow in a network is
actually equal to the minimum cut.

17
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,160
Finally, we discuss two variations on
the Ford-Fulkerson method, showing

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,790
that these algorithms make it much more
efficient than a naive version would be.

19
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,090
This lecture will follow most closely
the treatment in Kleinberg and

20
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,720
Tardos, Algorithm Design, but any
reference on the subject should suffice.
