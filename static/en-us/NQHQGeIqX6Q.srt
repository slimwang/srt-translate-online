1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,750
So after the get number of characters method I'll add another method. From the

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,067
fact sheet we can see that the index of method will help us. We want to return

3
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:15,364
bookText.indexOf Mad hatter. Now we need to add that line to our test program,

4
00:00:15,364 --> 00:00:18,004
BookTester which prints out the actual value of

5
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:24,445
Alice.firstOccurrenceOfMadHatter, looks like I capitalized it wrong. Alright,

6
00:00:24,445 --> 00:00:29,435
now let's see what this actually gives us. Huh, the actual value is negative

7
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:34,715
one. That doesn't sound like a location. There shouldn't be a minus one

8
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:38,700
character in the book. Let's look at the documentation. In my browser, I'll

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,930
search for java 7 string and find the official documentation. And then I'm

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,065
going to look for the index of method. Methods, index of, we're giving it a

11
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:52,461
string. Alright, returns the index within this string of the first occurrence

12
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:57,237
of the specified substring. That's what we were expecting. The returned index

13
00:00:57,237 --> 00:01:03,083
is the smallest value, k, for which this dot starts with stir, k. Not sure what

14
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:07,762
that means yet, we can think about that later. If no such value of k exists.

15
00:01:07,762 --> 00:01:12,869
Then minus 1 is returned. Okay, so minus 1 means that there are no occurrences

16
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:17,148
of Mad Hatter as we wrote it in the book. This might be surprising. The Mad

17
00:01:17,148 --> 00:01:21,570
Hatter is a famous charater. But it turns out, in the book, he's always just

18
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,050
called the Hatter, not the Mad Hatter.
