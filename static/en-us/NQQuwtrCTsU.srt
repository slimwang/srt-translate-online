1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,740
Here I am in the code.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,500
I've tried my best to keep
things modular for you.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,109
Here is this AudioVisuals folder,
and inside of it is all the code for

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,349
the audio playback and
visualization of the audio.

5
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:13,619
You're welcome to take a look at this,
but

6
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:17,559
you won't actually need to modify
any of these classes in this lesson.

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,479
Your only interaction with this code
will be the visualizer view class,

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,850
which if you scroll down to the bottom,

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,600
you will see has a bunch of center
methods that you will be working with.

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,371
The classes that you will be directly
modifying will all be outside of this

11
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:33,960
AudioVisuals folder.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,460
And you've only got one right now,
which is the visualizer activity.

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,620
Visualizer activity is the activity
that actually shows our visualization.

14
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:44,250
During this lesson,
you'll be creating a settings activity

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,869
to go along with this
visualization activity.

16
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:48,750
Here's the code for visualizer activity.

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,929
Looking at this code, we can see that
we've got a default setup method,

18
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:56,189
this calls those setter methods
that we saw in VisualizerView.

19
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,500
If you scroll down further, you'll
also see that there's some code for

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,460
permissions.

21
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,660
This permission code you
do not need to modify for

22
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:05,909
this lesson,
setupPermissions is called an onCreate.

23
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:08,670
And it's basically just making
sure that the user has the correct

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,840
audio permissions before even
trying to play the audio and

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,689
launching the visualization code.

26
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:17,539
If the user's on Android M or later,
they'll see a permission screen.

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,310
And if you'll scroll down, you'll see
that once they've responded to that

28
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,760
permission screen, OnRequest
permission result will be called.

29
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,109
If they accepted the permission,
which is checked here,

30
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:30,420
a new audio input reader object is
created and the visualization starts.

31
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,430
If not, the visualization exits
with a helpful error message.

32
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,000
And well, beyond that, there isn't
really much else in the class.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,760
Let's see what this code
looks like when we run it.

34
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,920
Now as I mentioned,

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,829
I already have all the code to
actually change the visualization.

36
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:48,670
I can do this by calling
the methods on the VisuaizerView,

37
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,239
just like you see here in
the default setup method.

38
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,289
These are all of the methods
that you can call.

39
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,520
They are: setShowBass, setShowMid,

40
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,149
setShowTreble, setMidScaleSize and
setColor.

41
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,090
The color is currently a string which
can be found in your string resource

42
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,560
file, which if you don't remember,
is right here.

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,099
Here are the other colors
currently available.

44
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:15,060
If I wanted to change the visualizer
to be blue and just show the base and

45
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,979
double the current size of the circle,

46
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:19,769
I could call these methods
a little bit differently.

47
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,920
For example, I could hide these two,

48
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:27,519
multiply the minimum size by 2 and
change this to blue.

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,490
All right, let's try edit again.

50
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,443
[SOUND] Cool.

51
00:02:30,443 --> 00:02:33,146
So, we can see that these
changes are possible, but

52
00:02:33,145 --> 00:02:37,269
there's nowhere in the UI that I
can trigger those sorts of changes.

53
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,460
That's the goal of this lesson.
