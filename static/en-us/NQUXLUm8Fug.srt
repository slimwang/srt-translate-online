1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,280
You just added a powerful user to your
server that authenticates using a user

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,790
name and password.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,100
Hopefully, you chose a strong password
since attackers will soon start running

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,730
bots against your server attempting to
guess any valid usernames and passwords.

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,160
This is going to cause all sorts
of issues for your server.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,040
Your logs are going to be filled
with invalid login attempts, and

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,710
if one of these hackers
manages to gain access,

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,820
well that's about the worst
thing we could possibly imagine.

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,480
There's another way to perform user
authentication that's much more secure.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,345
It doesn't rely on passwords, which
we're pretty horrible at making secure,

11
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:36,305
since we have to make them
simple enough to memorize.

12
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:40,175
Instead, this form of authentication,
called key based authentication,

13
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:42,865
relies on physical files
located on the server and

14
00:00:42,865 --> 00:00:45,015
your personal machine,
the one you're logging in from.

15
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:48,435
Before we get into key
based authentication,

16
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:51,575
let's demonstrate how public
key encryption generally works.
