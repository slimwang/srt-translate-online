1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And this time we only have one correct answer,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
which is this one up here.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So once we know that SAT is NP-complete

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and we wanted to show that those three problems,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
vertex cover, independent SET, and clique are NP-complete as well,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
we would have to show that if we take any input for SAT,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
then we can transform it into one of

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
those three problems up here and then solve that.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Because that shows us that in a way vertex cover or independent SET

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
or clique are at least as hard to solve as SAT.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And because SAT is NP-complete,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
if one of these problems is at least as hard to solve,

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
then that problem must be NP-complete as well.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
These two down here are the wrong way around

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
because SAT is NP-complete,

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
which means that this is one of the

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
hardest problems that you will find in NP,

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
so just showing that for example,

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
you could take vertex cover and transform it into an input for SAT

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
would only show you that SAT is at least as hard to solve as vertex cover,

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
but that is the wrong way around,

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
because we want to show that vertex cover is at least as hard to solve as SAT,

23
00:01:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so those two answers down here are not correct.
