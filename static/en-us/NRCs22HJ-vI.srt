00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,880
Happy birthday!

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,490
The zoo has some new-born baby possums.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,380
Let's add them to the database.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,140
To do that, we need a different SQL
statement, the insert statement.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,120
Insert adds a row to a table.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,870
When you write an insert,
you tell the database,

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,880
what values to put into
the columns of that table.

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,650
If the new values aren't in the same
order, as the table's columns,.

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,540
Then you also have to tell it
what columns they go into.

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,880
On the next page,
you'll see two queries in the editor.

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,620
One of them is the select query and
the other is an insert.

12
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,610
Your job is to fill in the second query,
with the right insert statement.

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,530
When you press the test run or
submit button, you'll see the results of

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,790
the select before the insert, and
then the results after the insert.

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,130
And here's what we'd like to do.

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,840
Find the opossums that
are already in the table, and

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,760
add the newborn opossum to the table.
