00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,566
So, why is REM sleep important? Well first, we can look for answers in sleep

2
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:08,835
patterns that occur across the lifetime. We see that REM sleep steadily

3
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:14,202
decreases from infancy to adulthood. For example, REM goes from about 50% of

4
00:00:14,202 --> 00:00:19,142
total sleep time in infancy, to around 20% of total sleep time in childhood and

5
00:00:19,142 --> 00:00:25,834
adulthood. However, then it increases slightly to around 23% of total sleep

6
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:31,905
time in old age. So for most of our life, we spend about 20 to 25% of sleep in

7
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:36,880
REM sleep. Now, if you remember from our previous lessons when we talked about

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,300
REM sleep, REM sleep is associated with neural growth.
