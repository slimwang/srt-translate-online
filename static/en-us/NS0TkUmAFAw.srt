00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,370
So for the last step in implementing our hash table. Your

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,800
goal is to define a procedure, we'll call it hashtable_update. It takes

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,400
three inputs the hash table, the key, and the value. And

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,440
what it should do is update the value associated with that key.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,980
So if the key is already in the table, then instead

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,130
of creating a new entry like were doing before with add. What

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,080
we want to do is change the value associated with that key,

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,380
to be the new value that's passed in. If it's not already

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,820
in the table, then what we want to do is

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,540
add a new entry, that has that key associated

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,510
with this value. This is going to be a pretty

12
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,930
complicated procedure. I think it's the most complex procedure you've

13
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,820
been asked to define so far. But if you

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,790
think about it carefully and put together all the things

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,780
we've seen so far, and understand how the hash-table

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,090
works, I think you'll be able to define it yourself.
