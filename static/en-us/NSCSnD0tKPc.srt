00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,630
We're almost there.

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,960
If you know beforehand that you're going
to search or sort objects by a certain

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,870
property, you should mark those
attributes as indexed in the data model.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,900
This will make it easier for

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,680
the database to improve
the performance of your app.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,750
So, let's go ahead and index name and
creation date in both entities.

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,830
Now, go ahead and
do this in your app as well.
