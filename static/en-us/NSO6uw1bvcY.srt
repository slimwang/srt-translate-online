1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,466
This would be the numerator and this would be the denominator, fantastic algebra

2
00:00:04,466 --> 00:00:08,406
skills if you figure those two out. Now, I know you might have never seen this

3
00:00:08,406 --> 00:00:12,990
being distributed to a fraction. Lets see how we can do that. We'll distribute

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,482
the 8x to each term in the numerator and to each term in the denominator. This

5
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:22,682
pare is the easiest of the multiplications we'll have 6 times 8x, which is 48x,

6
00:00:22,682 --> 00:00:27,280
for the second one the x's will cancel. We will have an x in the numerator and

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,384
an x in the denominator. So we'll be left with 3 times 8 which equals 24. If

8
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:37,328
that seems a little off to you, think of 8x as 8x divided by 1. You know x

9
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:42,816
divided by x equals 1. So we're left with 3 times 8 which equals 24. For this

10
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:48,796
multiplication 8 divided by 4 equals 2. So we're left with x times 2 x, which

11
00:00:48,796 --> 00:00:55,130
equals 2 x squared. And finally, for the last one, 1 8th of 8x would just be 1

12
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:00,174
x. 8 divided by 8 equals 1, so we're left with 1 x.
