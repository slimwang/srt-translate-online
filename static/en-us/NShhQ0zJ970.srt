00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,310
To solve this problem, we want to use power divided by root for each of our

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:10,430
factors. So for x we'll have 7 divided by 3. For y we'll have 5 divided by 3.

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,708
And for z we'll have 10 divided by 3. Since 7 divided by 3 is 2 remainder 1,

4
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:18,788
we'll have x squared on the outside and x to the 1 on the inside of our cubed

5
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:25,325
root. For y, we'll have 1y on the outside and we'll have y squared left on the

6
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:30,890
inside. And finally for z, we'll have z cubed on the outside, and 1z on the

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:36,500
inside of our cube root. This is our final result. We could have also

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,680
completely expanded this radicand. Once we have all the factors listed out, we

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,490
want to find the factors that appear three times. That means we can pull it

10
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,732
out. Here's a group of three xs. And here's a group of three xs. So we can pull

11
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:53,915
out an x and an x. We can also pull out one y, and we can pull out three zs.

12
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:58,131
These other factors don't appear in a triple, so we leave them inside of our

13
00:00:58,131 --> 00:01:03,821
cube root. X, y squared, z. And finally, we just rewrite the front part of our

14
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:09,673
radical to get x squared y z cubed times the cubed root of xy squared z.
