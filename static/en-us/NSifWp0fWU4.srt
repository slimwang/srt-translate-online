00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,320
So what is Docker?

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,520
Docker is an open source tool that makes
it easier to create, distribute, and

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,990
run applications.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,250
It does this by packaging applications
as a set of container images that

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,110
include all of the dependencies
bundled with it.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,580
Container images can be run on any
machine where Docker is installed

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,490
which means containers or
assist admins dream come true.

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,570
Reproducable and Consistant.

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,410
Containers like processes start up and
shut down quickly.

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,380
We're talking milliseconds here.

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,790
At the same time, containers provide
the benefits of a virtual machine like

12
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,320
isolation between applications
running on the same machine.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,040
This means we don't have to worry
about conflicting dependencies between

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,580
our apps.

15
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,280
For this course, we use Docker
to package, distribute, and

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,170
run our application.
