00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,986
Let's draw a diagrams that we can better visualize what's going on. Here's mu

2
00:00:04,986 --> 00:00:09,684
which is 7.47 and we want to know if the new population parameter will be

3
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:15,740
significantly different. We decided significantly different if it falls in the

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:21,805
critical region. Remember that the z score here for an alpha level of .05 is

5
00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:28,614
1.96. and negative 1.96. Where does the real population mean fall in the

6
00:00:28,614 --> 00:00:33,408
distribution of sample means? Remember, that the standard deviation, of this

7
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:37,830
distribution, is the population standard deviation divided by the square root

8
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:48,954
of n. So the z-score of 7.8 is 7.8 minus 7.47. Divided by 2.41, divided by the

9
00:00:48,954 --> 00:00:55,788
square root of 30. This is about 0.75. Since 0.75 is less than this z critical

10
00:00:55,788 --> 00:00:59,948
value, but greater than this z critical value, the true population mean does

11
00:00:59,948 --> 00:01:05,642
not fall within the critical region. But we don't know this, we base our

12
00:01:05,642 --> 00:01:10,734
decision off of our sample. If we find the z score of our sample, We do the

13
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:15,396
same thing that we did here, but instead eight point three minus seven point

14
00:01:15,396 --> 00:01:22,635
four seven divided by two point four one over root 30. And this is about one

15
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:27,243
point eight night. Therefore, our sample statistic also falls outside the

16
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:31,212
critical region Based on the results of this sample, we would fail to reject

17
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:37,468
the null, and in this case we made the right decision. Because this population

18
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:41,956
parameter also falls outside the critical region, close enough to the current

19
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:47,246
population mean. Since we retained the null when the null was true, then this

20
00:01:47,246 --> 00:01:50,213
quadrant represents what happened.
