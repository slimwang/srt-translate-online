1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,650
The first one an employee uses a laptop
on the company network and at home.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,060
In this case a personal
firewall is required because

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,420
when the employee takes the laptop
to his home it needs protection.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,440
That is when the laptop is at home it
is not protected by the conventional

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,360
network firewall at a company, so
it requires a personal firewall.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,120
The second one,
an employee uses a desktop

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,450
on the company network to
access websites worldwide.

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,980
In this case, it does not require
a personal firewall because the desktop

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,250
is within the company's network.

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,850
The third case, a remote employee
uses a desktop to create a VPN

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,020
on the company's secure network.

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,280
In this case,
a personal firewall is required.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,060
In fact, a personal firewall on
a desktop is typically used to create

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:53,140
a VPN, so that the remote desktop can
access the company's secure network.

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,330
And obviously,
this last statement is false.
