1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,580
This middle choice, f of x equals x plus 1 times x minus 2 times x plus 5 times

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:11,978
x minus 4, is the only one that could be the factorization of this polynomial.

3
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:16,332
Remember that all the constants we have in our original factors must multiply

4
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:22,640
to equal this constant out here, 40. We can double check that 1 times negative

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,100
2 times 5 times negative 4 does in fact equal 40. That's not the case for

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,159
either of these.
