1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,446
This time, we need to use the output of 
the function g of x, so the square root

2
00:00:04,446 --> 00:00:08,900
of 4 minus x squared, as the input into f 
of x.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,910
That means we need to square the 
expression for g of x and then subtract 4.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,329
Let's see what happens. 
Squaring a square root just gives us

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:21,820
what's underneath the radical sign. 
So we get four minus x squared minus 4.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,880
It means out answer is just negative x 
squared.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,282
Now if you want to eventually grap 
composite functions, we're going to need

8
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:32,481
to consider their domains. 
Before I ask you what the domain of f of

9
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:36,110
g of x is, lets do a quick review of 
domain.
