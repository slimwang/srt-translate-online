00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,790
Now that you've learned
a bit about VR displays,

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,939
let's think about low-persistence again.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,881
So why do VR displays
use low-persistence?

4
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:14,997
Is it because it increases
the brightness of the display or

5
00:00:14,997 --> 00:00:18,442
it reduces motion blur
while turning your head?

6
00:00:18,442 --> 00:00:22,240
Or is because it increases
the display resolution?
