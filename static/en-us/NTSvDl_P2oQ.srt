1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,142
We've just seen that labels and

2
00:00:03,142 --> 00:00:07,668
text fields have the same
compression resistance, 750.

3
00:00:07,668 --> 00:00:09,375
That's a pretty high value.

4
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:14,141
What this means is that once they
reach their intrinsic content size,

5
00:00:14,141 --> 00:00:17,625
squeezing them requires a lot of effort.

6
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:22,315
Some other view of the lower compression
resistance is inside the stack view.

7
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:24,325
That's the one that will be crushed.

8
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,414
On the other hand,
the content hugging of a label is

9
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:30,179
slightly higher than
that of a text field.

10
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:36,460
This means that a text field will
increase its width before a label does.

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,259
I have some homework for you now.

12
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:41,750
Write down on a piece of paper
a table with a content hugging and

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,881
compression resistance
of the following views.

14
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:52,167
A label, a text field, a button,
a slider and an image view.

15
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:54,509
Can you see some pattern there?

16
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:58,629
Are labels and
image views different from other views?

17
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,550
Try to make some sense out
of what you found out.
