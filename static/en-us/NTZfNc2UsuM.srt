1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,000
Now that we finished building out a home
for our weather data, it's time to

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,050
consider how to make sure that data
can be updated in the background.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,610
One of the most powerful features of
Android has always been the ability for

4
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:13,549
any app to run in the background.

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,740
As is usually the case though, with
great power comes great responsibility.

6
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:21,139
So if you're building an app that has
significant background components,

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,490
you need to be very conscious
of how it's consuming resources.

8
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:28,229
A poorly behaved background app can
have a seriously negative impact on

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,859
the overall user experience.

10
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:31,589
In this lesson,

11
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,350
you'll learn more about how the Android
framework manages background apps.

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,740
You'll be introduced to the two final
Android components, the service and

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,380
broadcast receiver.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,260
And you'll be introduced to Jobs,

15
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:45,509
the new way Android is
having background tasks.

16
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:48,879
And running in the background wouldn't
be complete without being able to notify

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,260
users when something
important has happened.

18
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,809
So you'll also learn how to send
notifications when your app is running

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,380
in the background.
