1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer I'm looking for, obviously, is the thing we just talked about--

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
replicate the database.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now, yes, you can get a faster machine,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but sometimes you don't have access to a faster machine,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and that's obviously not what I was asking.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Of course, you can store less data.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That was something we used to say. I read it all the time.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This site would be a lot faster if we didn't have any users.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Or you could press the turbo button,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
which is really just a subset of get a faster machine.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I don't know if you guys remember computers with turbo buttons,

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but they were pretty cool.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But the answer I'm looking for is replicate the database.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you take your database and you replicate the data

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to a bunch of different machines, you can do more reads.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So, all right, next quiz.
