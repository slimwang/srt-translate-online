00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,911
Now, we might not just be interested in the absolute numbers, but instead, how

2
00:00:04,923 --> 00:00:09,775
these numbers relate to each other. In other words, we might want to know the

3
00:00:09,787 --> 00:00:14,971
proportion of students from each country, understanding how many students from

4
00:00:14,983 --> 00:00:19,888
each country make up the whole. This is called the relative frquency. For

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:26,827
example, 2 out of 50 students in this sample are from Canada, 2 divided by 50 is

6
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:33,767
0.04. 0.04 is the proportion of students from Canada. Try calculating

00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:38,209
proportions yourself for China, Germany, and Japan.
