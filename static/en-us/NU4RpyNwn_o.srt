00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,865
This first one y equals 3x squared plus 12x plus 20 is a quadratic function. And

2
00:00:06,865 --> 00:00:12,945
the second, y equals 4x cubed minus 24x squared plus 35x is a cubic function.

3
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:16,530
Now both of these names might remind you of some stuff that you learned during

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,114
our polynomial section at the beginning of the course and that makes perfect

5
00:00:20,114 --> 00:00:24,288
sense. The names of these types of functions refer to the degree of either one

6
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:29,300
of them. So cubic refers to the fact that this is of degree 3, and quadratic

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,183
refers to the fact that this is of degree 2.
