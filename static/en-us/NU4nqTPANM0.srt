1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's what I'm going to do.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm going to start out by keeping track of the results in a list,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which is initially the empty list.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm keeping track of the max value.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Initially we don't have any.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Now, the key function, I'm either going to use the key function

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
you provided me, or if you didn't,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm going to use the function that just maps

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
an argument to itself, and that's for this notation here.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Lambda x maps to x means

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the function that maps the function to itself.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And then I'm going to go through the iterable.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
For each x, I come up with an x value, which I get

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
by applying the key, and if the x value

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
is greater than the max value so far,

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
or if I don't have a result yet at all,

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and that would be the case if I'm at the first element of the iterable,

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
then I want to create the result to be

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
this list of the single item x,

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the value of the first one that I've looked at,

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and I want to set the max value to be equal to that x value.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If it's a tie, then I just want to append x onto the list of results

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
that I've been building up all along.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And then at the end, I want to return the result.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now, of course, I should write tests for this as well

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
just as I always did, and now that I have allmax

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and I have my new version of poker,

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I've also got to write a new documentation string here.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I've written a new documentation string for poker

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
to say that it's returning a list of the winning hands

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
rather than a single winning hand.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I have the definition terms of allmax.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I should write more tests for allmax.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I should go back and change the tests for poker

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
so that instead of returning a single hand,

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
they return a list of the single hand for the tests I have so far.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And then I should also add some more tests where there are some ties

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and make sure that it handles that properly.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Once I've done that, it looks like I'm done.
