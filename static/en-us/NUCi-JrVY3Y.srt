00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,130
If it takes 42 feet of screening to enclose a sunroom at a house, and if the

00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,505
area of that room is 108 square feet, what are the dimensions of that room?

00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:18,220
Enter the length in feet here, and the width in feet here.
