00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,114
As we briefly showed before, when finding the probability of rolling an average

2
00:00:05,114 --> 00:00:09,650
of at least three with the tetrahedral die, the central limit theorem is not

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,402
only awesome, but important, because it allows us to know where any sample mean

4
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:19,842
falls on the distribution of sample means. In the example of the tetrahedral

5
00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:25,482
die, we wanted to know the probability of getting at least a three, for an

6
00:00:25,482 --> 00:00:31,037
average, if we rolled it twice. And we found that when we looked at the

7
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:36,400
histogram, rolling at least a 3 was 6 out of 16. And now, we're extending this

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,290
concept to populations. So, if we have the distribution of sample means where

9
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:47,580
the samples can be any size. Where does a particular sample mean of that same

10
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,948
size fall on the distribution? If we know where it falls on the distribution,

11
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:58,140
then we can decide if this sample is typical or if something weird is going on.

12
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,633
So, let's use another example.
