1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,100
So to give you, again,
still a little bit of intuition, but

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,050
getting a little more formal, so here we
have the same person walking at Time t,

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,719
and then there's a question of
what do we do at Time t plus 1.

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,720
The idea is that from Time t,
we have some prediction or

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,035
some belief that's indicated here in
red of where we think the person is.

6
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:22,630
Okay, and that's our prior.

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,140
So, before we take any measurements
at Time t plus 1, this is our belief.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,620
By the way, I will go back and forth,
the slides sometimes go back and

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,760
forth, between whether we're talking
about moving between t minus 1 and

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,350
t, or t and t plus 1.

11
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,670
It doesn't matter.

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,040
It's just going from one step to the
next and sometimes I screw up one way,

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,240
sometimes I screw up another way.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,940
This is like the story of my life.

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,150
All right, so at red, we have the idea
is we have some prediction to Time t and

16
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,090
we want to know what's
happening at t plus 1.

17
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,180
At Time t plus 1, we take a measurement.

18
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,240
That's what's shown here in green.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,720
Okay, so we had some distribution that
was our belief about what's there and

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,180
now we have some measurement.

21
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,758
Now notice, that this measurement
is also a distribution.

22
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:11,390
We're going to talk in a little
bit about what that means

23
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,700
it means two different things.

24
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,330
One, you can think of is that,
given that the person is someplace,

25
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,070
how likely would be the current
measurement that I got?

26
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,060
So you see here, let's assume
the measurement was there, okay?

27
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:30,050
This distribution says, not how likely
is the person at a particular place,

28
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,180
that's what I'm trying to estimate.

29
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,670
What this distribution says is,

30
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,110
how likely would this measurement be,
how likely would I be to get

31
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,420
this measurement if the person
was at these different locations?

32
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,510
That's a little confusing.

33
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,270
When we do the math of likelihood,
that'll become clearer.

34
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,210
For now, you can think of a measurement
that's just a little bit noisy,

35
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,230
I don't know, you know, it gives me some
bounds on where the person probably is.

36
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,420
And then finally taking that prior be,
belief or

37
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,060
prediction and the measurement,

38
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,040
I come with what's referred to as either
a corrected prediction final estimate.

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,310
Or the technical term is the posterior
distribution is to where I think it is,

40
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,410
and that's what's shown in blue.

41
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,880
So I go from a prior, or an old belief,
to a measurement, to a new belief
