00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,319
Well, as we expected from our picture and from our work earlier on in the

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,148
lesson, we got complex numbers as our roots. Now, looking at where the vertex of

3
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:13,621
our parabola is below the x-axis, and the fact that the parabola is pointing

4
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:18,593
downward, this curve doesn't really fit the situation that we're interested in.

5
00:00:18,593 --> 00:00:22,799
Remember, that y here in this equation and in this graph, is the vertical

6
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:27,419
displacement from the ground of the water and x is the horizontal displacement

7
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:31,502
of the water. Right now, the water is underground and that's not really what

8
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:35,654
Grant's looking for in terms of decorations. So, what do you think is wrong with

9
00:00:35,654 --> 00:00:39,776
Grant's equation and his graph right now? There's one single thing that we can

10
00:00:39,776 --> 00:00:43,770
do to this graph that would fix the entire problem that we're having. The

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,192
mislocation of the horizontal and veritcal coordinates of the water in Grant's

12
00:00:48,192 --> 00:00:52,128
fountain. So, what one step should we do to this graph to make it better

13
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:56,810
describe that fountain's shape? Should we flip this parabola upside down? Should

14
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,876
we translate it up? Translate it down? Make it wider? Make it skinnier?

15
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:05,054
Translate it to the right? Translate it to the left? Or just leave it alone

16
00:01:05,054 --> 00:01:05,809
altogether?
