If we want to play a video game or design a new tennis shoe, or try out

2
00:00:03,228 --> 00:00:07,047
different color paints on a building, we would ideally like the experience to be

3
00:00:07,047 --> 00:00:10,377
interactive. When we take an action we would like to see response from the

4
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:14,472
computer quickly enough that we don't feel slowed down. How fast is fast enough?

5
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:18,681
I'll give you a real number. It's about six frames per second. Let me show you.

6
00:00:18,681 --> 00:00:23,165
So in this demo we're showing six frames per second for this frame right here.

7
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:27,335
And I can adjust that and make it look slower. So, now it's just going to update

8
00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:31,230
at one frame per second and you can see that that's, that's pretty unusable.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,154
It's sort of like you're trying to walk through molasses or something. And

10
00:00:34,154 --> 00:00:38,561
you'll see up in the upper left hand corner how long each frame is taking. So if

11
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:42,684
I adjust it to say, somewhere around 19 or so. Now it's pretty good, you can

12
00:00:42,684 --> 00:00:47,576
still see some jerkiness. But if I go to sixty, it becomes nice and smooth. So

13
00:00:47,576 --> 00:00:48,853
now try it for yourself.
