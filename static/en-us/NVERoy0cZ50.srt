1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,670
You got this.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:08,713
You got this.

3
00:00:08,713 --> 00:00:09,711
>> Eden?

4
00:00:09,711 --> 00:00:10,514
>> Hello.

5
00:00:10,514 --> 00:00:14,190
>> Hi, I'm good welcome
let's head out this way.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,840
So today what's going to
happen is we're going to meet.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,912
>> Hey.

8
00:00:17,912 --> 00:00:20,330
Our IOS candidate is going
to be here pretty soon.

9
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,480
Her portfolio looks really promising.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,960
>> Yeah, I'm just looking at her resume
now and that Mong app that she built.

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,630
That's really intuitive.

12
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,870
So, I'm thinking we tackle it like this.

13
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,275
I'll take the behavioral questions.

14
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:33,230
We'll have Kristen do
the Swift questions, and

15
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,000
then if you could handle
Objective C that would be awesome.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,190
>> Great, yeah, that aught to give
us a good sense of her skills.

17
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,690
It's kind of funny I was looking
at her LinkedIn profile and

18
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,010
I didn't see anything about Objective C.

19
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,105
I guess we'll find out.

20
00:00:47,105 --> 00:00:49,400
Okay, here we are.

21
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,180
Now, do you need anything to drink.

22
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,860
Would you like some tea, some coffee?

23
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,072
>> I'm great, thank you.

24
00:00:54,072 --> 00:00:56,230
>> Okay, let me know if you
have any other questions.

25
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:02,474
>> Thanks a lot.

26
00:01:02,474 --> 00:01:04,075
You got this.

27
00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:05,700
You got this.

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,590
As long as they don't
ask about Objective C.

29
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,620
No, you wouldn't do that.
