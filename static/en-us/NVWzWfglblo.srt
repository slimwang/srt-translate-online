00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,840
Scientists like to talk about
the algorithms they build

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,430
in terms of the problems that they
solve, so this mini course is about

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,260
machine learning and let's think about
the problem the machine learning solves.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,280
In most cases,

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,710
machine learning algorithms
are focused on building a model.

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,080
What's a model?

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,470
A model is something that takes
in observations like this x here,

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,170
run it through some sort of process,
and provide a y.

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,600
So this y is typically a prediction, and

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,900
the x is some sort of
observation of the world.

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,650
Examples might be, for us,

12
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:42,400
x are some features of stocks and
y is a future price.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,760
There are many other uses
of machine learning models.

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,160
That's just one of them.

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,230
X can be multidimensional.

16
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,570
In other words, there might be multiple
factors that we're considering,

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,260
might be Bollinger Bands,
PE ratio, and so on.

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,610
Y is typically single dimension and

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,860
just represents that single-dimension
prediction that we're trying to make.

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,680
Now, there are lots of models
that people have built

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,610
that don't use machine learning at all.

22
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,710
One example is the Black-Scholes
model that predicts option prices.

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,810
There are many other types of models
that predict things that people

24
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,610
build not using machine learning, but
they develop mathematical formulas.

25
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,210
But, of course, with machine learning,
we're trying to use data.

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,490
So the machine learning process
is to take historical data, run

27
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,128
it through a machine learning algorithm
of some sort to generate the model.

28
00:01:40,128 --> 00:01:44,570
Then at runtime or
when we need to use the model,

29
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,550
we push x's in it and y's come out.
