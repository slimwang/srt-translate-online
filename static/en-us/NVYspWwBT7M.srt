00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,580
We keep using this word responsiveness, but what are we actually talking about?

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,541
People use many different devices to access the Internet.

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:11,628
Everything from large desktops, to laptops, netbooks, or

4
00:00:11,628 --> 00:00:13,900
maybe even tablets or phones.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,320
In fact, more and more people every year are accessing the Internet

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,000
primarily through their phones or through their tablets.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,690
In fact right now, there's a pretty good chance that you're watching this

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,670
video on your phone or tablet.

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,770
And every one of these devices uses a different size screen to show you

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,940
the same content.

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,000
But what do we mean by different size?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,320
Of course, we're not talking about the physical size of the screen,

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,310
the height and width of it.

14
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,000
We're talking about its resolution.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,890
Specifically, we want to talk about the resolution of the screen in pixels.

16
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,233
Today, we commonly see desktop screens with widths of say, 1,440 pixels or

17
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:49,314
1,920 pixels.

18
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:54,020
Some large screens today are even going as large as 2,560 pixels wide.

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,860
But not too long ago,

20
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,990
people were using screens that were only 1024 pixels wide or 1200 pixels wide.

21
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,490
For screens like these, it was common to set max widths of

22
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:08,820
960 pixels meaning that web sites were only 960 pixels wide.

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,020
The reason it wasn't the full 1024 or

24
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,890
1200 was to actually leave room on the side of the screen for scroll bars.

25
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,166
To this day creating content with the width of 960 pixels is

26
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,740
still pretty common.

27
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,770
On larger screens of 1920 pixels or 1440 pixels, you can

28
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,720
simply center the 960 pixels wide content to make sure it still looks good.

29
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,650
This max-width CSS style allows us to

30
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,840
insure that our content won't be any bigger than 960 pixels or

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,690
whatever value we choose regardless of the size screen that we're using.

32
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,400
Following the principles of responsive design means that

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,450
your website isn't fixed with single size.

34
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,560
It doesn't matter the type of device.

35
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,210
The page is going to respond and

36
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,050
resize correctly to make sure everything looks great and is legible.

37
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,280
It's also important to note that for devices like tablets and

38
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,200
phones users are using their thumbs, not a mouse, to manipulate the page.

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,220
Which means that you may need to change your layout a bit further to make it

40
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,590
easier to use.

41
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,660
This is called adaptive design.

42
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,220
For now though, we're simply going to focus on responsiveness,

43
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,820
which means simply changing the size of the page to fit.

44
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,570
Let's use the Reddit homepage to see an example of responsive design.

45
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,910
Pay attention to his left column containing all of the posts on the homepage.

46
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,660
I'll resize the screen and we can see that the posts on

47
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,220
the left side got smaller as we made the browser window smaller.

48
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,950
These posts are responsive.

49
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,700
They're changing their width based on the width of the browser.

50
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,940
And note that the column on the right wasn't responsive.

51
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,310
The width here is the same as the width when the browser is full screen.
