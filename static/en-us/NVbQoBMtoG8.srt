If you made it this far in the course, congratulations, you should really be

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,068
proud of all your hard work. You've encountered so much algebra, and my hope is

3
00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:10,940
that you've learned a lot along the way. We have just two more units left, and

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,730
I hope you'll stay with us to complete the course. In this unit we'll learn

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,960
about the Pythagorean theorem and it's applications. Then we'll move on to see

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,442
the different ways that we can slice a cone. Now these cones will produce some

7
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:28,705
intereting patterns. And I can't wait for you to see them. For now let's look

8
00:00:28,705 --> 00:00:31,330
closely at a special right triangle.
