1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,170
So, when we saved a new profile and look
in the data store, we see fields for

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,050
Display Name, and
Tee Shirt Size, and Main Email.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,040
We don't see any User ID field.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,430
That's because we used the User ID to
create the key for the entity, but

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,980
it's not stored as a separate property.
