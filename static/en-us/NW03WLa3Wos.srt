Hi, I'm Peter Chapman, and welcome to the first Office Hours

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
for CS 262 Building a Web Browser.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm your assistant instructor, and I'm filling in for Professor Westley Weimer,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
who's currently at a conference.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My name's Andy.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm the assistant instructor for CS 212,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which is Peter Norvig's class on the design of computer programs.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And I'm going to be filling in the role of the student today

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and asking Peter here

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
all of the questions that you came up with in the forums.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So let's start off.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The first question we had, Peter, was why are we learning regular expressions at all?

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Why is this useful for a class on programming languages?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The class is structured around building a web browser,

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and our web browser needs to interpret html.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The first step to do that is to identify the parts of html.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We want to identify which part is the beginning of a tag,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
the end of a tag, what's a hyperlink, what's just text and words and whatnot.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We want to do that very concisely

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
with the powerful tool that is regular expressions.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Regular expression just allows you to write some text,

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and it very precisely and easily identifies

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
strings that can match, say, our tags or hyperlinks.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay, and I've seen the beginning of Unit 2,

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and it seems like that gets reintroduced then.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Yeah, we use it a lot throughout the course.
