00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,794
We saw earlier, that if we multiply a complex number by its conjugate, the

2
00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:07,605
middle terms cancel out and so we end up with a real number. This is exactly

3
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:11,570
what we're looking for in this situation, to make our denominator what we want

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,832
it to be. Since we don't want to change the value of this fraction that we had

5
00:00:15,832 --> 00:00:20,218
initially, we need to multiply by 1 in the form of the conjugate over itself.

6
00:00:20,218 --> 00:00:24,616
Now, we just need to multiply the numerators of these fractions and their

7
00:00:24,616 --> 00:00:29,386
denominators. At first start of multiplying out, gives us a fraction that I

8
00:00:29,386 --> 00:00:33,562
think is pretty clear we can reduce a little bit more. So, let's keep

9
00:00:33,562 --> 00:00:38,782
simplifying. Our final answer is negative 7 plus 22i all over 13. I think this

10
00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:43,912
definitely looks a lot more manageable than what we started out with. Awesome

11
00:00:43,912 --> 00:00:44,232
job.
