1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,795
I'm here with Dr Markie Blumer, who used to be my professor for Human Sexuality

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:08,164
when I was in my undergraduate. And, I was also her teaching assistant for a

3
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:11,966
semester. Can you tell us a little bit about your background? I am a licenced

4
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:16,250
marriage and family therapist, I am also a licenced mental health counselor.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,667
I'm, I'm an approved supervisor with the American Association for Marriage and

6
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:24,596
Family Therapy. I began teaching about human sexuality in 1998 as an assistant

7
00:00:24,596 --> 00:00:29,611
at the Northern Arizona University. Starting in the fall 2013, I will be an

8
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:34,070
associate professor at the University of Wisconsin at the stout location. And

9
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,334
that'll be in the human development family studies program and marriage and

10
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:41,190
family therapy program. For the last four years, I've been an assistant

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,971
professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. And my PhD is in human

12
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:48,388
development and family studies with an emphasis in marriage and family therapy

13
00:00:48,388 --> 00:00:50,692
from Iowa State University.

14
00:00:50,692 --> 00:00:55,642
>> So what are the stages of the human sexual response? Yeah, great question,

15
00:00:55,642 --> 00:01:00,382
actually that depends on who stages we're talking about. So Helen Singer Kaplan

16
00:01:00,382 --> 00:01:05,767
came up with a three phase cycle of the human sexual response. Which included

17
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:10,974
the desire phase, an arousal phase and then ended with an orgasm phase. Masters

18
00:01:10,974 --> 00:01:14,855
and Johnsons came up with a four stage model. So a little bit different than

19
00:01:14,855 --> 00:01:18,987
Kaplan's model. And their four stage model included an excitement phase, a

20
00:01:18,987 --> 00:01:24,164
plateau phase, an orgasm phase and a resolution phase. So really the biggest

21
00:01:24,164 --> 00:01:27,876
difference was the resolution phase. In other words, they though that there

22
00:01:27,876 --> 00:01:30,660
were something that happened after people reach a plateau or a peek of

23
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,030
excitement through orgasm. And that was kind of this refractory period that

24
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,212
people go through. Where their bodies go back to more of a normative state

25
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:43,468
before arousal occurred. Both of these models are great from a western point of

26
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:48,116
view. there's, there's nothing wrong with these models. They, they match human

27
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:53,080
physiology in a pretty normative way. What's problematic about them however is

28
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,436
not everybody Is situated to understand sexuality and sexual response cycles

29
00:01:57,436 --> 00:02:02,754
from a western point of view. In eastern cultures, there are kind of different

30
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:06,210
ways of conceptualizing sexuality which would be through more like tantric

31
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,865
practices. Which doesn't really have this rigid here are the phases of sexual

32
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:16,064
response cycle that you must complete in order for it to be successful. So,

33
00:02:16,064 --> 00:02:19,950
really those practices are more like, you might be aroused and then you might

34
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:25,023
kind of take a break and then you might become aroused again. and then you

35
00:02:25,023 --> 00:02:29,018
might engage in sexual activity with each other. But rather than having an

36
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:32,129
orgasm, be say the goal for one person, it might just be a goal for one of the

37
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:36,650
other people involved. One person might just might take their time and the

38
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,650
other person might be orgasming multiple times. And maybe one partner never

39
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,658
orgasms and, and that would be considered a great sexual encounter. So really

40
00:02:44,658 --> 00:02:48,088
it just depends on where you are on the globe. Like I said here in Western

41
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:51,100
Culture we have kind of these two ways of thinking about sex.
