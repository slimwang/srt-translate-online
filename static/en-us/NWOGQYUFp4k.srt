1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We now come to the hypothesis test unit number 2 and we just put together

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
what we've learned in the previous hypothesis test unit and in the unit on confidence intervals.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This ends up to be the dominant way of doing hypothesis testing.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We arrive at a very simple formula that we can even program.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
According to Wikipedia in the 2007-2008 season,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the average NBA basketball player was 6 feet and 6.98 inches tall.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That is the same as 200.66 cm or for the sake of this exercise, just 200 cm.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let me question this and see if this is actually acceptable.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Go to a training game for NBA players.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Here they are training, and I drag all of the players in the side and I take their height.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
As I take those measurements, I find, here the sizes I've observed.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In fact, I got everything from 199 cm to 206 in 1 cm increment.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And now, I want to ask the two-sided hypothesis test question

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
whether I shall reject the claim that the average player

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
in the NBA is 200 cm at a 95% confidence level. The trick goes as follows.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You learned about confidence intervals, which is the mean plus/minus a factor taken from the T-table

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
times a square root of the empirical variance over N.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That formula you've not seen many times in practice.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:44,000
When I plug this in here with the appropriate (a), I get for the mean 202.5 Â± 1.916.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
If you want to check this, I'm using 2.365 for (a).

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Graphically, what this means is if here is the 200 and here are my data points,

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the mean measurement of the sample sits over here and the 95% confidence level stops at 200.58,

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
just short of 200, and that means we reject the hypothesis of 200 cm

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
based on our sample of 8 people, because the confidence interval doesn't quite make it here.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Now, I should argue that this isn't quite correct in practice depending on what town I go to,

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I might find a different sample and a different town.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We say we didn't pick these people completely independently and it isn't accounted here.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's just a word of caution, but I think you get the principle. It's really simple.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Use your confidence interval and check whether the outcome

30
00:02:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
lies within or outside the confidence interval.
