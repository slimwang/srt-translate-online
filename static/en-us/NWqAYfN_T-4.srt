00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,510
Wonderful.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,120
One of the first things
you'll note about my answers

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,440
is that two of them have
a range of accepted values.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,780
That's because you can build
a prototype which does or

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,570
does not contain certain screens.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,960
For the home screen we certainly
have the fav and the menu button.

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,810
But we may also have
an interaction point for any or

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,100
all of the events themselves.

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,030
That means we have a range of two to
five interaction points for this screen.

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,200
For the menu screen, we have six
interaction points on the main menu.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,290
But could also have a settings screen,
terms and conditions screen,

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,490
logout screen or a profile screen
accessed by the picture or name up here.

13
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,930
That means a range of six
to ten interaction points.

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,890
The new events screen is
the only straightforward one.

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,240
You can leave this screen either by
going back to the home screen or

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,010
by clicking Create.

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,070
That means there are exactly
two interaction points here.
