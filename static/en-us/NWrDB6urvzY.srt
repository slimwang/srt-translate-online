1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,719
Let's take a closer look at
this version of Color Maker.

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:04,768
We go in here to the red switch.

3
00:00:04,768 --> 00:00:10,980
Oh, yikes, this looks like
a pretty serious problem.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,664
Fatal, fatal error.

5
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:18,125
Unexpectedly found nil while
unwrapping an Optional value.

6
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:22,484
Okay, so something's nil, and
the compiler is pointing us

7
00:00:22,484 --> 00:00:27,109
straight to this line where our
colorview is getting accessed.

8
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:29,930
So, the first place to look
might be the colorView.

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,959
So, let's go up to where our
colorView property is set, and

10
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:36,432
oop, the outlet is not set.

11
00:00:36,432 --> 00:00:39,812
So, to fix that outlet, we're going to
want to go back into Storyboard,

12
00:00:41,182 --> 00:00:44,642
then we're going to open up the pop
up menu for the colorView, and

13
00:00:44,642 --> 00:00:47,362
drag from New Referencing Outlet
to the view controller.

14
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,892
Let's run it again, and
see if that took care of the problem.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,090
Red switch seems to work.

16
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,748
Green looks okay.

17
00:00:56,748 --> 00:00:57,488
Blue.

18
00:00:57,488 --> 00:00:59,940
All right, back in business.
