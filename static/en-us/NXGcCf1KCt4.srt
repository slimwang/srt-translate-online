1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,030
All right, so
to empty this main content area,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,490
we want to empty this div
with the class of main.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,725
Looking at the d3 documentation,

4
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:11,843
I can see that there's a couple
functions that might work.

5
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:15,004
.text, get or set text content.

6
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:17,738
Well, we don't actually
want to change text,

7
00:00:17,738 --> 00:00:21,040
we want to change
the HTML that's inside.

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,850
So, selection.html seems
like a better choice.

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,740
Get or set inner HTML content.

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,265
Reading a little bit closely
about the HTML method,

11
00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:34,900
we can see that it allows us to get and
set the inner HTML.

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,240
If a value is specified as the parameter
then it sets the inner HTML content

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,200
to the specified value on
all the selected elements.

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,900
And a little bit further down,

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,140
we can clear the content
by passing in a null value.

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,209
Let's see if that works.

17
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,370
If you chain the .html onto a selection,

18
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,850
then you can see the current inner
HTML content for that selection.

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,460
That's everything that's
inside of our main div tag.

20
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,750
We want to clear this out, so
let's pass in a null value.

21
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,390
By passing in the JavaScript
keyword null,

22
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,900
we can reset the main content area.

23
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,620
And any undefined value or
no value would have worked.

24
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,790
So, I could have also
passed in undefined here.

25
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,360
And finally,

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,250
the last method that would have
worked is passing in an empty string.
