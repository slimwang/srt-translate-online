1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,460
Let's take a closer look at
the major elements of a script.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,040
Pop open the Unity Editor,
and create a new project.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,430
Now, create a new C# script,
called MyFirstBehaviour.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,900
You'll notice that I;m
spelling behavior with a u.

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,210
That's because even though I'm in the
US, Unity originally comes from Denmark.

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,640
All of their names use
European English spelling.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,570
So, for consistency,
we'll adopt that style as well.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,130
Speaking of behaviors,

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,560
you might be wondering why these scripts
are called Behaviors in the first place.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,070
In Unity, you write scripts
that describe behaviors

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,400
that get attached to an object.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,640
For example,
a dog might have a bark behavior.

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,010
A walk around behavior.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,690
And a love humans behavior.

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,170
This makes it much easier for
you to organize and reuse your scripts.

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,890
So remember, scripts describe behaviors
that get attached to game objects.

17
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,449
Okay, double-click and
open up your new script.

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,310
Let's take a look at
the part labeled Start.

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,660
What you see here is called a method.

20
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,210
You use that to give a name
to a part of your script so

21
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,370
that you can more easily find and
execute that part.

22
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,260
For instance,

23
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,130
remember that the start method happens
when the script is first loaded.

24
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,810
An update happens every Friday.

25
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,290
But, what are methods anyways?

26
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,020
Programming is a lot like writing
instructions for a recipe.

27
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,600
Think of methods as the major verbs for
your instructions.

28
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,940
In this example, the start method
contains all the instructions you need

29
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,230
to happen when you first load the scene.

30
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,840
The update method contains
all the instructions for

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,222
when this behavior actually happens.

32
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:50,320
All right, now you know
the major elements of a script.
