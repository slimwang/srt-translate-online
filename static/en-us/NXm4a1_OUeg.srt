1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,630
Next, hit time is affected

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,320
by having to access the TLB
before we access the cache.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,000
Remember that the processor starts
out with the virtual address.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,400
We use some part of that virtual
address to index into the TLB and

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,490
find the frame number.

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:24,790
We then combine that with the page
offset and now that we have the physical

7
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,460
address, we can use it to access
our cache and get the data from it.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,110
So really,
if the TLB takes one cycle and

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,330
the cache takes one cycle, we need two
cycles from when the processor gives us

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,810
the address until we
actually get the data.

11
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,120
Because really the TLB access and

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,450
the cache access have to
happen one after the other.

13
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:50,280
A cache that is accessed using a
physical address is called a physically

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,160
accessed cache, a physical cache, and
also it is called physically indexed or

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,590
physically tagged or PIPT cache.

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,090
The overall hit latency of that cache
really is the TLB hit latency and

17
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,840
the cache hit latency.
