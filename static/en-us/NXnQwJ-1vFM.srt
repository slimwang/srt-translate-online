1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,220
To review this, let's take a quiz.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,150
If two processes, P1 and P2, are running at the same time,

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,530
what are the ranges of their virtual address space that they will have?

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,708
The first choice is P1 has address ranges from 0 to 32,000, and

5
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:22,300
P2 from 32,001 until 64,000.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,530
The second choice is that both P1 and P2 have address ranges from 0 to 64,000.

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:34,143
And the last choice, P1 has an address space range from 32,001 to 64,000,

8
00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:38,039
and P2 has address ranges from 0 to 32,000.

9
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,007
So the reverse from the first one.

10
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:43,590
So go ahead and mark all the ones that you think are correct answers.
