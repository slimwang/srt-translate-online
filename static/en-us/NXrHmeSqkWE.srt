00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,840
At the beginning of the lesson we
identified NP as those problems for

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,020
which an answer can be
verified in polynomial time.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,530
Remember how easy it was to check
that a clique was a clique?

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,370
In the more formal treatment however,
we identified NP as those languages

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,650
recognized by non-deterministic
Turing machines in polynomial time.

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,210
Now we get to see why
these mean the same thing.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,300
To get some intuition,

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,210
we'll revisit the example of
finding a clique of size four.

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,010
We already discussed how a clique
of size four is easy to verify.

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,860
But how easy is it to find with
a non-deterministic machine?

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,800
The key is to use the non-determinism
to create a branch of computation for

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,040
each subset of size four.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,710
And then use our verification strategy

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,920
to decide whether any of those
subsets correspond to a clique.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,160
Remember, that if any sequence
of configuration accepts,

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,790
then the non-deterministic
machine accepts.

17
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,420
One branch of computation
might choose these four, and

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,970
then reject, because it's not a clique.

19
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,630
Another branch of computation might
choose these four, and also reject.

20
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,750
But one branch will choose the correct
subset, and this will accept.

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,440
And that's all we need.

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,850
If one branch accepts,

23
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,490
then the whole non-deterministic
machine does as it should.

24
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,040
There is this clique of size four here.
