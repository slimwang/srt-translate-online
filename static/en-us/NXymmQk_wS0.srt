00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:04,074
Let's look at the inverse of multiplication, division. What if we want to

2
00:00:04,074 --> 00:00:08,556
represent the log of a quotient? We know that division is just repeated

3
00:00:08,556 --> 00:00:12,772
subtraction, so using that knowledge, how do you think we might represent

4
00:00:12,772 --> 00:00:18,626
natural log of 3 over 7? Remember, ln is just the same as log base e, so in

5
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:23,214
this slot, please make a prediction of how you would rewrite ln of 3 over 7 in

6
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:29,440
terms of natural logs. Think back to the product property, and how this might

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,732
be different for division instead of multiplication.
