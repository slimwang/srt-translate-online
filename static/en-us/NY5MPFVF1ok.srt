1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,083
So here's what I want all of you to do.

2
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:05,625
First, I want you to try to
make a Photosynth for yourself.

3
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:08,539
The best way to do of course is
go to the Photosynth site and

4
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:12,248
actually create a account for yourself
and then upload some pictures and

5
00:00:12,248 --> 00:00:15,250
then use that to kind of
showcase a variety of things.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,033
And of course, if, just,
this is one of those things,

7
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:21,471
completion is just entering your
a Photosynth ID in this box here

8
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:23,333
to showcase that you've done this.

9
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,833
Again, make sure that there's
no private stuff on this thing.

10
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,237
You don't have to make
all of this public.

11
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:31,542
Just, this is just for us to know that
you've actually accomplished this goal.

12
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:35,429
You will actually be doing a complete
assignment on Photosynth as one of

13
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:37,125
the assignments in the class.

14
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,214
So here, we are at the site.

15
00:00:39,214 --> 00:00:42,042
You can sign in by creating
an account for yourself.

16
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,500
I'm going to sign in as
myself very quickly.

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,310
So when you are on this site, you can
basically kind of walk around and

18
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,333
see a variety of things.

19
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,917
There's a whole lot of detail about.

20
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:54,559
It will tell you how to also do
different types of synths and

21
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,708
explore different types of things.

22
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:59,292
Of course, these are a variety of
things other people have been doing.

23
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:03,756
In addition to that, of course, you can
also go and create your own synths and

24
00:01:03,756 --> 00:01:06,750
there are a variety of ways
of doing this kind of stuff.

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,708
I recommend that you play
around with that technology.

26
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:12,426
They just announced
a newer version of this,

27
00:01:12,426 --> 00:01:16,858
which basically also lets you do this
kind of synth in 3D and the best way to

28
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:21,167
create it is basically going in here and
uploading a bunch of pictures.

29
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:25,894
Again, there is a lot of help on how
you can actually learn how to do this.

30
00:01:25,894 --> 00:01:30,942
This new version allows you to do four
types of different synths spinning

31
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:36,805
camera, walking Circulating around to
create a panorama also walking this way.

32
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,168
Again, there's a lot of details.

33
00:01:38,168 --> 00:01:42,311
And of course, there are also apps
available on an Android, iOS and

34
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,958
windows platform for
you allowing to do this kind of stuff.

35
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:49,663
So please create an account, try to
upload an image or two, but you'll need,

36
00:01:49,663 --> 00:01:52,208
of course, more than two to
create any kind of synth.

37
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,500
Load a variety of images.

38
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,967
For those of you who have what,

39
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:58,623
Windows Workstations,you can actually
do much more with Photosynth.

40
00:01:58,623 --> 00:02:00,628
And of course,
you can just use the browser for

41
00:02:00,628 --> 00:02:02,125
what I do these kinds of things to.

42
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:05,821
So please explore and
return to this site when you're done and

43
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:07,750
enter your Photosynth ID.
