1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,195
The number of dimes to the number of quarters is 2 to 3. So, if I reverse that

2
00:00:04,207 --> 00:00:08,601
ratio, the number of quarters to the number of dimes must be 3 to 2. I can write

3
00:00:08,613 --> 00:00:12,771
that with words, with a colon, or as a fraction. The second one was really

4
00:00:12,783 --> 00:00:17,226
tricky. I don't know the total number of dimes and I don't know the total number

5
00:00:17,238 --> 00:00:21,497
of coins So, what can I do? Well, let's try some cases. If I started out with

6
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:26,068
two dimes, I'd have to have 3 quarters, which would be 5 coins in total. But I

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,648
didn't necessarily have to start with 2 dimes. What if I started with 4 dimes? I

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,672
doubled the number of dimes that I started with. So, I also need to double my

9
00:00:34,684 --> 00:00:39,491
number of quarters. So, 4 dimes would have 6 quarters, which would be 10 coins

10
00:00:39,503 --> 00:00:43,959
in total. Notice that 2 divides into 4 and 10. 2 is the common factor, so I can

11
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:48,441
simplify this fraction. And even if I had 6 dimes, I would have to have 9

12
00:00:48,453 --> 00:00:52,782
quarters, or 15 coins in total. And this fraction still reduces to 2 5ths. I

13
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:57,675
removed a 3 as the common factor. That's pretty incredible. I didn't even know

14
00:00:57,687 --> 00:01:02,093
the total number of coins, or the total number of dimes, but I knew the ratio.

15
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:06,402
It was 2 to 5. If you didn't get the second part of the problem right, that's

16
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:09,128
okay. I just wanted to get you thinking about ratios.
