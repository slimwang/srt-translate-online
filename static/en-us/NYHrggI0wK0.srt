00:00:00,322 --> 00:00:03,710
Ubuntu comes with a firewall
pre-installed called ufw, but

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,550
it's not currently active.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,820
You can verify this by typing command,
sudo ufw status.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,240
Status: inactive.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,370
Let's start adding some
rules to our firewall,

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,570
then we'll actually turn it on.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,970
If we think back to the wall
of boxes from our last video,

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,280
we were initially blocking
all incoming requests.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,070
This is a good practice, as it makes
it much easier to manage your rules.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,950
Just block everything coming in,
then only allow what you need.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,270
We'll establish this default,
deny incoming, by using this rule.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,020
We can also establish a default rule for
our outgoing connections,

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,790
any request our server is trying
to send out to the internet.

14
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,940
We'll set this rule by using this
command, sudo ufw the default rule,

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,300
allow all outgoing.

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,970
Go ahead and check the status of your
firewall by typing, sudo ufw status.

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,670
You'll see that it's currently still
inactive, which is a good thing.

18
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,770
We're just configuring our firewall now.

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,650
We actually have to turn it on ourselves
once we have everything how we want.

20
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,820
If we were to turn the firewall on now,

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,310
we'd we blocking all incoming
connections including SSH, which means

22
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,200
our server would be dead in the water
and completely inaccessible to us.

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,470
It's now time for us to start
configuring the firewall to support

24
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,570
the various ports and
the applications we know we'll need.
