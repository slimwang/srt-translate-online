00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,330
The idea of a pipeline is that every object is dealt with once. Say, we have a

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,782
list of 52 parts for a car, each part represented by a set of triangles. Each of

3
00:00:08,782 --> 00:00:12,497
these parts is sent down the graphics pipeline and is rendered to the screen.

4
00:00:12,498 --> 00:00:15,990
Once an object goes through this process, we're done with it for the frame. If

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,455
we stop the process half way through and looked at the image formed, we'd see

6
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:23,196
only the first 26 car parts in the image. The advantage of a pipeline is that

7
00:00:23,196 --> 00:00:27,297
each part of the pipeline can be worked on as a separate task at the same time.

8
00:00:27,298 --> 00:00:31,476
Say, we take a trip to the local cardboard box factory. I won't describe what

9
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:35,708
each step is because it's a box factory, that's pretty boring. All you need to

10
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:39,372
know is that each step takes the same amount of time. So let's say each stage

11
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,251
takes 10 seconds. If you want a single box, it'll take 30 seconds from start to

12
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:47,133
finish to make it. However, if you want a lot of boxes, a new box will arrive at

13
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:51,235
the end of the assembly line every 10 seconds. Let's see how that works. The red

14
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:55,646
box gets cut, that's 10 seconds. While red box is at a folding station, the

15
00:00:55,646 --> 00:01:00,308
yellow box follows behind and is now being cut at the same time. Each taking 10

16
00:01:00,308 --> 00:01:05,285
seconds. In the next 10 seconds, the red box is taped, the yellow box is folded,

17
00:01:05,285 --> 00:01:09,520
and the blue box is cut, that's 30 seconds. After this point you can see another

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,920
box will come off the assembly line every 10 seconds.
