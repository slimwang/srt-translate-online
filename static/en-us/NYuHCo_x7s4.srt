1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,400
Ken, we need to film,
what are you doing?

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,130
>> Hold on, hold on, hold on.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,640
>> You buying some tight kicks?

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,230
>> Yeah, and I'm just about done.

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:16,530
I can see that I just need to finish
my payment information and done.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,450
>> Why don't you show
then what you just did?

7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,060
>> Okay, all right, my phone wasn't
actually on because we're acting.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,470
Come on we're filming.

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,960
Anyways.
[LAUGH] I just thought

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,080
this would be a good lead-in to
the feedback part of this lesson,

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,960
because it's all about showing
your users their progress.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,540
>> I see,
you were buying something online and

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,000
the form was nice enough to show you
that you only had to finish paying.

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,960
>> Yeah, but my phone is off, so

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,680
why don't you show students
what this actually looks like?

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,180
>> Sounds good.
