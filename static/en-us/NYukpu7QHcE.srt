00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
As you might have seen in some of the preceding units,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I like to write parody songs about computer science topics.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I provide links to my songs about sorting and the halting problem,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and I also have one about binary numbers that turned out to be pretty popular.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
When I was recording the units of this class,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I decided I wanted to make a new song for this class.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I told my friends at Udacity, and they were very supportive.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In fact, they joined in and helped me make my first collaborative academic parody song.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I wanted to use a currently popular song and use it to touch on the main topics in the class.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It was very fun to make, and I'm so appreciate to my friends at Udacity for making it happen.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I think it came out really well, and I hope you enjoy it.
