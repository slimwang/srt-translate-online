00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,740
the components, and you're kind of pre-assuming what it's going to look like,

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,910
the data format, any change to that is

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,060

00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,460
But whenever you have shared assumptions, if you violate an assumption,
