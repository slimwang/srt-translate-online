1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
With the first one, the units of measurement would be okay for a rate of change of tons per year.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If you look at this first expression, you see that it's not doing what it supposed to be doing.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Actually we are still multiplying the current amount of fish by 0.5 per year

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
but still the same growth rate all of the time.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The second term 0.5 per year times minus 10⁶ tons

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
is just similar to harvesting a huge the amount of harvesting--this cannot be the solution.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The third option doesn't work because the unit of measurement are wrong.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Tons times tons divided by year, tons squared per year. That's not what we want to have.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The second one is the one that works.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The initial rate of change that's 0.5 per year is multiplied by a factor that's 1

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
if the amount of fish is 0--1 minus 0 over something and is multiplied by 0

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
if that amount is 10⁶ tons 1 minus 10⁶ tons/10⁶ tons.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This factor modifies the initial rate of change in the way that we need it

14
00:01:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and here of course, we don't have harvesting.
