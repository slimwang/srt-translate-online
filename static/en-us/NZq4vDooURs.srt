1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,043
So now we have the second step in our universal guide to solving all problems,

2
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:08,214
which is understanding what the outputs are. All we have left to do is the third

3
00:00:08,214 --> 00:00:11,614
step, and this is kind of the hard one. This is to solve the problem. So now,

4
00:00:11,614 --> 00:00:14,806
we're going to talk a lot more about how we actually do this. But, I want to

5
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,658
emphasize that if you don't do the first part, you're going to have a really

6
00:00:17,658 --> 00:00:20,942
hard time solving the problem. So, you always want to start by thinking about

7
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:24,290
the inputs and outputs, and then go on to the hard part of figuring out how do

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,129
you map inputs to the correct outputs.
