1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,730
For the first one, you need to type y, the caret key, the negative symbol and

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,001
then 5. For the second expression, we'll start by entering z, the caret symbol

3
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:14,838
and then 6. Remember this caret will move our cursor bar from the main line up

4
00:00:14,838 --> 00:00:19,222
into the exponent position. We hit the right arrow key to continue back down to

5
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:23,680
the main line, then we type a plus sign, then number 3, and the variable x. To

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,675
get this exponent of 3, we type our carrot symbol and then the number 3. Our

7
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:31,701
cursor bar would be here at this point, so we need to move it back down to the

8
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:36,595
main line, so we hit the right arrow key. And we finish out by typing y, the

9
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:41,160
arrow key, and then the number 3. For the last expression, we start by typing in

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,250
the negative sign and then a forward slash. The forward slash will create two

11
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,870
empty spots for the numerator and the denominator. To get our numerator we

12
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:54,725
simply type 5y, the carat key, and the number 2. At this point a cursor bar will

13
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:58,583
be in the exponent position. We hit the right arrow key once, which will send

14
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:02,284
our cursor bar back down to the main line of the numerator. To move into the

15
00:01:02,284 --> 00:01:06,718
denominator, we hit the right arrow key one more time. Now that our cursor bar

16
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:11,208
is down to the denominator, we type 8 to get our full fraction. Now that we have

17
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:15,548
our fraction, we need to move our cursor bar out of it, we hit the right arrow

18
00:01:15,548 --> 00:01:19,888
key one more time and then we can enter in the plus sign x the caret key and the

19
00:01:19,888 --> 00:01:24,596
number three. This will gove us our second term. Our cursor bar would be here,

20
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:28,195
so we hit the right arrow key to get back to the main line and then we type the

21
00:01:28,195 --> 00:01:32,123
plus sign and 2. This gives us our full expression.
