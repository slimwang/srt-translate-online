1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,800
Here's a data analyst diagram we
will use to help orient ourselves.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,219
This will help us better understand
where we are, and where we'd like to go.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,940
First, let's pretend
we're trying to predict

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,170
which items will sell the most
depending on what the weather is like.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,970
We'll also say we have a lot of data
about the sales patterns of our

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,49
products.

7
00:00:21,50 --> 00:00:23,670
So for this example,
where are we on this chart?

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,460
We know we have a business problem where
we're trying to predict an outcome.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,589
That rules out needing
to do any data analysis.

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,769
What we also know, is we have lots of
data, so we can call it data rich.

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,410
Now we are divided between two sections,
numeric and classification.

12
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,923
We're working with weather, so we need
to decide if that is a numeric or

13
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,392
non-numeric variable.

14
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:54,590
Since we need to categorize
the weather by sun, rain or

15
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,650
anything else, this makes it
a category which is non-numeric.

16
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,890
This puts us on the classification path.

17
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,510
And in this course,

18
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,450
we'll learn what is going on within
this classification section.

19
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,600
To do this, we divided
the lesson into four sections.

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,520
In the first section,

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,60
we're going to learn what this
whole classification thing means.

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,9
We're also going to start
to prepare data for

23
00:01:22,10 --> 00:01:25,480
the various types of models
taught throughout the course.

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,240
In the second section,
we're going to compare binary models

25
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,560
against each other to determine
which model to use for prediction.

26
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,390
We are also going to be building
out this prediction model.

27
00:01:37,615 --> 00:01:41,265
In the third section,
we're going to do exactly the same thing

28
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:46,575
as in the second section, but in the
context of predicting non-binary data.

29
00:01:46,575 --> 00:01:50,845
And finally, we're going to give you
a classification business problem.

30
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:54,804
You will work with some data and let
you loose using the techniques you've

31
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:59,445
learned throughout this course to
present and explain the model you chose.

32
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:01,785
We've got a lot of work to do,
so let's begin!
