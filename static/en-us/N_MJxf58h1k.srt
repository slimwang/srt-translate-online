1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,920
From the list of apps that we just saw,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,570
I want to focus on one in particular,
Facebook.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,710
And I want to use it as an example
of how apps use the network.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,000
Facebook, for
those of you who have not used it,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,290
is an app that allows people to
share social data over the network.

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,380
Users can share thoughts, photos, and

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,240
videos of everything from cute
kittens to current news items.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,470
Each of these features,
uses the Network.

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,300
More specifically,

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,020
each of these features uses
the network to send and receive data.

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,900
Data can be text, images, video,
or any media that's sent and

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,460
received over the network.

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,250
But in order to make use of data, apps
have to be able to send and receive it.

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,600
So, how does this happen?

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,460
One of the most common ways, is by
HTTP or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
