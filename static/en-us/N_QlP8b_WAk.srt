1
00:00:00,387 --> 00:00:02,639
So now life gets ugly.

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,701
I'm going to be using the notation from Forsyth and Ponce.

3
00:00:06,701 --> 00:00:09,616
It, it might not be the best notation, but it is a notation for

4
00:00:09,616 --> 00:00:13,446
dealing with quarter transformations, which is what we're going to be doing.

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:17,935
So the idea here is that superscripts are going to represent what

6
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,191
coordinate frame you're in.

7
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:26,368
So here I have some point P and I've got the A coordinate frame.

8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,945
And the expression of the location of point P

9
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:32,649
in the A coordinate frame can be thought of as a variety of ways.

10
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:35,981
You can think of it as the location x, y, z in the A frame.

11
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:39,511
But if you remember a little but from your, I don't know, algebra, calculus.

12
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:44,244
The right way of thinking about the vector that goes from the origin to P,

13
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:48,915
that's this vector here is, it's got the i component of the amount x.

14
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:54,813
The j component of the amount y, A and this k component of the amount z, A.

15
00:00:54,813 --> 00:00:58,822
So a vector is actually the sum of these three components, the i component,

16
00:00:58,822 --> 00:01:00,338
j component, k component.

17
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:05,318
Each scaled by the coefficients, x and A, y and A, z and A.

18
00:01:05,318 --> 00:01:10,213
Suppose I want to express the location of point P,

19
00:01:10,213 --> 00:01:15,226
whose value I might know in coordinate frame A, but

20
00:01:15,226 --> 00:01:21,074
I'd like to know where it is in terms of coordinate frame B.

21
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:27,274
Well that's just a translation and it's handled very simply by saying,

22
00:01:27,274 --> 00:01:31,674
the location of P in B is just the location of P in A plus

23
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:37,175
the location of the origin A expressed in the B frame, all right?

24
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:42,211
And so that equation just gives us that new offset and this OA in B,

25
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:44,514
that's just a three vector.

26
00:01:44,514 --> 00:01:49,795
That's the offset of the origin of A in the B frame.

27
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:53,637
I told you this was ugly, but, we, you know, we have to slog through it.

28
00:01:53,637 --> 00:01:56,823
The good news is once again, homogeneous transformations or

29
00:01:56,823 --> 00:02:00,452
I should say, homogeneous coordinates are going to come to our rescue.

30
00:02:00,452 --> 00:02:05,177
Where translation can be expressed as a multiplication.

31
00:02:05,177 --> 00:02:10,606
So we've rewritten this top equation P in B is equal to p in a plus OA in B,

32
00:02:10,606 --> 00:02:13,153
as this matrix transformation.

33
00:02:13,153 --> 00:02:15,657
A couple of things, first of all, that i,

34
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:18,169
that's a three by three identity matrix.

35
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:22,058
So this is, and since OA and B is a, is a three by one.

36
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:27,453
This is a four by four matrix, which means that this vector down here, that's

37
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:33,111
actually a zero vector of length three transpose, so it's three zeroes in a row.

38
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:38,149
It's actually 0, 0, 0 and this is 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0.

39
00:02:38,149 --> 00:02:39,310
That's clear, isn't it?

40
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,435
That's why we draw it this way.

41
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:42,315
Okay?

42
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:45,649
And just to remind you, translation is commutative.

43
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:46,450
Okay?

44
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,230
And you can actually show that in the matrix multiplication, if you wanted.
