1
00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:09,532
So what happens here is that we write down four equal factors--one plus X over four times one plus X over four,

2
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:17,799
times one plus X over four, times one plus X over four. And then we look what this is going to turn into.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:26,599
For the first box we need everything that has no X whatsoever. This is just one times one times one times one.

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:36,899
Anything else would have an X in it. So this becomes one. For the next box, we need everything that has precisely one X in it.

5
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:45,832
For instance, X over four times one times one times one. One times X over four times one times one.

6
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:56,166
One times one times X over four times one, and there's a fourth one: One times one times one times X over four.

7
00:00:56,167 --> 00:01:04,866
We get four of these. Four times X over four, which is one times X. Four X squared.

8
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:13,899
We have X from the first two parentheses, but one from parentheses number three and parentheses number four.

9
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:20,632
X from the first, one from the second, X from the third, one from the fourth.

10
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:28,066
Or X from the first, one from the second, one from the third, and X from the fourth.

11
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:39,199
Or one from the first, X from the second, X from the third, one from the fourth, one from the first, X from the second,

12
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:51,199
one from the third, and X from the fourth. And the final one, one from the first, one from the second, X from the third, X from the fourth.

13
00:01:51,200 --> 00:02:00,499
Six options to form something that contains X squared. Six times X over four times X over four.

14
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,599
We can cancel a factor of two, which leaves us with three over eight.

15
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,766
To get X to the third power, we need to pick X from three parentheses, and one from the other.

16
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:20,299
We can pick X from the first three parentheses, and the one from the last, or X from parentheses number one, number two,

17
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:29,332
the one from the third, X from the last, X from the first parentheses, one from the second, X from the third,

18
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:36,899
X from the fourth, and one from the first, X from the second, X from the third, X from the fourth.

19
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:47,699
So, four ways of doing this, four times X over four times X over four, times X over four, which leaves us with X to the third power

20
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:55,099
over 16. One over 16. And the final one: We need four factors of X.

21
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,699
You have to pick this and this and this and this. That's it. Only one option for doing that.

22
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:09,099
Which leaves us with X over four times X over four times X over four times X over four.

23
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:16,199
X to the fourth power divided by 256. One over 256.

24
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:23,799
So this is a crude approximation to the exponential function, and we find a way of expressing this with powers of X.

25
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,332
The beginning of a power series. Let me restate the general equation for the exponential function again.

26
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:38,999
E to the power of X is the limit as N goes to infinity of one plus X over N to the power of N.

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,199
We have now looked at the special case of N equals four. Hopefully, you can imagine that this also works out

28
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:56,299
for 40 or 400, 4,000, four billion, four whichever number. And the result is it's one plus X--

29
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:04,566
We have that already. One plus one X, plus X squared over two. You see we're close.

30
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:10,332
Four over eight would be one half. We've got three over eight, with that four here.

31
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:20,332
Plus X to the third power over six, plus X to the fourth power over 24, plus, and so on, up to infinity.

32
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:26,966
To prove this, you need a better method than we have used here; you need binomial coefficients.

33
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:31,532
But hopefully, you get the idea where this power series comes from.

34
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:41,966
And actually, it turns out that the six is the factorial of three; this 24 is the factorial of four, and so on.

35
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:48,032
So the general term would be X to the power of N divided by N factorial.

36
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:55,632
This also gives us a way of computing E itself. E equals E to the power of one.

37
00:04:55,633 --> 00:05:07,799
So we simply set X to one, which means E equals one plus one plus one over two, plus one over six, plus one over 24,

38
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:14,199
plus, and so on, up to infinity. And now you can see how efficient this power series is.

39
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:26,966
One plus one, so we have two already, plus one half, is 2.5, plus one over six equals 2.6.

40
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:35,099
You see we're getting pretty quickly pretty close to 2.71 something. So if you actually want to computer Euler's number,

41
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,033
or the exponential function, you're using this power series.
