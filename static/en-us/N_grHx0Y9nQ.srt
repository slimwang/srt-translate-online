00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
Even though some of us might think
we need a traffic psychologist

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,740
when we're stuck in traffic for hours
and going crazy, it's not a real subfield.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,270
Neither is canine psychology,
although there are psychologists

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,749
who primarily use animals
in their research.

5
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:18,110
And behavioral psychology has been used
to teach animals how to do amazing things.

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,243
For example, did you know that rats
can detect landmines through smell?

7
00:00:22,243 --> 00:00:25,996
Or that dolphins can locate
underwater mines and protect boats?

8
00:00:25,996 --> 00:00:28,960
Psychologists can learn a lot
from animals through research.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,911
And psychological methods
can be used to teach animals

10
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:33,924
how to help and work with humans.
