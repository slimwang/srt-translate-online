00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go back and take a look at this again.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We now know how deep. It's log n.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And we know how many leaves. It's n.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
At each of these levels, not only is it going to compute the subgraph of the given size,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
but then it's going to add 1 more edge that is the connector between the 2 components.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So there's 1 of those edges gets added at this level.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There's 2 that get added at this level.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There's 4 that get added at this level.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There's 8 that get added at this level.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Until finally, at the end of the day, there's zero that get added at this level.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But the level right above it, there's n.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So the total number of edges that get added is the sum of all these things--

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
n + n/2 + n/4 to 1.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That is basically 2n--so that we don't have to say basically

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
we can say it's exactly Î(n),

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
meaning it's basically 2n.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What we basically rediscovered is that the number of edges in a tree,

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
or one of these randomly generated trees,

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
is still linear.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's not so surprising, but this particular way of doing the analysis with this tree

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
is going to turn out to be useful in some other settings.
