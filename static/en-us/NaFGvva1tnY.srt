1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,980
Well, if you want to know what I think,
and

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,330
I'm sure you don't,
I think the answer is yes.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,670
Intuitively, system B is three
times faster than system A but

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,430
at only the cost of twice the energy.

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,040
So in terms of energy and time you get
more bang for you buck from system B.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,980
Now to really convince you,
let's be a little bit more precise.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,700
First, observe that as given system
b uses six times as much power as a.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,790
So what about DVFS?

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,680
The key relationship that DVFS
enables you to control is

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,290
what is the one in which power
goes like frequency cubed?

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,400
So we can define the power of
systems A and B as follows.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,570
The power of either system A or
B is basically some system dependent

13
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,180
constant, kA or kB,
times frequency cubed.

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,460
Now we rescale B to
match the power of A.

15
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,810
Let's call this new system C
notice that it's the same as B,

16
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,300
except for its frequency.

17
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,790
The frequency of C is what
we're adjusting relative to B

18
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,510
in order to match the power of system A.

19
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,800
Now write down the power
relationships that you know.

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,240
The first one is that
the power of B over A is 6.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,820
Notice that this determines the
relationship between the frequency of B

22
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,670
and the frequency of A.

23
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,640
The second power relationship
is between C and A.

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,620
Which have the same power.

25
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,730
Again, this tells something about the
relationship between their frequencies.

26
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:30,880
Now let's consider the execution time
on system A relative to system C.

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,920
If this ratio is greater than 1 then
system C is faster than system A.

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,730
So let's see if it is.

29
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,120
This ratio can be re-written,

30
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,920
namely the time of A divided by the time
of C is equal to the time of A divided

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,080
by the time of B, times the time
of B divided by the time of C.

32
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,580
The Bs cancel.

33
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,630
Now systems B and C are the same except
for their differing clock frequencies.

34
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,940
This tells us how the ratio of
their execution times will differ.

35
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,940
That's because time is inversely
proportional to frequency

36
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,310
assuming that we can neglect any
other non local compute cost.

37
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,265
Now, to simplify this ratio, let's do
a little bit more algebra kung fu.

38
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:12,664
Hi-ya.

39
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,400
Inserting these two fa factors,

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,570
which cancel, allow us to substitute the
known for the frequency relationships.

41
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,790
In particular,
their product is just the constant,

42
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,290
1 divided by the cube root of 6.

43
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,430
Neat.

44
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,030
All the unknown constants went away,
which is great because man,

45
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,590
life is complicated enough
when you know the constants.

46
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,070
Am I right?

47
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,080
The last step is just recognizing that
you already know what the ratio of

48
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,420
TA divided by TB is.

49
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,620
So plugging in all the constants, you
should get the cube root of nine halves.

50
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,880
That is ugly.

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,150
In regular people numbers,
that's about 1.65.

52
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:55,110
That's greater than 1, which means
system C is still faster than system A.
