00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,920
Protecting sensitive health data
divides into three sub areas.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,700
Privacy in health care means
that only individuals or

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,200
entities authorized by the patient
may have access to their data.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,130
So a patient's record may be stored
digitally in the EHR of a hospital, but

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,730
that doesn't mean anyone in
the hospital can access it.

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:28,120
It can only be accessed by people
authorized for specific purposes.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,640
Security is preventing
unauthorized access to the data by

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,650
outsiders such as hackers.

9
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,020
This is a particular concern
where data is being shared.

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,030
Just as with financial records,
health data has value and

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,750
must be protected at all times and
in all places where it resides.

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,990
Trust means knowing
that the individual or

13
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,850
entity with whom is being shared
is who they say they are.
