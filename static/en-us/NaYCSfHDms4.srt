00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,560
So now your app gets the data special
out of the tag manager container.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,800
When you update the daily special
variable in tag manager and

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,900
republish the container your
app picks up the changes.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,160
But what if your user
doesn't speak English?

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,850
Wouldn't it be nice for them to see
the daily special in their own language?

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,710
>> Why didn't you say so before?

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,755
Now I'm going to have to
update the code in my app.

8
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,750
>> Don't worry.

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,150
No code updates needed.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,680
Seriously, to make this change you
don't need to update your code.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,535
We can handle it all in tag
manager using a built-in variable.

12
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:38,240
So come with me and we'll delve into the
wonderful world of built-in variables.
