00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's go the cancer example. These are prior probability of cancer we should call P₀.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is a probability of a positive test given cancer. I call this P₁

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and careful, there's a probability of a negative test result for don't have cancer and I call this P₂.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Just to check suppose probability of cancer is 0.1, the sensitivity is 0.9, specificity is 0.8.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Given the probability that a test will come out positive.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,077
It's not Bayes rule yet, it's a simpler calculation and you should know exactly how to do this.
