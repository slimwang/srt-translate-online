00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,884
To find the x intercept, we let y equal 0. If we solve the equation, we notice

2
00:00:04,884 --> 00:00:09,112
that x is equal to 3. So, the x intercept occurs at 3,0. To find the y

3
00:00:09,112 --> 00:00:14,104
intercept, we let x equal 0, solving for the variable y, we can see that y would

4
00:00:14,104 --> 00:00:18,781
equal 2. And, on a graph, we could see that the x intercept would be here and

5
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:21,895
the y intercept would be here.There's out line.
