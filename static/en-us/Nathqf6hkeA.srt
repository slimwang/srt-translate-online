In this exercise, I want you to add another indicator to my watch like object.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,236
I've started by putting a magenta sphere in the scene of radius 10. I've

3
00:00:08,236 --> 00:00:11,765
positioned it correctly but it's not looking at all like a hand. Your job is to

4
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:15,230
stretch and squish this sphere into something looks kind of like a clock hand

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,886
but centered at the origin like this other hand. I want this hand to be 60 units

6
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:25,298
long and 4 units wide and high. Use the scale parameter to modify the sphere.

7
00:00:25,298 --> 00:00:30,114
Once you've properly scaled this sort of an hour hand, rotate it so it points at

8
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:34,673
11 and 5 o'clock. When you're done things should look like this.
