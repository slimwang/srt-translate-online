00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,482
Let's look more closely at these two number puzzles. I put the first two here,

2
00:00:04,482 --> 00:00:08,882
and the second two here. In our number puzzles, these were the products. So

3
00:00:08,882 --> 00:00:13,292
explain the observation: if the product is negative, what's true about the

4
00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:18,077
factors, and if the product is positive, what's true about these factors? Check

5
00:00:18,077 --> 00:00:20,780
all the statements that are true in each case.
