1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,392
Since we have y plus 3, instead of just y, this graph will be shifted three

2
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:08,626
down, from the graph of y equals x squared, and because we have x minus 2

3
00:00:08,626 --> 00:00:13,675
instead of x, it'll be shifted two, to the right. Remember that when were adding

4
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:18,475
constant terms, whether it's next to y or next to x, we're shifting in the

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:23,291
negative direction along the respective axis. So since we're adding 3

6
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:28,190
vertically, we're moving down and since we're subtracting 2 horizontally, we're

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,235
moving in the positive direction along the x axis.
