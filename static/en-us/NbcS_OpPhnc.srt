1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,721
Now, this problem is more challenging. But we'll start it out just the same as

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:09,026
before. We'll change logarithmic form into exponential form. We'll have m as

3
00:00:09,026 --> 00:00:15,194
our base, negative four as the exponent, and 1 16th as the result. So we know m

4
00:00:15,194 --> 00:00:22,030
to the negative 4 equals 1 16th. Since we're looking for this base m, we want

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:27,220
this to look like something raised to the negative 4th power. If the powers

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:32,426
match, then we know what m is. Well, we can rewrite 1 16th as 16 to the

7
00:00:32,426 --> 00:00:38,904
negative 1st power. Remember, a negative exponent makes a reciprocal. So 16 to

8
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:46,153
the negative 1 equals 1 16th. Now we can rewrite 16 as 2 to the 4th. We'll have

9
00:00:46,153 --> 00:00:52,340
2 to the 4th, which is 16, raised to the negative 1st power. Now, we can

10
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,092
simplify this line. We know that when we raise a power to another power, we

11
00:00:56,092 --> 00:01:01,362
really multiply them together. So, 2 to the 4th raised to the negative 1 equals

12
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:08,431
2 to the negative 4th. Now, this exponent and this exponent are the same. So,

13
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:11,392
we know that the bases must also be equal for these numbers to both be equal to

14
00:01:11,392 --> 00:01:17,736
one another. This is how we get a value for m equal to positive 2. Nice

15
00:01:17,736 --> 00:01:20,350
solving, if you got this correct. I know it was tough.
