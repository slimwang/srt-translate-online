00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Thrun] I want to show you a little animation of hidden Markov models

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
used for robot localization.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is obviously a little toy robot over here that lives in the grid world,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and the grid world is composed of discrete cells where the robot may be located.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This robot happens to know where north is at all times.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's given 4 sensors, a wall sensor to the left, to the right, to the top

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and the bottom over here, and it can sense whether in the adjacent cell there's a wall or not.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Initially this robot has no clue where it is. It faces what we call a global localization problem.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It now uses its sensors and its actuators to localize itself.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So in the very first episode the robot senses a wall north and south of it

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but none west or east.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And look what this does to the probabilities.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The posterior probability is now increased

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
in places that are consistent with this measurement,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
like all of those places have a wall in north and east, like these guys over here,

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and free space in the left and the right,

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
yet they have been decreased in places that are inconsistent, like this guy over here.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
These states over here are interesting. They are shaded gray and lighter gray.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What this means is they still have a significant probability

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but yet not as much as over here,

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
the reason being that this measurement over here would be characteristic

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
for the state over here if there had been exactly 1 measurement error--

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
if the bottom sensor had erred and erroneously detected a wall.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Errors are less likely than no errors, and as a result, the cell over here

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
which is completely consistent ends up to be more likely than the cell over here,

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
yet you can see the HMM does a nice job in understanding the posterior probability.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let's assume the robot moves right and senses again

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and gets the exact same measurement.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Of course it has no clue that it is exactly over here.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It can see the probability as being decayed.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Interestingly enough, this guy over here has a lower probability,

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and the reason is by itself it is very consistent with the most recent measurement,

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
but it's less consistent with the idea of having moved right and measured before

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
a wall to the north and the south.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And similarly, these places over here become less consistent.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The only ones that are completely consistent are these 3 states over here

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and the 3 states over here.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The robot keeps moving to the right,

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and now we get to the point where the sequence of measurement

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
really makes 2 states equally likely--the ones over here.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
They are equally likely with symmetry.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Those are still pretty likely, and those are gradually and likely over here to the left.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
As the robot now moves, it moves into a distinguishing state.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It sees a wall in the north but free space in the 3 other directions,

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and that renders the state over here relatively unlikely,

46
00:02:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and now it has localized itself.
