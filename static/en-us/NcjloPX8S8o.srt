1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,870
Now rewards are what users get for
performing actions.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,070
It could be likes on a post, or
maybe some extra coins in a game for

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,500
doing something.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,720
The most important question
here is whether or

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,270
not your reward leaves
the user wanting more.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,440
So how are your rewards
making users want more?

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,600
Use this box to record your thoughts.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,470
And if the answer is they
don't actually want more,

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,290
you might want to rethink your rewards.
