00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,990
Back in the introduction, we spoke
a little about the various programming

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,680
models that you'll use when
building Android applications.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,800
And in particular,
using Services to build them.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,200
One pattern that is
available to developers for

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,450
a synchronous programming in Android
is when you use an IntentService.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,650
When using these, clients send requests
through a method called StartService.

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,100
And if needed,
the service then starts and

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,940
it handles each intent in
turn using a worker thread.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,870
It captures all of these in
the onHandleIntent override and

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,740
when it runs out of work,
it will simply stop itself.

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,490
This design pattern is commonly
called a work queue processor and

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,330
it's often used to offload tasks
from an application's main thread.

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,880
We'll be using one in this sample but
I won't go into depth on how it works,

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,670
just on how we can use it for
our own needs.

15
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,240
If you're interested on how
it works on a deeper level,

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,130
take a look at the resources
in the instructor notes below.

17
00:00:59,130 --> 00:00:59,830
Let's get started.
