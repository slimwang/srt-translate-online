1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,770
So there's still one more feature
that you could add to the project

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,060
to round out the functionality
around registering for a conference.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,320
One obvious gap is that
currently there's no way to

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,360
unregister from a conference.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,420
Feel free to add the end points method,

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,040
unregister from conference if you're so
inclined.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,390
Take a look at the conference
registration function.

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,710
It will be helpful in doing this.
