00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,680
Before visually inspecting which selected features have

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,620
the most discriminating power, what kind of transformations do

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,930
you think will improve the discriminating power of the selected features?

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:12,660
1.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,760
Principal component decomposition.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,460
2.

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,080
Using a bootstrap method to generate more points.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,870
3.

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,484
Scaling the features.

10
00:00:21,484 --> 00:00:22,620
4.

11
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,220
