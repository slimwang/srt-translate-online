00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,010
Git doesn't any commits when you create the repository.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,420
You'll have to do that yourself.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,410
So the correct answer here is zero.

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,620
Now Git could create an initial commit with everything in the directory, but

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,590
it doesn't do that for a couple of reasons.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,850
The first is you might not want to commit everything in the directory, and

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,770
second, you wouldn't be able to write your own commit message if

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,670
Git created the commit for you.

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,140
You can find out what commits are in your repository by running git log.

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,020
Let's try that out on this new repository.
