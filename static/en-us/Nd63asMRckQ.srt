1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's look more at what we got from dir(s).

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We can see that the first part of it all these parts up to here.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
All these methods start with two underscores. We have names like <u>None</u>.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
These also known as special method names or more co-locally known as magic methods

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and the reason they're magic is that they can be used in special ways.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
For example, the _eq method, well that's the one that's used when we have a double equal.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Another interesting one is the _str method.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is what happens when we print s, it's actually turning that into str of s,

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and str uses this method.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So, for this quiz, your goal is to find the set method

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
that will provide the desired behavior that we specified for union.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So, if we do a.. method passing in b, that would mutate a to be the union of a and b.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We haven't told you what that method is yet but you should be able to figure it out yourself

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
using experiments as well as the documentation if necessary.
