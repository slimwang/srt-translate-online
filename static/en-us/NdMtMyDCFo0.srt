1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,230
So welcome Jeremy, thank you for
coming in and talking to us.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,860
>> Of course,
I can't wait to see what you've got.

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,000
>> Yeah, so
what we've got here is essentially,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,580
a to do list, slash calendar app.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,570
And I'd just like you to take a look
at this, and try to make a new event.

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,740
Sorry, a new task.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,624
>> Okay, so looking at the homepage,
I see I've got this sign in button, so

8
00:00:19,624 --> 00:00:22,204
that's a nice different color,
very obvious.

9
00:00:22,204 --> 00:00:23,021
Let me hit it.

10
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:26,560
All right, so now I'm in the main
screen of the application and

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,680
I see I've got this
big button right here.

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,938
So I bet that creates a new task.

13
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:35,850
All right I've got a new untitled task,
see if I can get a name, or is this

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,670
the prototype the text fields are-
>> Yes,

15
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,560
the text fields aren't
working right now.

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,090
I can see you want to
be able to use them you

17
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,380
want to be able to type in things.

18
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,516
>> So, I want to click through
all of these and then,

19
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:47,721
hit the big create button.

20
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,390
>> Yep, awesome.

21
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,220
>> Okay.
>> So, you've made a new event.

22
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,330
That's awesome.
>> That was very clear.

23
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,253
>> Now, can you just sort of
navigate through the app.

24
00:00:58,253 --> 00:01:01,710
See if there's anything that makes
sense to you as an extra feature.

25
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,414
See if there's anything
that you want to explore.

26
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:06,430
How would you go about
exploring this app, first off?

27
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,360
>> Well, let me just scroll down,
all right.

28
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,310
So I've got my list of tasks,
there's nothing else down there.

29
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,353
Let me see if I can move back and
forth through the days,

30
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:14,919
I presume in the full
app that would work.

31
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:17,185
>> In the full app that would work,
but right now we don't have that?

32
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:20,866
>> Well the only other thing that I see
to explore is this menu button up at

33
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:23,035
the top, so let's see what we've got.

34
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:26,565
Okay, we have a bunch of different
options, should I just pick one or?

35
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:28,653
>> Yeah, sure,
just explore a little bit.

36
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:32,859
One thing that I want to see especially,
is your reactions to certain of these

37
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,335
pages, so you know the overview page,
the calendar pages.

38
00:01:36,335 --> 00:01:37,899
>> Well let's check out
the overview page first.

39
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,480
>> Okay, so I have this list of,
I assume these are different collections

40
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,215
of tasks that I've done
stuff with in the past.

41
00:01:47,215 --> 00:01:50,873
And then some graph of I guess,
how often I've used things,

42
00:01:50,873 --> 00:01:53,042
how often I've completed things.

43
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:56,368
>> Would this be a useful thing to
use as somebody who's going to use

44
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:56,990
to do apps?

45
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,430
>> Not really, I don't particularly
care about when I completed tasks,

46
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,250
I just want to look at my current
list of tasks that I have to do.

47
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,800
>> Awesome, so can you go back and
find your current list of tasks?

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,160
So, I think Home,
probably take me there.

49
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,890
Yeah, so
this is everything I needed to do today.

50
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,490
This is kind of my primary
mode of interaction

51
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,700
with a to do list app, I think.

52
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,400
>> Perfect.
And if you wanted to check off a task,

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,930
say you finished your
meeting with Jacqueline,

54
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,470
how would you go about doing that?

55
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,460
>> Well, it looks like
there's this big empty box,

56
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,910
which I imagine is a check box.

57
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,140
>> Okay.
Yeah, and in the final app,

58
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,260
when you click that, that would check
off and something would happen there.

59
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,532
What would you expect to happen
when you hit that check box?

60
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:36,652
>> I would imagine that it would just
kind of like animate out of the list and

61
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:38,850
other events would slide up and
slide into place.

62
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,463
>> Awesome, thank you.

63
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:41,868
So you've given us great feedback.

64
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:42,947
I appreciate your time.

65
00:02:42,947 --> 00:02:43,946
>> Absolutely, this was fun.

66
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:46,142
>> Perfect, thank you Jeremy.
