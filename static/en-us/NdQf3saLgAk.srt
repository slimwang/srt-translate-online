[Peter] This one was a little tricky, but you should get it if you understand assignment.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The answers are all of them except this one,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and we'll go over each one one by one.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I've initialized their values to represent colors,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but they can be any integer as described in the question.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The first line of code states that a refers to what x refers to,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
so let's change that.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The second says that a now refers to what a refers to

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
plus 1, so now a refers to a new number,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
which is the red triangle plus 1.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
At the end of these 2 statements, x still equals

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
what it was originally, and that is the red triangle.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
A and x as described refer to initial values.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The first line of code says that a refers to what x refers to,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
so as we did in the last problem, we result in that a and x

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
both refer to the red triangle.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now x refers to what a refers to.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, as you can see, a also refers to the red triangle,

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
so the result of this is that x still refers to the red triangle,

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and since that's what it was initially, the value of x has not yet changed.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In this choice, the value of x changes.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's show you why.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The first line of code says that x now refers to what it used to refer to plus 1,

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
so we're going to create a new value that is the red triangle plus 1

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and change what x points to.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The second line says x should now refer to what x refers to.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, it doesn't change what it's referring to now,

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
which is the red triangle plus 1.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The end result is that x does not refer to the red triangle any longer,

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
which is why it's not the correct choice.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The forth choice may be a little bit of Python that you haven't seen before.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What this says is a should equal x,

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and x should equal a.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The end result is that x and a swap.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's see what that looks like,

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and I'll draw this all the way around here.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
X and a have swapped values.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
X now refers to the green triangle, and a the red triangle.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The second line of code is exactly the same as the first.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's going to swap them again,

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and if you swap 2 things twice,

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
you get what you had before,

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
so since x refers to the red triangle still,

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
it's a correct choice.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
In the last choice, we have a third variable x, a, z.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We initialize z to the value of x,

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
which is the red triangle.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We then assign a to what z refers to,

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
which is also the red triangle.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And lastly, we set x to the value of a.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
A refers to the red triangle, so x also refers to the red triangle.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The end result is the value of x hasn't changed.
