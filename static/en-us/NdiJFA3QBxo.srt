00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,450
The relationship between the structure of these sentences, and

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,170
background knowledge is very intricate, and complex, and

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,920
very entrusting as well. Sometimes the structure of sentences can be used to

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,030
tell stories, have only implied actions in them. Consider the sentence,

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,120
John fertilized the field. Now it's hard to see fertilized mapping,

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,110
into any of the primitive actions that we had here.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,700
There is an implied action here, that is not specified in the structure,

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,400
the sentence here. But, it is much more meaningful in terms of

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,060
the background knowledge that we have of those primitive actions. What John

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,740
fertilized the field really means, is that John put the fertilizer on the field.

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,768
Now put is something that maps in the primitive actions more easily.

12
00:00:39,768 --> 00:00:42,880
The response under the feature that's processing.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,830
Initially the inner agent must talk for the word, given in the sentence. And

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,263
try to map in the primitive actions. And if that fails, then the [INAUDIBLE]

15
00:00:50,263 --> 00:00:53,872
agent must start thinking in terms of how to transform on the sentences,

16
00:00:53,872 --> 00:00:58,200
to bring out implied actions, that can more easily map the independent actions.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,360
This, again, is common sense reasoning. Through common sense reasoning,

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,379
I'm interpreting that there must be implied action here,

19
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,060
that captures the meaning of the sentence. Once I have made the implied action

20
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,860
here transparent. The the rest of the processing, easier. The put action,

21
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,300
maps into the primitive action of move object, this frame is pulled out, and

22
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,730
the rest of the slots can be filled in, like earlier.
