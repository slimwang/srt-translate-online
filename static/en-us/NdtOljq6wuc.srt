Welcome to homework 5.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the first problem, you're going to build some intuition for what happens to a robot's path

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
when one of the these parameters, either toe p, toe d, or toe i, is set equal to 0,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
so if we don't include that term in our steering angle equation.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
In each of these 4 cases on the left, the black horizontal line is the intended track for the robot,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
while the pink represents its actual motion.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In each of these cases, the robot has a 10 degree positive drift

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and starts with a cross check error of 1.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
For each of these 4 cases, you should go through and decide which of these radio buttons

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
is the correct selection.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So for example, if you thought that this was appropriate robot motion

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and all the parameters were tuned correctly,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
you would select no problem.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Keep in mind that each column should be selected exactly 1 time. Good luck!
