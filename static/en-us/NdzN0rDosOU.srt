1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,020
So those are the participants.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,870
Now, let's talk for a minute about the review meeting itself.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,830
For a effective reviews, the review meeting should be itself, be structured.

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,930
This includes the following steps.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,590
First off, introduce the participants to each other.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,810
They might not previously know each other.

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,830
In particular, one effective strategy would be to

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,330
bring in a member of a different team.

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,970
who's, you know, has a similar level of expertise, but to, to put a different

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:33,500
set of eyes that may not be biased by the you know, common understanding.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,090
Second, is a statement of objectives by the moderator.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,570
This is a reminder that the purpose of the meeting is to raise concerns over

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,210
specific artifacts.

14
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,760
And not get diverted into problem-solving or, or other other issues.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,100
Third is an evaluation of the preparedness to determine whether

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,470
the meeting can go forward.

17
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,480
This involves checking with the reviewers as to whether or not they had done

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:02,050
their preparation, and to collect their issues that they've already found.

19
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,280
And also to check whether the artifact itself is ready for review.

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,870
Next is the systematic review itself using some means of ensuring thoroughness,

21
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,760
and we'll look at some of those in a minute.

22
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,420
This is where the term walk-through is very important.

23
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,210
The actual going through the artifact in a very systematic step by

24
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,930
step fashion to make sure the whole thing is covered.

25
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,220
During this process it could be recording of results in

26
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,910
the form of the issues raised on the review form.

27
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,410
After the systematic review, but still inside the meeting, there should be

28
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:38,430
some kind of summarization, often led by the recorder of the issues raised,

29
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,870
including a determination of severities and priorities.

30
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,400
Finally a determination of who is responsible for looking into these issues.

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,220
In many cases it will be the author.

32
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,790
But it may be that in certain cases somebody else gets assigned to do that.

33
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,410
There should also be an agreement about how resolution will be verified.

34
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,890
With respect to is it the moderator's responsibility?

35
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,530
The author's?

36
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,584
Or is there going to be a view review
