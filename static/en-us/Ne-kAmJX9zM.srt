1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,885
Do you remember Wingdings?

2
00:00:01,885 --> 00:00:02,719
>> [LAUGH].

3
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,660
>> That weird font that was
oddly popular in the 90's?

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,820
Have you ever wondered why a font
like that would even exist?

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,720
>> Well, as it turns out,
it's possible to build a font family

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,960
made of images and
icons rather than letters.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,810
Now, icon fonts provide
a fantastic option for

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,979
the little images and
icons that often decorate websites.

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,440
There's an icon font
I like called Zocial.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,650
Now, this font is free and
open source, so

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,380
I could download it and
serve it from my site.

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,210
However, the font is publicly available
from the font site itself so,

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,030
I'll use that instead.

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,440
Let's see it in action.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,660
Notice that I've added some
shadow to the font icons.

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,900
This file looks a bit complex so,
bear with me.

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,440
Here's what's going on.

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,330
The icon font characters are added
using the CSS before selector.

19
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,540
I've added some formatting to that
as well including CSS text shadow.

20
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,790
Now that rule is applied to
every element whose class

21
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,550
name begins with zocial.

22
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,800
And you can see that each of
the list items has a class

23
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,080
with a name made up of zocial and
a brand name.

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,472
Now, at the top,
you'll see an @import url,

25
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,740
that points to an external CSS file.

26
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,510
Let's look at that now, the @font-face
url, at the top of this gives the source

27
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,570
of the actual font files and
there's some variations available there.

28
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,310
And what you see below that
are selectors based on class names like

29
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,010
the ones we've used, zocial-flickr,
zocial-laughter and so on.

30
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,660
For example, set the class
zocial-flickr on an element and

31
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,660
the character F will be
displayed before it.

32
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,150
Which in the zocial font
is the flickr logo.

33
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,550
Clever, huh?

34
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,400
Icon fonts have a number of advantages,
over plain old images.

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,480
They're vector graphics that
can be infinitely scaled and

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,230
an entire set of images can
be downloaded in one font.

37
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,740
And this makes them a great potential
solution for responsive designs where

38
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,060
you require minimum downloads and
maximum scalability.

39
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,970
Now, if you look at
the resources required for

40
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,905
the weloveiconfonts site,
you can see that the total weight for

41
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:15,845
that hundred of images from all
the fonts on the page is less than 300k.

42
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,190
Icon fonts have a number of
advantages over plain old images.

43
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,190
They're vectorgraphics that
can be infinitely scaled.

44
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,530
An entire set of images can
be downloaded in one font.

45
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,760
This makes them a great potential
solution for responsive designs where

46
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,300
you require minimum downloads and
maximum scalability.

47
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,330
The example here shows lots of
different options for icon fonts.

48
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,170
And of course the characters
in icon fonts behave

49
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,100
just like letters in other fonts.

50
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,630
So you can resize and color them and

51
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,510
use other CSS effects,
just like you would with text.

52
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,975
There are lots of tools for
creating icon fonts and

53
00:02:56,975 --> 00:02:59,575
lots of pre-built icon fonts.

54
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:01,715
Check out the links below the video.

55
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,895
There's also a link to information
about improving accessibility

56
00:03:04,895 --> 00:03:05,785
