1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,019
The axis property makes this stack
view arranged the contained views

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,259
vertically or horizontally.

3
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:09,730
This can be changed in run time and
even animated.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,200
The first examples,
we'll use a horizontal axis.

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,480
But later on,
we will introduce vertical ones too.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,760
>From now on,
I will assume a horizontal axis.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,820
Just keep in mind that everything
works also with a vertical one.
