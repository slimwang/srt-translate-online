In the new space for the getFriends method I want to start by creating a string

2
00:00:03,258 --> 00:00:07,592
that I can use to collect all of the names. Now I'll want to add all of the

3
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:11,380
friends. So I'll loop through all of the friends, one at a time, and I'll add

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,530
the separator and the ith friend's name onto that variable I was using as the

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,948
collector. But as this is right now it's going to print out a separator before

6
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:25,330
the fist name. So I need to look for a special case. In the regular case, where

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,740
we're not looking at the very first friend, we'll add the separator and the

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,051
friend's name. But if we are looking at the very first friend, then we just add

9
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:37,176
the friend's name. I'll just fix a couple syntax errors, and I'll remember to

10
00:00:37,176 --> 00:00:40,653
return that variable that I used to collect all the names and now when I run

11
00:00:40,653 --> 00:00:44,244
the tester, I can see that it works with whatever kind of separators I put in,

12
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:50,389
whether it's a semicolon, a vertical bar, or a unicode heart.
