00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,810
To really understand objects and classes, it's best to work with lots of

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,490
examples. Let's try another example. And again, it's a great idea if you can do

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:14,170
this together with me. In BlueJ navigate to the pictures project in lesson two

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:19,200
and you will see here an icon representing a picture class. Let's make an

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,880
object of that class. Again, I will accept the default name, and here is my

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,560
object. What can I do with it? Well you know how to find that out. You right

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,470
click on the object and you get a list of things that tell you the methods.

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:40,650
Let's pick a method and in fact we will pick the method called pick. This

9
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:47,020
particular method opens up this file chooser here. That lists whatever image

10
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,160
files happen to be available. You can also navigate to other folders but we'll

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,880
just pick one here. Once you pick a file, a window pops up that shows the

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,450
image. Now let's see what else we can do. Let's call the pixels method. And it

13
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:07,575
tells me that this particular image has 104,976 pixels. Okay, that's

14
00:01:07,575 --> 00:01:14,200
potentially interesting. over here we have method called translate. Let's just

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,174
play with it to see what it does. It wants two numbers. I will just put in 100

16
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:27,570
and 200, click on OK. And now look carefully at the planet. as you see, it

17
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:34,020
moved. So the method is not called translate because it doesn't translate this

18
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,840
into Lithuanian. Translation is a mathematical way of saying moving and it

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:49,860
moved it by 100 pixels in this direction and 200 pixels in that direction. So

20
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,700
this is another great example of an object. The object can do certain things.

21
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,680
The methods tell you what it can do. In the next exercise you get to play with

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,135
objects of the picture class.
