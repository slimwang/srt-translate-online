Video compression works in slightly different ways.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,620
Each video is a sequence of images and

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,250
each image can be compressed with spacial redundancy,

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,040
exploiting aspects that humans tend not to notice.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,650
Also there is temporal redundancy. Between any

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,380
two video images, or frames, there might be

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,200
very little difference. So if this person was

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,210
walking towards a tree, you might see a

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,350
version of the image that's almost the same,

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,400
except with the person shifted slightly to the

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,610
right. Video compression uses a combination of static

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,190
image compression on what are called reference frames,

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,360
or anchor frames, sometimes called I frames, and

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,660
derived frames, sometimes called P frames. The P

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:50,910
frame can be represented as the I frame, compressed. If we take the I frame and

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,570
divide it into blocks, we can then see that the P frame is almost the same

17
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,510
except for a few blocks here that can be represented

18
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:07,580
in terms of the original I frame blocks, plus a few motion vectors.

19
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,050
A common video compression format that's used on the internet is called MPEG.
