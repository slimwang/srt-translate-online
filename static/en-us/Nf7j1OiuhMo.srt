00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,506
Every since my first online Java program, back in 1997, I've been excited by

2
00:00:03,506 --> 00:00:08,087
the potential of the Internet to teach 3D graphics. Interactive 3D graphics,

3
00:00:08,087 --> 00:00:11,238
with speed and quality equal to that seen in AAA title games and high-end CAD

4
00:00:11,238 --> 00:00:15,820
packages, is now possible on the web. I'm also thrilled that we can now share

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,635
programs in a straightforward way. No installs, no compilation, and anyone can

6
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:24,187
look at the code being run. Udacity's motto is Learn, Think, Do. I find that

7
00:00:24,187 --> 00:00:28,112
perfect for interactive rendering. You don't need to buy a DNA sequencer or

8
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:32,170
array of radio telescopes. You have everything you need at hand.

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,398
Experimentation is easy and quick with 3js. The only danger is the risk of

10
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:40,212
staying up till 4 AM saying, what if I twiddle with this parameter. I ran

11
00:00:40,212 --> 00:00:44,119
across a great quote from Confucius while making this course. Every truth has

12
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,918
four corners. As a teacher, I can give you one, but you must provide the other

13
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:51,070
three. This suits my view of computer graphics. You can be given a firm

14
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,670
foundation, but you're the one who really needs to pursue knowledge and learn

15
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,793
by doing. Confucius probably meant something different. Don't forget you have a

16
00:00:57,793 --> 00:01:01,276
giant reference library at your fingertips. Much of what I found for these

17
00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:04,135
lessons consisted of me typing in 3JS collision detection and seeing what the

18
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:08,762
search engine popped up. Developing any sort of interactive 3-D graphics

19
00:01:08,762 --> 00:01:11,934
program was out of reach of almost everyone 20 years ago because back then

20
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:16,790
graphics accelerators cost the price of a luxury car. Now they're the price of

21
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,064
a large pizza. Even up until a few years ago, creating a 3-D application

22
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:23,496
involved compilers and downloads and installs and once you were done, it would

23
00:01:23,496 --> 00:01:28,130
usually work on only one operating system. If you ran someone else's glorious

24
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,889
demo, you were usually less Scratching your head. How do they do it? The fact

25
00:01:31,889 --> 00:01:35,039
is you can now make a wonderful 3D interactive that anyone with a browser can

26
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:38,139
access with just a click and can read the code that created it with just a few

27
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:44,418
more. How amazing is that? There's so much you can do, figure out what someone

28
00:01:44,418 --> 00:01:49,298
else's code does, write your own programs, write your own libraries. Even

29
00:01:49,298 --> 00:01:53,845
contribute to 3JS itself, and if you do, document it. Go off and do great

30
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:55,950
things, and whatever you do, send me the link.
