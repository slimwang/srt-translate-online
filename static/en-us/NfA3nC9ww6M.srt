1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,390
So let's look at what's actually happening here to our two curves on this

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,262
coordinate plane, to create this black line over here. What I've drawn right

3
00:00:08,262 --> 00:00:13,530
now, is a bunch of lines going from the x axis up to our curve. Or our line,

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,035
rather, f of x. What happens graphically when we want to add 3 to the length of

5
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:23,376
each of these lines, is that we're shifting them up. So that they start,

6
00:00:23,376 --> 00:00:27,618
instead, at the line, y equals 3. If we connect these lines now, we end up with

7
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:32,311
a curve that looks just like our black line. Over there. So this line is

8
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:35,784
identical to the reddish one, just with every single point translated up 3

9
00:00:35,784 --> 00:00:40,188
units. This is exactly what we were talking about with transformations in the

10
00:00:40,188 --> 00:00:43,800
last lesson. Working with the same two functions as the last quiz, what if we

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,005
want to subtract one of these functions from the other? One of these three

12
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:53,930
graphs represents f minus g of x, and another one of them is g minus f of x.

13
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,640
Which one is which? In this top row of bubbles, please select f minus g. And in

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,136
the bottom row, please pick which one is g minus f. I wanted to keep the

15
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:05,597
functions written here for you. I'd recommend thinking about this graphically,

16
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:08,369
but if you need to work with the equations of the functions, and combine them

17
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,719
mathematically first, before you pick the graphs, that's also totally fine.
