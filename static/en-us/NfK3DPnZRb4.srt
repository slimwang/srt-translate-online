00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,490
We've spent quite a bit of time
talking about the activity lifecycle,

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,990
the Android component that is tied to
the user interface of your application.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,060
But some tasks just don't fit nicely
into the lifecycle of a single activity.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,875
For example, you might trigger a change
inside of the preferences activity

5
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:18,954
that require the database
to re-sync with the server.

6
00:00:18,954 --> 00:00:21,754
It doesn't make sense to run
a synchronization task within

7
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:23,024
the preference activity.

8
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:26,875
Which will soon be destroyed when
the user return to the MainActivity.

9
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:30,434
In fact it doesn't make sense to do
network transactions that talk to

10
00:00:30,434 --> 00:00:33,479
a database inside of an activity.

11
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,239
It has nothing to directly do with
the user interface of the application.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,429
That's where services come into play.

13
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:42,619
Services are one of the four
primary Android components as

14
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:44,659
described in the Android manifest.

15
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:48,949
Including activities, content providers,
and broadcast receivers.

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,940
All connected using Intents.

17
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:51,820
Services are meant for

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
long running background tasks which
don't need a visual component.

19
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,450
Because of this services,
unlike activity,

20
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,570
do not provide a user interface.

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,179
An activity can start a service,

22
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:05,980
which will then continue to run even
after the activity is shut down.

23
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,646
Therefore, services are great for things
like processing loading and processing

24
00:01:09,646 --> 00:01:12,695
of data in the background even when
non of these activities are open.

25
00:01:12,694 --> 00:01:16,597
For example, the fact you will get
email, text messages and calendar

26
00:01:16,597 --> 00:01:20,899
reminders even when all these apps are
closed is because there are background

27
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:24,757
services running on your phone
listening for and downloading data.

28
00:01:24,757 --> 00:01:28,804
When you send an email message and
navigate away from Gmail a service is

29
00:01:28,804 --> 00:01:31,615
what makes sure that that
message gets sent out,

30
00:01:31,614 --> 00:01:34,349
even though your activity is closed.

31
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:35,019
All right.

32
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:38,689
Now that we know the basics of services,
let's compare them to a framework

33
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:41,340
component we're already familiar with,
loaders.
