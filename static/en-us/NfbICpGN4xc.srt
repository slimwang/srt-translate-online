1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,430
All right, now we know what image gradients are.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,210
In this lecture, what we're going to do is,

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,970
we're going to build on the concept and start computing edges.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,420
Now, edges are one information theoretic way of looking at

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,680
very minimal information within an image.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,930
What we will actually propose is, using this will help us get

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,750
towards feature detection, which we will actually study later.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,840
But, in this lecture, what we're going to do is now learn more about how we can,

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,295
in reliable ways, extract information from images, like edges, based on

10
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:34,340
image-creating computations that we learned how to do in the previous lecture.
