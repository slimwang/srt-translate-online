I want you to analyze the running time of Dijkstra and ideally, I would just ask you

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but given that you can't answer me directly,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to have to make this a multiple choice question.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And it turns out that you don't have enough information to answer it.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So for you to be able to answer it, what were do you need to know.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So the running time of Dijkstra in terms of n and M and here's a sketch of the algorithm again.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Remember for each node it finds the shortest distance so far--it removes that distance

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
from the set and then it checks each of the neighbors.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I've got a node that it found the shortest node--it does a little bit of competition--

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
constant competition for each of those before going up and starting again with another node.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But you will have enough to answer this question--is it because the running time depends

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
on how find shortest is implemented, is that because it depends on the degree of the nodes

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
in question or is it because it depends if the graph is dense or sparse.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You'll get a different answer in those cases. So just check which one and I'll give you some feedback.
