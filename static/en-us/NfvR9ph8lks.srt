00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:05,790
Not necessarily. Remember, these data are purely correlational. We can't make

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,600
causal statements using these data, for the reasons described at the end of

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,130
lesson 14. Remember, correlation versus causation? Anyway, there are many

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,950
variations of multiple regression. Including ways of adding or dropping

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,900
predictor variables. Deciding what variables should be included in the final

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:28,030
equation, types of criterion variables, etcetera. It's often difficult to

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,189
account for all the possible factors that could influence the dependent

8
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,830
variable. Maybe if you go on to more advanced statistics classes, you'll get to

9
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:41,800
learn those methods, but now you have a basic understanding of a very complex

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,610
topic. Great job!
