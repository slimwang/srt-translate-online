1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,330
And the answer here of course is that at least one vertex is added to the potential vertex cover

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,150
each time we go down here in this tree or we branched because there's only three possibilities

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:16,970
and in this possibility here, we add one vertex, and this possibility here, we also add one vertex,

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,470
and here we will add too.

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,230
And of course, there then comes data reduction and all that jazz,

6
00:00:21,230 --> 99:59:59,999
but we're always adding at least one.
