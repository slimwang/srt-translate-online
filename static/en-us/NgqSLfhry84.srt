1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,050
I feel like this is the best I can do.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:06,420
Our output Y should equal
the square root of X.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,110
But it looks a whole lot
like our signature so-

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,030
>> Well, not only does it look like

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,720
the signature, but
it's circular definition, right?

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,750
>> Right.
>> Okay, we haven't gotten any place.

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,540
So what is the relationship, the numeric
relationship between X and Y?

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,200
State it in words.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,150
>> X times itself equals Y.

10
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,560
>> Y times itself equals X?

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,920
>> Oh, yes, sorry.

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,500
Backwards.

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,960
[LAUGH]
>> So why don't you write that down?

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,000
>> Okay.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,900
>> So, Y*Y=X.

16
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,110
That, in fact, is something that must
be true after square root executes.

17
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,350
And so it's a post-condition.

18
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,100
And in fact it is the only thing
we need to worry about, okay?

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,120
So it completely specifies
any routine which we would

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,840
believe to be a suitable
square root routine.

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,280
As long as the output that you get when
multiplied by itself gets the input,

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,200
you say it's the square root.
