00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:03,397
So now I want to have a quiz to see that you understand multiple inheritance and

2
00:00:03,397 --> 00:00:07,230
see where it can get tricky. So suppose we add an init method to both the Black

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,006
Bear and the Discerning Bear classes, and that init method is going to use

4
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:15,294
super, passing in the Black Bear here, passing in Discerning Bear here, calling

5
00:00:15,294 --> 00:00:18,997
init, but adding to the name. Black in front of a Black Bear and Discerning in

6
00:00:18,997 --> 00:00:22,802
front of a Discerning Bear. Then, we'll define Discerning Black Bear with two

7
00:00:22,802 --> 00:00:26,822
based classes, the Discerning Bear and the Black Bear and no attributes defined

8
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:30,393
inside the Discerning Black Bear. Then, we'll create an instance of the

9
00:00:30,393 --> 00:00:33,928
Discerning Black Bear passing in Mortimer as the name. And I'll give you five

10
00:00:33,928 --> 00:00:36,886
choices, it could be Mortimer, it could be Black Mortimer, it could be

11
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:40,099
Discerning Mortimer, it could be Black Discerning Mortimer, or it could be

12
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:43,483
Discerning Black Mortimer. What do you think Mortimer's name will be?
