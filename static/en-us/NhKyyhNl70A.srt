[Narrator] And here the histogram filter scores better.

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Even though it was discrete, it was able to represent multiple bumps,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which the kalman filter couldn't, so it's unimodal.

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If you forget this go back to the past class and look at this.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The kalman filter was a single Gaussian which is by definition unimodal,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
whereas the histogram filter can have bumps over arbitrary grid cells.
