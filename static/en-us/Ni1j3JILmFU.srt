1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So here's my quiz on vanishing points.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The question is: How many vanishing points may exist in a single image?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Exactly 1 answer is correct here.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We already encountered it in an example with 2.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So perhaps there's 3, 4, 6--

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
or even infinitely many.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So what's the maximum number of vanishing points you may possibly encounter in an image?
