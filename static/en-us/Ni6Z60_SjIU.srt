1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,910
With our routes and

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:05,080
database in place, we can now add the
actual CRUD Functionality to our page.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,960
Write in the appropriate SQLAlchemy
statements for the following methods.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,220
We also need to add url_for and

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,600
redirects to our application,
when necessary.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,850
Some of our routes need to be able to
respond to get, and post requests.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,910
Be sure to add this functionality,
as well.

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,230
When you are done with this step,
you should have a prototype,

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,560
where all the CRUD operations
are fully functional.

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,850
This might be a time consuming iteration
to get everything working, but

11
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,330
I encourage you to stick with it,
and not give up.

12
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,300
Use the documentation on the Python
Flask in SQLAlchemy websites if

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,350
needed, as well.

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,940
Also do not hesitate to reach
out to your fellow students.
