1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:06,030
Given this current state, we can apply means ends analysis veritably.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,100
Now, if we apply means on some of those to this particular state, the number of

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,880
choices here is very large, so I will not go through all of them here.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,560
But I'd like you to write down the number of possible next states. As well as,

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,060
how many of those states reduce the difference to the goal? Which is given here.
