1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,202
Our domain goes from 4 to 7, not including either 4 or 7. In other words, x can

2
00:00:05,202 --> 00:00:10,385
take on any value between 4 and 7. Remember, when we're looking for a domain on

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:15,745
our graph, the only thing we're considering is x coordinates, for which there is

4
00:00:15,745 --> 00:00:19,079
a point on the function. The y values here don't matter at all.
