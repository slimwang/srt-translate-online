00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,820
Here's a simple Android app using
street view to show a scene.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,630
As I move my finger around the display,

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,250
you can see that I can
look around this location.

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,870
As I touch the arrows, you can see
that I can walk along the trail.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,370
Similarly, if I touch in the far
distance, I can jump to that location.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,670
This location is a hiking
trail in the Grand Canyon.

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,219
And as you can see, street view
isn't limited to just streets.

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,060
As I touch in the direction of the hike,
I simply follow the path.

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,750
This one actually goes all the way down
to the bottom of the Grand Canyon.

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,600
This virtual hike down
the Grand Canyon was built

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,950
using only a few lines of code.

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,950
Let's take a look at how to
build this for ourselves.
