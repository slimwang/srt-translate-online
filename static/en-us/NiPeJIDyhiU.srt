00:00:00,153 --> 00:00:04,820
So now, let's think about the geometry of stereo and get to the mathematics.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,179
The basic idea is this.

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,319
If I have two cameras and

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,171
remember, cameras are defined by their optical centers.

5
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:10,915
All right?

6
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:14,538
And they're both looking at some scene point,

7
00:00:14,538 --> 00:00:20,075
if I can figure out which two points in the two cameras are the same point.

8
00:00:20,075 --> 00:00:23,821
And furthermore, if I can tell which way, if I know something about which way

9
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:27,296
the cameras are pointed, then I can figure out the depth of that point.

10
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:28,213
That's it.

11
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:31,386
So for estimating the depth between the stereo, remember the shape

12
00:00:31,386 --> 00:00:34,459
between the two views, there are two things we have to consider.

13
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:38,917
First is information on camera pose and sometimes referred to as calibration.

14
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:42,481
How are the cameras oriented in space with respect to each other.

15
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:45,674
And the second is on image point correspondences,

16
00:00:45,674 --> 00:00:48,356
that is which point corresponds to which.

17
00:00:48,356 --> 00:00:51,307
So here you see the red dot in the two images, left and

18
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:54,276
right are both corresponding to that front corner.

19
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:57,260
What we're going to do is we're going to swap that order.

20
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,165
We're going to talk about doing the image correspondence first,

21
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:03,337
because that's the what you're going to do for your problem set and

22
00:01:03,337 --> 00:01:06,211
it's all, it's the fundamentals between stereo matching.

23
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:09,837
And then we save calibration for later, because calibration is also used for

24
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:13,407
whole bunch of other types of geometric processing that we're going to do

25
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,320
with the cameras.
