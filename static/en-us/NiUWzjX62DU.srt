1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,410
Okay, square root's easy.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,880
Sort's going to be harder, as far as the por, postcondition is concerned.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,910
So I'd like you to, let's go back for

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,800
a minute to the natural language specification and revisit that and

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,030
then consider what the postcondition of sort's going to be.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,700
So we said in the natural language specification.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,100
That the output vector Y must be ordered, and

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,370
somehow the contents of Y must be the same as the contents of X.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,299
That is, everything in X must be in Y, everything in Y must come from X, and

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,940
the number of occurrences must, must match up.
