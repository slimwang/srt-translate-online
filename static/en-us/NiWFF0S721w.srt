00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,400
There are many examples of how the media misrepresents studies. For example,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,320
here are some recent headlines based on a real scientific study. Husbands who

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,340
do more housework may have less sex. Want to have more sex? Men stop doing

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,140
chores. Men not doing chores. Having a lot of sex. These media headlines are

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,650
based on a correlational study that measures the time and type of chores,

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,280
masculine and feminine and the amount of sexual encounters. In this study, they

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,910
found that couples who split the type of household chore, masculine versus

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,310
feminine reported five sexual encounters per month. However, when men completed

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,502
approximately 17 hours of masculine type chores and women completed

10
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:47,080
approximately 35 hours of feminine type chores they had nearly two more sexual

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,220
encounters per month. Chores or types of chores, masculine versus feminine. And

12
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,800
sexual encounters in this example. A variable is any characteristic that can

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,470
vary across individuals or across time within the same individuals. And this is

14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,300
a correlational study. Because we are not manipulating any variables. Instead

15
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,140
we are just simply observing a mathematical relationship between two variables.

16
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:18,240
In this case chores, the number and type, masculine versus feminine and the

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,200
amount of sexual encounters. An important distinction in correlational studies

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,280
is that they do not manipulate any variables. Instead we're just measuring to

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,290
see whether the variables are related. This differs from experimental studies,

20
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,360
wherein researchers actually manipulated independent variable; and measure the

21
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,910
effect on the dependent variable. We will cover these types of studies, after

22
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,059
looking at correlations.
