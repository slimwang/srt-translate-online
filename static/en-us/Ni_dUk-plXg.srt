1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,820
There are a lot of essential topics
that you'll need to cover to become

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,000
an iOS developer.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,730
Building interfaces with the ui kit,

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,550
accessing the world
content with networking.

5
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,950
But right now it's time for

6
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,250
us to figure out what happens
when the app is turned off?

7
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,200
When the phone is turned off, or
even when just the app is turned off,

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,460
there's app state that
should be persistent.

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,900
You need to get some of the state out
of the RAM and onto the hard drive.

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,140
We're going to want Apple's four
main persistence techniques,

11
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,400
listed here in increasing complexity.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,120
There's a good chance that you haven't
heard some of these, or all of these.

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,800
That's okay.
We'll cover the material in

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,130
five lessons.

15
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:32,890
This is lesson one,

16
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,840
and you can see that we cover the two
straightforward techniques right away.

17
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,200
By the end of the five lessons you'll be
able to start the virtual tourist app,

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,460
the fourth portfolio project
in the iOS nano degree,

19
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,890
to let you collect travel
pictures without leaving home.

20
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,010
The app stores travel locations on
a map and lets you download and

21
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,220
store Flicker images for locations.

22
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,620
If we select a location we can download
images from Flicker associated with

23
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,350
the latitude and longitude.

24
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,540
We can remove pictures that we don't
want and then save the collection.

25
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,520
Now, if the app is turned off,
the location and images are saved.

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,000
There are a number of different
ways that apps can be turned off.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,500
The easiest way is to double
click on the home button.

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,290
This displays the app switcher,
we can turn apps off by sliding them up.

29
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,220
The virtual tourist app will use
core data for its persistence.

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,430
But in this first lesson let's start
with some simpler technologies.

31
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,872
I want to help you master these two
simple persistence technologies that all

32
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,883
iOS developers need to have in
their tool kit: user defaults, and

33
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:26,380
saving files in the documents directory.

34
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,880
To give us something
concrete to work on,

35
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,260
we'll revisit the app from Kunal's
course, the pitch perfect app.

36
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,900
One more note on this course: the format
will be different than courses

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,050
one, two, and three.

38
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,070
The content is mostly going to be
presented to you in written form.

39
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,870
We think that at this stage,

40
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,690
this is the most efficient way to guide
you through the material, but it's all

41
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,412
the more reason to keep in contact with
your fellow students as you try it out.

42
00:01:45,412 --> 00:01:47,240
All right, let's start out
by seeing what it means for

43
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,090
an app to be turned off.
