1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,284
The F-statistic we calculated is greater than our critical value. Therefore, we

2
00:00:05,284 --> 00:00:08,910
reject the null in favor of the alternative. At least one group is

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,598
significantly different. And I think we know which one it is. We easily

4
00:00:13,598 --> 00:00:18,084
realized this, simply using our intuiition at the beginning of the lesson. But

5
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:22,436
usually the situations we use in ova four are much more complicated, and with

6
00:00:22,436 --> 00:00:27,926
much larger data sets. And it's impossible to look at lists of hundreds or

7
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:32,417
thousands of values and just know if they're different. But also in those those

8
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:36,710
cases, we wouldn't calculate the F-statistic by hand. We would use software.

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,614
The purpose of this lesson was mostly for you to understand the reasoning

10
00:00:40,614 --> 00:00:46,264
behind the F-statistic, and learn how it's calculated. Great job.
