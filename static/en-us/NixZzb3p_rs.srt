1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The first answer can't be true because the units of measurement are wrong.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This would be tons divided by tons which would leave us with a measurement unit of 1

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and years per ton won't work either--we had to have tons per year,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the rate of change of a number of tons, so this doesn't work.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This expression would not more the growth but the decay of fish minus the constant

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
times the number of fish and this would be something like immigration not harvesting.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Some constant is being edit to the rate of change.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We have an immigration of 4 times 10⁵ tons per year, so these two can't be the answer,

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and we are left with the third one--0.5 per year times the number of fish.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The positive growth rate as is appropriate for exponential growth

11
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and then there is a loss with a minus sign, which models harvesting.
