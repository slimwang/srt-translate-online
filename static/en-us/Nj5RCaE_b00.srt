1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,150
Let's ask one of our front-end engineers how he does the same thing.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,780
Now, he's hard at work, so I'm going to have to find some way to get

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,350
his attention and remind him that he agreed to talk with us.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,788
I think the dart gun should do the trick.

5
00:00:14,788 --> 00:00:16,881
[NOISE].

6
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:17,646
>> Hi.

7
00:00:17,646 --> 00:00:18,470
I'm Jacques.

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,310
I am the lead front-end engineer here at Udacity.

9
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,920
And I've been with the company now for about two and a half years.

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,380
And I was just going to run you through sort of how I approach a new design.

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,509
So when I get something like this.

12
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:33,700
Everything on the web is boxes.

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,220
So I start out sort of understanding and

14
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,110
cutting up the boxes that I'm going to use.

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,260
And that starts with the big box that is your whole page.

16
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,290
And from there I sort of split it up piece by piece and

17
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,550
we work from big to small.

18
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,510
So in the first cut it's going to be there's a big box at the top here for

19
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,550
your head content your logo your text that kind of stuff.

20
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,720
If you have a big box here with your image in it.

21
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,760
You have a big box here with this footer all these footer elements.

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,078
As you can see, actually, inside of the footer,

23
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:09,828
there are three sort of small boxes with those image and text.

24
00:01:09,828 --> 00:01:14,062
And one sort of box that goes across the top of it with this featured work.

25
00:01:14,062 --> 00:01:18,460
And so I work from the, from the big side into the small side.

26
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,370
And when I started out, I did this with pencil.

27
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,550
I, you know you start drawing out here's a big box,

28
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,810
this is going to be the header.

29
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,480
And you can actually fill in the content later, you don't actually have to

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,060
worry about it, you can move from the big to the small.

31
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,760
So how you're going to position this logo here,

32
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,550
how you're going to make this text show up.

33
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,590
You can put that off till later,

34
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,300
those are smaller boxes, so start with the big boxes.

35
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,230
And work down from there.

36
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,800
So just sketch it out.

37
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,070
And as you do this more often, you'll be able to do,

38
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,470
start doing it in your head.

39
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,210
But if you're having any trouble, especially starting out, just go for a pencil.

40
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,230
It's a great tool.
