1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,020
David, what did you write?

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,710
>> So starting at the beginning, has
wings becomes the predicate has wings.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,100
We're doing a conjunction so
and, does not have fur, so

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,760
not has fur,
those two things imply that it's a bird.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,110
>> That's good, David.

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,600
Now, let us put this in a form,

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,000
in a conjunctive normal form that we
can use in resolution theorem proving.
