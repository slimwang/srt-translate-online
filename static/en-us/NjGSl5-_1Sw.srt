1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The force on this mass refers to mass times the acceleration,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
which is 1.63 m/s², but we know where this force comes from--

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
namely, from gravity, so it has to be equal to the constant of gravitation times

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the product of the masses, the mass of the moon -- let's call that m₁,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
times our mass, m₂, divided by the distance squared.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The distance is the radius of the moon.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now let's ignore this part of the equation.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Then you see that m₂, the mass of our object, doesn't matter,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and we can solve for m₁.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If you plug in the value of the constant of gravity and do the math,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
you get 7.3 x 10²² kg.
