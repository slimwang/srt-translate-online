1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,556
The answer is that we're not done yet,

2
00:00:02,556 --> 00:00:07,020
because the algorithm works by doing
the goals tests when we take a path off

3
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:10,118
the frontier not when we
put a path on the frontier.

4
00:00:10,118 --> 00:00:12,936
Instead, we just continue
in the normal way and

5
00:00:12,936 --> 00:00:16,469
choose the node on the frontier
which has the lowest value.

6
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:22,579
And that would be this one, the path
through Pitesti with a total of 417.
