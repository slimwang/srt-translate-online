00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,710
So at this point, I’ve mentions bake
lighting several times and have kind of

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,160
hand wavingly said its pre-computation
that we do before we run our experience.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,640
You’ve probably noticed that it results
in very high quality experiences that we

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,100
couldn’t get with the same
real time computation.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,470
While the quality is great, I should
mention that there are some compromises

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,990
that you need to make in
order to actually use baking.

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,370
And it can't be used just like that.

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,140
So what exactly is it?

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,400
Let me throw that question at you and
let you take your best guess.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,580
Don't worry if you
don't know it just yet.
