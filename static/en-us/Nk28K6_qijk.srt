00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,550
Here are few tips for
creating a text campaign.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,110
First you really want to highlight
what makes your company stand out.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,530
Why are you unique?

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,180
Include prices, promotions,
or other exclusives.

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,350
People often do searches because they
want to make a decision about something.

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,290
Now if they're trying to decide what to
do with their dog while they're away,

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,860
let's help them make that choice.

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,650
Don't forget a call to action.

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,590
Tell a customer what they can
do to get what you're offering.

10
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,280
Like sign up today,
book your first visit, things like that.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,850
Don't forget about your keywords.

12
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,490
Be sure to include your
keywords in your ad

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,750
to show how relevant you
are to their search.

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,010
For example, if they're searching for

15
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,722
earn extra income, our headline
could be earn income by dog sitting.

16
00:00:40,722 --> 00:00:43,560
We're going to talk about keywords
more later in the lesson.

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,250
Your ad needs to match
your landing page.

18
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,555
You want to make sure that customers can
easily find what they are looking for,

19
00:00:49,555 --> 00:00:51,365
and see the relevance of your ad.

20
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:54,577
Also this relevancy will help you
later with your SEO performance,

21
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,045
it'll help influence your ad placement.

22
00:00:57,045 --> 00:00:59,143
Think about it from your
customer's perspective.

23
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:02,085
If they want to come to your site
because you're offering a two month free

24
00:01:02,085 --> 00:01:04,435
subscription, don't make them look for
it.

25
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:06,655
Get them in and hooked right away.

26
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:09,595
And finally experiment,
run a few different ad groups and

27
00:01:09,595 --> 00:01:11,000
different types of ads.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,980
See which ones perform the best.

29
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,590
You can track your messaging and figure
out what ads are going to be best for

30
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,110
you and your customers.

31
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,450
Okay, now I want you to
create your own campaign.

32
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,570

you would run for your own company.
