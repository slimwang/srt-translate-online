1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,570
And the solution to that is 32 because we have 5 communication centers,

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,220
and for each communication center we have to construct a separate solution--

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,870
one where the communication center does receive a monitoring device,

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,640
and one where it doesn't.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,700
So we have 2 possibilities for the first one, then 2 for the second one, and so on.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 99:59:59,999
And this is 2^5 which is 32.
