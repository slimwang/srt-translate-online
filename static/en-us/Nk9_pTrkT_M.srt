1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,180
So, in summary, I introduced the whole
concept of video stabilization,

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,230
with the caveat that of course,
I introduced our own algorithm,

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,330
a very specific, but very simple
algorithm, to do video stabilization.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,740
I demoed a working system.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,530
This is a widely used system, used by
millions, you should have access to it.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,210
I encourage you to
upload videos to it and

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,050
try it out, and tell me what you think.

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,250
Discussed the whole concept of
degrees of freedom that are used to do

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,410
the motion modeling of a camera that
can be used to create smooth paths.

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,110
Discussed how can we actually
take the rolling shutter and

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,620
remove the rolling shutter artifacts
from the video to actually improve our

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,760
video stabilization for
casual hand-held cameras.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,239
And again, I showed a system that
you can play around with yourself.

14
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,040
I encourage you to look at the papers,
the two papers of ours up there.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,780
I've also listed two other papers
that actually talk more about

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,790
rolling shutter.

17
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,550
I'm going to put pointers to
other additional papers on

18
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,140
video stabilization
with this lecture also.

19
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,120
Again more information is available
from there and from my website.
