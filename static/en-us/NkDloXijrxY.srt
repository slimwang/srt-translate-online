1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,781
So right now,

2
00:00:00,781 --> 00:00:04,834
the saveProfile method only returns
a profile without really saving it.

3
00:00:04,834 --> 00:00:09,217
And the getProfile from user function
will change all of the fields back to

4
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:10,778
the defaults every time.

5
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:13,946
That means that if we use it from the
front-end every time we'd have to fill

6
00:00:13,946 --> 00:00:15,979
in the correct values to
replace the defaults.

7
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:20,400
Instead, we probably want to get the
existing entity from the datastore and

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,550
maybe just update one field not all.

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,760
So the getProfileFromUser function
should actually get a saved profile from

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,666
the datastore,

11
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:31,048
instead of always creating a new
one from the default values.

12
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:32,418
Let's see how to do that.

13
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:34,352
Getting an entity from the datastore,

14
00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:36,760
if you know the entity's
key is extremely easy.

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,475
You just perform get
on the key like this.

16
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:42,750
So now,
it's your turn to do this in your app.

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,364
Since you're already creating the
profile key, all you need to do is get

18
00:00:46,364 --> 00:00:49,693
the entity from the datastore
instead of defining that it's not.

19
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:52,540
And then in doProfile,
if you get a save_request,

20
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,985
we also want to put the modified
profile back to the datastore.

21
00:00:55,985 --> 00:00:59,607
And of course, don't forget to deploy
your app to local host and test.

22
00:00:59,607 --> 00:01:02,170
So, as you complete each one
of these check them off and

23
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,430
then fill in this missing code to
fetch a profile from the datastore.
