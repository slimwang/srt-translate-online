If you have trouble picturing this think about a mountain climber. It would be

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,166
harder for a mountain climber to walk from left to right across this graph than

3
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:11,757
it would for someone to walk from left to right on this graph but we're

4
00:00:11,757 --> 00:00:15,852
mathematicians and it's not enough to know that this line is steeper than this

5
00:00:15,852 --> 00:00:19,782
line. I want to know how much steeper, I need a way of quantifying steepness In

6
00:00:19,782 --> 00:00:24,235
algebra we use something called slope. Slope compares the distant a line rises

7
00:00:24,235 --> 00:00:28,941
or falls to the distance aligned runs from left to right. We write slope as the

8
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:33,890
ratio of rise divided by run. For example, let's look at this line. We'll look

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,684
at the graph between x equals 0 and x equals 1, so we're between here. In this

10
00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:43,519
region we have a run of 1 so I'll put 1 in the denominator. How much would this

11
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:45,940
rise be? Use the graph to help you out.
