1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,346
This one here is the correct answer. Let's see why. The first two can't be

2
00:00:03,346 --> 00:00:08,818
right, because we're multiplying with a decimal number here. And then when we

3
00:00:08,818 --> 00:00:13,335
divide, we're not going to get an integer. We're going to get some fractional

4
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:19,302
number, 0.0 and a little bit, 0.9 maybe at this end, and so on. But that's not

5
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:22,490
what we want. We wanted to reduce these, this range of integers to that range

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:27,290
of integers. So it's gotta be one of these two, and now the question is do we

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:33,258
divide by 256 or do we divide by 255? And it doesn't seem like it would matter

8
00:00:33,258 --> 00:00:37,482
much, but it really does, namely if value happens to be the very last element,

9
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:44,155
if it happens to be 255. Then this equation wouldn't work, 255 times 6, again,

10
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:48,943
divided by 255 would be 6, and we're only supposed to get values between 0 and

11
00:00:48,943 --> 00:00:55,466
5. All right, here we have the formula, and now it's time to put it to work in

12
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:57,149
Java.
