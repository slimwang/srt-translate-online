1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,609
Earlier we learned about styles and

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:04,470
how you can apply them
to an individual view.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,580
If you want to apply it to all the views
in an activity or application,

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,330
you can do it by specifying a theme
attribute on the activity or

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,600
application tag in the Android manifest.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,990
Now we style the action bar to look
like these visual mocks for the main and

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,020
detail activity.

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,750
The settings activity is a special case
because it extends from the preference

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,100
activity class,
instead of the action bar activity.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,180
So that's going to be
done in the next section.

11
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,040
For both cases here we want
the background color to be this

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,330
blue hex color.

13
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,250
We notice that the detail activity
only shows the title, no app icon.

14
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,220
And this button is to go
up to the parent activity.

15
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,950
If you see visual marks
that have the app icon or

16
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,260
a different up button,
they are outdated.

17
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,570
The material design,
this is our new look.

18
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,380
On the other hand,
the main activity shows the logo.

19
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,200
It's a different attribute
than the app icon.

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,980
And this was provided in an acid
drop earlier in the lesson, and

21
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,350
it's called ic_logo.

22
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,630
Because of these differences,
we need two separate themes.

23
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,450
We use AppTheme for the detail activity
and ForecastTheme for the main activity.

24
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,660
In material design you can
choose several app colors and

25
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,700
specify them in your theme to
colorize certain UI components

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,380
that are controlled by the framework.

27
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,940
For example the framework will use
colorPrimary as a background of your

28
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,700
action bar or your tool bar.

29
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,160
The framework will also
use colorPrimaryDark

30
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,200
as the status bar color.

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,578
To customize our app theme, go to
the Styles file in the values folder.

32
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:34,480
Our AppTheme inherits
from the system Theme for

33
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,380
a Light app because we have a Light
content area with a DarkActionBar.

34
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,650
We specify colorPrimary to
be this sunshine_blue color.

35
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,050
And this will be displayed in
the action bar, also known as app bar.

36
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,770
And then we set the colorPrimaryDark
to be this darker color.

37
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,280
This is going to be
shown in the status bar,

38
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,340
and typically the status bar is
a darker color than the app bar.

39
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:03,315
Both of these colors are defined in
the colors.xml file as seen here.

40
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:07,290
Then for the main activity,
we create a ForecastTheme.

41
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,230
We inherit from AppTheme in case
there's more attributes that we want to

42
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,880
add here, and
then we'll inherit them for free.

43
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,460
However, we do override
the actionBarStyle.

44
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,510
This is so that we can set the logo
to point to this drawable file and

45
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,190
also change the displayOptions so
that the logo does appear.

46
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,410
For more information on
the action bar displayOptions,

47
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,940
you can see the list here.

48
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,100
If you run the app now,

49
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,320
there's a shadow below the action
bar that is default behavior.

50
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,990
However, according to our visual
designs, we want the action bar and

51
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,050
the today item with the blue
background to be on the same plane,

52
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,430
meaning we don't want one to
cast a shadow over the other.

53
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,450
As a result we set the action
bar elevation to be zero

54
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,140
if it is in one pane mode.

55
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,700
If it's in two pane mode, then the today
item does not have a special background,

56
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,380
and it's fine if the action
bar casts a shadow.

57
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,250
Go ahead and make these changes
now using the gists provided.
