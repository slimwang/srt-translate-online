1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,050
So let me show you another example of exactly how this kind of

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,130
taking pictures would be done.

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:09,090
And this time around with a handheld camera, which is on a iPhone, iPad or

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,930
an Android tablet, whatnot.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,020
Here we going to use a piece of software from Cloudburst Research,

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,740
which lets you do this by autostaging.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,560
So here you see the video as the person is rotating the camera.

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,740
Panning the camera in this instance, new picture is taken,

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,620
they are merged together, and again feature matches and

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,680
all that kind of stuff is done in real time.

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,153
So using this we can generate panoramas, just took five pictures.

12
00:00:41,565 --> 00:00:43,710
And you know, it's basically doing the alignment and

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,164
generating a panorama right there.

14
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:52,874
Of course, a whole lot of processing was captured and

15
00:00:52,874 --> 00:00:54,709
you know, controlled to generate this.

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,780
Another example would be another system again in a handheld system like

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,470
this here,

18
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:04,840
moving the camera, or moving the handheld device you're generating a panorama.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,080
And in this case it's pretty much doing it live also.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,990
And stitching things together and aligning them.

21
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,340
Again, the reason for showing this panorama as an example,

22
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,149
this is an easily accessible example and you have tools already doing it.

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,890
Of course now let's look at exactly the steps going on

24
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:26,870
in basically capturing to matching to warping to generate a panorama.

25
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,920
Here I'm basically going to show you the steps as used by

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,000
this specific software, but of course these are general steps that would be

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,380
applied across the board for any method.

28
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,660
So, if you notice what we've done in this case is basically put all of

29
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,470
these images.

30
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,120
And as I click on each and every one of the image, basically see

31
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,330
that image highlighted so there are you know, six and seven images here.

32
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,600
The same images I showed you.

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,180
And basically now all of them are a little bit warped,

34
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,830
registered, aligned to generate this panorama.
