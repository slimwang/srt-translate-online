1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,702
You should have calculated these for your proportions, then you can see that

2
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:09,411
relative to Canada for example, China has a lot more. You could also see this

3
00:00:09,423 --> 00:00:14,385
with absolute frequencies, but relative frequencies also give you a sense of how

4
00:00:14,397 --> 00:00:19,044
much of the whole they comprise. If we had include Kyrgyzstan in our example,

5
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:24,147
Kyrgyzstan would have had a proportion of zero, since 0 of these 50 students are

6
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:29,425
from Kyrgyzstan. If instead of looking at countries, we had looked at planets,

7
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:34,957
we would have found that all of our students are from earth, so earth would have

8
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:40,206
a proportion of one. In other words, 50 out of 50 of our students are from earth

9
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:46,255
and 50 divided by 50 is 1. This might give you a hint for the next quiz.
