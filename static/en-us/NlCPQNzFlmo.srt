00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,070
To plot 5,115, we start with the horizontal coordinate. Beginning at 0, we count

2
00:00:05,082 --> 00:00:09,835
to the right 5. And then, we deal with the vertical coordinate. From there, we

3
00:00:09,847 --> 00:00:14,460
count up 115. And that brings us to this point. But from bringing back our

4
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:19,596
graph, we can see another way that we could have figured this out. By looking at

5
00:00:19,608 --> 00:00:23,778
the line that we drew for the entire equation. Remember that on our table, we

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,060
saw 5 and 115 as a pair of values for d and n that belong together. Since it was

7
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:32,339
from that table that we developed our equation, and from our equation that we

8
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:36,734
got to this graph, it makes sense the graph would fit the table. What's really

9
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:40,885
cool about our line, though, is that our table only had the points that are

10
00:00:40,897 --> 00:00:45,228
highlighted here in orange. Those are all the data we were given. But now, with

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,546
this whole line, we can start to make some extrapolation about data later on.
