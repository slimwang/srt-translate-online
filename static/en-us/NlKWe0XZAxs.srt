1
00:00:00,425 --> 00:00:02,820
Okay, maybe that was a silly quiz.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,240
This command isn't going to send
anyone all of your money, and

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,280
it's not going to put
stuff in your hair.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,980
Curl is a command for
downloading files from the web.

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,620
Go ahead and run the command.

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,230
Pause the video if you need.

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:13,730
I'll wait.

8
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,000
And after curl finishes try ls again,

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,389
to see that it now prints
the name of one file, things.zip.
