00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,783
We've simplified terms by combining
factors within them, and we've combined

2
00:00:03,783 --> 00:00:08,984
like terms. So, let's try to do both of
those things at the same time. Here, we

3
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:16,332
have a very long expression, 15x squared
plus 3x to the 7th minus 7x times 2x minus

4
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:22,473
4 times 2x minus 5 times 4 plus x times 3.
That took a really long time to write and

5
00:00:22,485 --> 00:00:26,859
a really long time to say. So it would be
awesome if we could simplify this. That is

6
00:00:26,871 --> 00:00:31,096
what I would like you to try to do. Now if
this looks daunting, no big deal, just

7
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:35,548
give it a try. You have absolutely nothing
to lose. Writing your work on paper first

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,144
will definitely help you. Also, remember
to try to simplify within each term first,

9
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,976
and then once you've done that, to
identify what the like terms are in this

10
00:00:44,976 --> 00:00:48,053
expression, then you can work on combining
them together. Good luck.
