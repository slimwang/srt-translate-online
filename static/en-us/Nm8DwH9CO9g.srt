00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,196
So, let's recap this section really quick. We can be exposed to stressors, and

2
00:00:04,196 --> 00:00:08,585
they can be both pleasant and unpleasant. Like a vactions or a marriage, or

3
00:00:08,585 --> 00:00:13,162
death of a loved one. And both stressors can produce negative emotional

4
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:17,676
responses. And sometimes, these negative emotional responses can be difficult

5
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:22,720
to control. And when we encounter a stressful situation, we engage in primary

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,184
appraisal, which is our first reaction or assessment of a situation. However,

7
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:33,216
upon experiencing a negative emotional response produced by the stressful

8
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:39,000
event, we can also engage in secondary appraisal. Secondary appraisal is using

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,564
our self assessment and looking at the resources available to help us cope with

10
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:47,340
this stressful event. By engaging in secondary appraisal, we may be able to

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,162
reduce the level of negative emotions that we experience. So, in the shower

12
00:00:52,162 --> 00:00:55,660
handle example I showed you, it nicely demonstrates how I perceive the primary

13
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,084
event as very, very stressful. But upon my secondary appraisal, I was able to

14
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:03,012
lower my stress levels, because I realized how happy I was that the handle

15
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:08,078
didn't break off while the water was still running. I knew I really lucked out

16
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:11,304
with that one. I also realized the things I needed to do to make the problem go

17
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:15,528
away, such as calling the plumber. And this a way of coping with the situation.

18
00:01:15,528 --> 00:01:19,615
So, this again demonstrates that it's a person's perceived ability to deal with

19
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:23,641
a stressful event or stressor that results in a negative emotional response to

20
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:28,466
stress. If however, I was a handy plumber myself and a shower came off, I

21
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:33,050
wouldn't perceive the event as stressful at all. I would just fix it myself,

22
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:38,080
because I would have the skills I needed to solve the problem. Now, I might

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,676
still be a little stressed about the things I need to do to get the handle

24
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:43,404
fixed, but not as much as I could be, because I figured out how I want to solve

25
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:45,610
the problem.
