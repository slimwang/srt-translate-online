1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay. So what I'd like you to do now

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
is implement the function: escape_html ( ),

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
which will take one argument, (s),

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and will replace any occurrence of

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
the Greater Than symbol on that string with: >

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the Less Than symbol with: <

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Double quotes with: "

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and an ampersand with: &

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And then it should return this string

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
with this side replaced with this side.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay. Good luck!
