00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,940
Time for a little quiz.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,890
So when objects are really very, very far away.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,270
The real X, that is how far off from,

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,100
from the center they could be, might be huge, as the real Z.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,860
Could be miles.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:20,040
So if I move the camera, the origin, those numbers hardly change, right.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,350
The location of the real x out in the world,

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,070
the real layout in the world with respect to this point, and it's miles away.

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,460
If I move this a few inches, nothing actually changes very much.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,450
So this explains which of the following?

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,320
A, why the moon follows you.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,440
I hope the moon does follow you.

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,450
It follows me, but maybe I'm special.

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,680
Why the North Star is always North, that's b.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,570
C, why you can tell the time from the sun regardless of where you are.

16
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,300
And d, all of the above.
