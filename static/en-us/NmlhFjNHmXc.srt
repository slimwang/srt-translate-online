00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,752
>> One way statisticians deal with outliers is by cutting off the upper and

2
00:00:04,752 --> 00:00:09,873
lower tails of the distribution. So we're going to cut off Mark Zuckerberg. Then

3
00:00:09,873 --> 00:00:14,804
we only consider the data values in the middle. What do we mean by cut off the

4
00:00:14,804 --> 00:00:19,142
tails? Traditionally, statisticians cut the lower 25 percent and the upper 25

5
00:00:19,142 --> 00:00:24,093
percent. So let's say you have eight data values. We're going to cut off the

6
00:00:24,093 --> 00:00:29,646
bottom two, or the bottom 25 percent, and the top two, the top 25 percent. So

7
00:00:29,646 --> 00:00:33,940
all we care about are, are these values in the middle.
