1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,580
So, you might be wondering if you
don't have a phone, what you can do.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,980
Well, Android Studio has
actually provided a way for

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,310
you to simulate a phone
on your computer.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,250
This simulated phone has a fancy
name called the Android Emulator.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,330
To start the Android Emulator,
go ahead and

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,810
go up to the Run button and press Run.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,480
You'll see a small
loading circle down here.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,810
Now, whereas before I told you to select
the Choose a running device radio

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,900
button, you're going to want to choose
the Launch emulator radio button.

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,790
And here is a drop down of all
the different types of phones

11
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,320
you can simulate.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,550
Right now you should only have one, and
it's most likely going to be a Nexus 5,

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,910
which is the type of phone, and API 21
refers to the operating system level.

14
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,350
And x86 refers to a particular
type of hardware configuration.

15
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,930
Anyways, this is the name for
your simulated phone.

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,270
And I'm going to go ahead and
click OK to start the phone.

17
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:55,120
Now after about ten seconds, you should
see a black phone appear on the screen.

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,240
You'll also see this window here appear,
which will show any sort of error

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,020
messages or
activity messages from the phone.

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,239
Okay, so here's my black phone,
and I'm waiting for it to load.

21
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,070
After a moment of that, I'm going to
see this Android loading icon.

22
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,471
After a little bit more time,

23
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:13,270
you should see this welcome
screen appear on the phone.

24
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,220
To go ahead and start the phone,
swipe up from the bottom.

25
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,983
Now it's trying to simulate an actual
phone, and the first time you load up

26
00:01:20,983 --> 00:01:24,360
an actual phone, you get all
these help icons and dialogues.

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,325
I'm going to just click OK.

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,550
Now, if all goes well,
your app should appear on your phone.

29
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,850
It didn't for me, so I'm going to
go ahead and try to run it again.

30
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,310
Okay, since the emulator's
already running,

31
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,640
I can see it now under my
Choose running device.

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,519
So I'll go ahead and click it.

33
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,890
And I press the OK button.

34
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:44,660
All right, and it loaded up
my code on my emulated phone.

35
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,070
Now you should know that sometimes these
simulated phones don't always work

36
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,800
correctly the first time.

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,153
For example, you might have this issue
that I had the first time when I ran my

38
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:57,508
simulated phone where it would
just show the black screen or

39
00:01:57,508 --> 00:02:01,530
would just show the Android loading
symbol, and it wouldn't go beyond that.

40
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,470
These are actually fairly common errors
when trying to start a simulated phone.

41
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,479
And one of the reasons that we
suggest using a real device.

42
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,470
That said, for
the most part they're solvable problems.

43
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,570
So, if you are running into
those issues, go ahead and

44
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,760
look at the instructor notes for
how to deal with these situations.

45
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,710
We've provided a link to
a troubleshooting document.

46
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,450
Finally, since I have your attention,
if you're having difficulty with your

47
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,060
simulated phone, sometimes you have
clues in this error output over here.
