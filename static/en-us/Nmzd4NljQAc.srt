Alright, so I won't reveal the answer just yet.Let's go through the math. I know

2
00:00:05,145 --> 00:00:10,341
if college cost stay the same, I'd have a 100% of 22,000. That would just be

3
00:00:10,353 --> 00:00:15,652
22,000. I am going to increase that amount by 4.8%. So I need to find a 104.8%

4
00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:20,445
of the cost of college. Percent means divided by 100, so I move the decimal two

5
00:00:20,457 --> 00:00:25,875
places left. Of means multiply and the cost of college is $22,000. Now I'm going

6
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:30,673
to multiply these two numbers together and I get $23,056. Hopefully you're

7
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:35,830
enjoying some education at a little bit less price than that. Alright, nice work

8
00:00:35,842 --> 00:00:00,000
on that quiz. And that concludes our work with decimals and percents. Great job.
