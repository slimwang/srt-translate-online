00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,430
So how would you apply a problem reduction to Raven's Progressive Matrices?

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,360
Before we actually talk about how our agents would do it,

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,430
we can think about how we would do it. When we are solving a matrix, where do

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,940
the smaller or easier problems that we are actually breaking it down into?

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,880
How are we solving those smaller problems, and how are we then combining them

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,480
into an answer to the problem as a whole? Once we know how we're doing it,

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,070
how will your agent actually be able to do the same kind of reasoning process?

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,180
How will it recognize when to split a problem in to smaller problems?

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,520
How will it solve the smaller problems? And how will it then combine those in

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,350
to an answer to the problem as whole? During this process think about,

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,170
what exactly is it that makes these smaller problems easier for

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,870
your agent to answer than just answering the problem as a whole?

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,150
And how does that actually help you solve these problems better?
