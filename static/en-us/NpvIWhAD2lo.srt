With negative signs, reciprocals and exponents you want to be very careful. Math

2
00:00:04,399 --> 00:00:08,538
requires a keen attention to detail. Let's look at a couple of scenarios when

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,789
we'll be working with negatives, so that way you can see what I mean. We have to

4
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:16,677
be careful. Here I know it's just 5 squared or 5 times 5, so I get 25. For

5
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:20,937
negative 5 squared, I have the whole quantity of negative 5 squared, so I write

6
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:25,562
the whole thing in parentheses twice, so I have negative 5 times negative 5. I

7
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:30,130
know a negative times a negative is a positive, so I get 25. Here I have to

8
00:00:30,142 --> 00:00:34,900
remember back to my order of operations. Do exponents or the subtraction take

9
00:00:34,912 --> 00:00:39,838
precedence. I know exponents come first. Here I have a choice. I could have the

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,127
5 be negative, and then I can square it or I could square the 5 and then take

11
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:48,514
the negative. Remember back from the order of operations, we know exponents come

12
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:52,454
first. So I'll have 5 squared and then I'll have it multiplied by negative 1.

13
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,639
Oftentimes we don't show the multiplication here, but that's really what we

14
00:00:56,651 --> 00:01:00,747
mean. It's negative 1 times 5. This is why we have to be really careful about

15
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:04,879
what we need in math. That's why a lot of times we use parentheses, we want to

16
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:09,555
know if we're scoring in 5, negative 5, or if we're scoring a number and then

17
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:14,491
multiplying it by negative 1, they're all different. So for my answer I have

18
00:01:14,503 --> 00:01:19,549
negative 1 times 25, or negative 25, and finally 5 to the negative 2. Remember,,

19
00:01:19,658 --> 00:01:24,582
with negative exponents, we really do the reciprocal. So I'm going to have 1

20
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:29,355
over 5 and that's going to be squared. So I have 1 5th times 1 5th, or 1 25th.
