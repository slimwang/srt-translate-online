1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
To answer this question, all we need to do is press on run

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and you'll see that now we only require four tests.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You see how delta debugging splits the list, quickly finds a sub-list that is just two elements,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
checks each of them and finds the one element that causes the test to fail.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The correct answer here was 4.
