00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,296
Now we're on to our fourth practice problem. What do you think the solutions

2
00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:06,954
would be for this radical equation? Notice we have a constant in front of this

3
00:00:06,954 --> 00:00:10,951
radical sign. We can leave this in front of the radical, we just want to make

4
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:16,914
sure when we square both sides, we square the 4 and we square the radical. Try

5
00:00:16,914 --> 00:00:19,890
it out on your own, and then see if you can find the correct answers, or maybe

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,970
there's just one answer, or no answer. Good luck.
