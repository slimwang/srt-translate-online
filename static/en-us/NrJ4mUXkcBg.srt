00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,975
The first step we need to take to move toward getting x alone, is to subtract

2
00:00:04,987 --> 00:00:10,275
1200 from both sides. Then, our last step is to divide both sides by 6.5. On the

3
00:00:10,287 --> 00:00:15,575
left side, we end up with 690. And on the right side, we have just x. So, that's

4
00:00:15,587 --> 00:00:20,759
our answer. Connecting this new piece of information back to our story, the

5
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:24,771
solution to this equation tells us that Grant manufactured 690 glasses wiper

6
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:28,444
sets in the first month. If you think back to where we were at the very

7
00:00:28,456 --> 00:00:32,671
beginning of this lesson, you've made a ton of progress in learning about how to

8
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:36,883
solve equations. If there's anything that you don't feel 100% comfortable with

00:00:36,895 --> 00:00:00,000
right now, go back and re-watch the videos covering it. Awesome job.
