Hi, my name is Mark Barunstein.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,730
After a long career in
Health Informatics,

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,130
I've been teaching it here at
Georgia Tech for the past few years.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,950
It's about the applications of
information technology to healthcare

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:13,490
delivery.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,770
This is distinct from Bioinformatics,

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,130
a related field with which
it is often confused.

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,480
That is about building
computational models.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,600
And using other
approaches to analyze and

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,600
understand the complex, intracellular,
biochemical mechanisms.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,484
The term Biomedical Informatics is often
used to denote the merger of these two

12
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:37,824
fields into one training,
and or research program.

13
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:42,083
As you'll learn, even though healthcare
delivery is a very data dependent

14
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:46,209
activity, here in the US it has long
resisted the adoption of information

15
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:50,087
technology even though they're in
common use in other industries.

16
00:00:50,087 --> 00:00:51,502
Partially as a result,

17
00:00:51,502 --> 00:00:56,350
the US has many problems delivering
efficient high quality care.

18
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,890
Many people feel the solutions,

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,130
at least in part,
are through the widespread adoption and

20
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,560
proper use of the information
technologies you'll be learning about.
