00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,760
What do you think, David?

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,560
>> So perhaps unsurprisingly,
I said that the two most similar

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,830
situations in my original answer were
both deeply and superficially similar.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,700
A woman climbing a step ladder
is both deeply similar in that

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,260
the relationship are the same.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,640
And superficially similar
in that the woman and

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,550
the ladder are somewhat similar.

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,910
I also said that the woman climbing
a set of stairs is both deep and

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,320
superficially similar.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,580
We still have a woman climbing in both,
and

11
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,460
I said that a set of stairs is somewhat
superficially similar to a ladder,

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,630
in that both are designed
to allow someone to ascend.

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,060
Although some others might say that
that's not superficially similar.

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,000
Then I said that the other three that
involved rising in some way were all

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,480
deeply similar as well.

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,600
The plane taking off into the sky,

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,510
the woman climbing the corporate ladder,
and the ant walking up the wall were all

18
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,550
deeply similar to me because all
involved this relationship of climbing.

19
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,850
I said that the woman painting a ladder
was only superficially similar,

20
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,170
which is why it was one of the lowest
rated in our original exercise.

21
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,460
And finally the water bottle sitting
on a desk is neither deeply similar nor

22
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,440
superficially similar,

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,510
because nothing is the same
between those two situations.

24
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,730
>> This is good, David.

25
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,330
Once again, different people may give
different answers to this exercise.

26
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,370
Why did we do so?

27
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,940
Well, let's examine it next.
