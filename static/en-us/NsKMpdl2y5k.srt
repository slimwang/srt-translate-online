1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,737
if we pick a value within each of these intervals for only one that satisfies

2
00:00:04,737 --> 00:00:09,877
this inequality this value is from the middle interval. Negative 45 is less than

3
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:14,370
or equal to x is less than equal to 10. We can write this using interval

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,735
notation as negative 45, 10 with square brackets.
