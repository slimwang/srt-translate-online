00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,730
Once you've become comfortable with how
the increment method is working and

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,450
how to update a variable based on
the current value of that variable,

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,900
then do the same for
the decrement method.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,241
In the decrement method, initialize the
quantity variable to two cups of coffee,

5
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:15,738
then decrease it by one cup.

6
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:19,136
I bet you never thought you'd be
doing so much coffee cup math, but

7
00:00:19,136 --> 00:00:21,636
it's helping us learn Java,
so it's worth it.

8
00:00:21,636 --> 00:00:23,492
Also use the debugger
to step through and

9
00:00:23,492 --> 00:00:27,145
verify that the quantity variable
is being updated as expected.

10
00:00:27,145 --> 00:00:29,410
Once you become more
comfortable with variables,

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,950
you can eventually skip this step of
using the debugger because you'll be

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,690
able to keep track of all the values
of the variables in your head.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,350
But since you're starting out, if you
like seeing the concrete value in front

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,110
of you at each step in the code, then go
ahead and continue to use the debugger.

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,550
Check these boxes when you're done.
