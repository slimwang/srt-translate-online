00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,317
Here's what I did. I checked how many passengers I already have, now I want to

2
00:00:04,317 --> 00:00:09,606
add a new person. And of course, there's the driver. So if passengers size plus

3
00:00:09,606 --> 00:00:13,913
2, one for the new person, one for the driver, is less equal the number of

4
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:19,288
seats, then I'm good. I also have to check the destination. So, and if the

5
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:22,884
destination is below the destination of this car, in that case I can add the

6
00:00:22,884 --> 00:00:27,880
passenger and return true. Otherwise I won't add and return false.
