00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,216
Similarly, let's try multiplying that parent function of y equals x squared by

2
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:12,122
negative 1 half. Again, compare to the graph of y equals x squared and figure

00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:18,353
out whether it's facing the opposite direction, wider, narrower, or facing the

4
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:19,768
same direction.
