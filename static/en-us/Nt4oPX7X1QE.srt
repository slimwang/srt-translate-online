1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well, let's make ourselves a little scratch room and work it out.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There are only 1, 2, 3 letters, a, b, and c involved,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
so let's take a look at each one by one, see if it fits.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Suppose I was in state 2456 and I saw an a.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If I'm in 2 and I see an a I die, 4 and I see an a I die,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
5 and I see an a I die, 6 and I see an a I die.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's not good.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
2456 on a goes to failure.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It does not go to 23.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
All right, well, what if I see a b?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If I'm in 2 and I see a b, I go to 3. That looks pretty good.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
4 and I see a b I die.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
5 and I see a b I go to 2.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
6 and I see a b I die.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, b took us to exactly 2 and 3.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
2456 on b went to 2 and 3.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But let's just finish checking up on c just in case we missed something.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm in 2456.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
2 on a c goes nowhere.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
4 on a c goes nowhere.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
5 on a c goes to 6,

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and 6 on a c goes nowhere, so 2456

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
on a c goes to 6.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Actually, we already have that edge, 2456 on a c goes to 6,

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and since this machine is deterministic, we only want 1

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
outgoing edge here labeled c.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It looks like b was our winner.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The label for this edge is b.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now, this is not a proof,

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
but it just so happens that any non-deterministic machine

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
can be converted to a deterministic machine

32
00:01:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
using exactly the same steps.
