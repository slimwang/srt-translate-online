1
00:00:00,645 --> 00:00:03,820
What's an example of a data visualization that you've seen that

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,020
tells a subjective story, rather than an objective one?

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,560
>> There's a bunch.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,680
Probably the most well known one that I would fit in that category,

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,555
are Nicholas Felton's annual reports.

6
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:13,060
>> Mm.

7
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,372
>> They're super beautiful.

8
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:18,330
And, you know, I guess you could argue about their objectivity.

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,590
But they're, they're very much personal, extremely personal information.

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,470
They're just personal, they're personal annual reports.

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,160
So, hard to describe them.

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,310
But if you go look at them you'll, you'll see what I mean.

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,020
I think in that vein,

14
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,800
there's been a lot more kind of personal data reporting, which is interesting.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,930
He sort of set the standard with these annual reports.

16
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,994
But, there are more and more people doing kind of personal data tracking.

17
00:00:44,994 --> 00:00:48,270
And then doing interesting visual things with that data.

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,500
So there's a new project, I'm going to forget the guy's name who made it,

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,700
but I think the website is aprilzero.com.

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,550
And it's this really, really in-depth sort of personal data reporting platform.

21
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,209
And the interface is really beautiful.

22
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:08,070
I'm not sure what I can kind of learn from it.

23
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,850
But just aesthetically, it's like quite stunning.

24
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,586
And you can see you know, his, his travel information.

25
00:01:13,586 --> 00:01:17,715
And sort of, how much he's working and what his calendar schedule is.

26
00:01:17,715 --> 00:01:20,520
And I think you see he has, you know, Fitbit, or

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,951
whatever these different like, wearable technologies.

28
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:30,460
And so those pieces of information are reporting in there too.

29
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,030
I think, you know, it's really interesting, this kind of stuff.

30
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,615
because it, it's not, I don't know if that makes it subjective or objective.

31
00:01:37,615 --> 00:01:40,360
But it's, it's very personal.

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,150
So in that sense, it's sort of just taking the view of that one,

33
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,600
that one person or that one experience
