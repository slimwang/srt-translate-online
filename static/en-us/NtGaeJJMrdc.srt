1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,930
These two rules here form what is known more formally as the Collatz series

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:10,410
named after the German mathematician Lothar Collatz and appeared somewhat erratic

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,110
as I think you've seen with the program.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,440
Sometimes it will terminate very quickly for certain values of i

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,240
and sometimes actually it will behave super eratic and it will go up and down and up and down

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,040
until it finally terminates.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,620
Now here's the thing, it has been conjectured that this algorithm here will terminate

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,640
for any value of i but so far nobody has been able to prove that.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,550
So if we were given an integer for this function here for which the Collatz hypothesis

10
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,390
that this algorithm here always terminates has not been verified

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,630
then that would indeed be undecidable.

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,930
Now truth be told, it would have to be a very large integer because the Collatz hypothesis

13
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,110
has been verified for large numbers indeed.

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:55,060
Nevertheless, once the integer is out of this range, we have no way of deciding

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,100
whether this algorithm would terminate or not.

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,790
The only thing we can do is run it so the Collatz problem or the Collatz hypothesis

17
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,720
is an open mathematical problem and of course as you know it's not the only

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,490
open mathematical problem so we could have other mathematical problems as well.

19
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,000
But I want to show you something.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,750
So if we have an algorithm that solves the halting problem, so if we indeed had this algorithm halt

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:22,840
what we could then do for example is write the following program for i = 1 to 10¹⁰⁰

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,070
then run the Collatz rules for i so we start with i = 1 then we go to i = 2 and so on

23
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,210
and then we feed this problem into the halting algorithm.

24
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:37,220
And now if the halting algorithm says yes, then this means that the Collatz hypothesis is true

25
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:43,110
for any number from 1 to 10¹⁰⁰ and if it says no then it means that there is some number

26
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,260
for which the Collatz hypothesis is not true, which means that this part here

27
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,850
would go into an infinite loop and then we can easily

28
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,360
check this for larger and larger and larger numbers.

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,000
An algorithm that would be able to solve the halting problem

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,570
would actually be able to solve almost any open mathematical problem there is out there.

31
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,350
Any mathematical problem that can be formulated as an algorithm

32
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,470
could be decided by an algorithm that solves the halting problem.

33
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:12,170
So this would almost be a kind of omission algorithm which also provides an intuition

34
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,830
why this halting algorithm here cannot possibly exist.

35
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,650
It would just simply be too powerful.

36
00:02:16,650 --> 99:59:59,999
It could answer almost any mathematical question that we can think of.
