00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,890
Okay, so here's a quiz for you Micheal, here's the

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,490
setup, you ready? You've got N data points. The learner

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,420
that you're going to use over your subsets is a

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,570
zeroth order polynomial. The way you're going to combine the

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,520
output of the learners is by averaging them. So, it's

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,320
just what we've been talking about so far, and your

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,920
subsets are going to be constructed in the following way. You

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,380
uniformly randomly picked them and you ended up with N different

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,160
subsets or disjoint, and each one has a single point

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,170
in it, that happens to be one of the data points.

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,620
>> Okay i think i get that

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,560
>> Right, so if you look over here on your left

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,800
you got a graph of some data points and this is

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,740
one subset This is another subset, that's another subset, that's another

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,650
subset, that's another subset, that's another

16
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,710
subset, that's another subset, got it.

17
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,490
>> Yeah, now what do you want to know about it.

18
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,490
>> Now what I want to know is when you do your

19
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,760
ensemble learning you learn all these different,

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,990
you learn all these different rules and then

21
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,510
you combine them ,what is the output going to be? What does the ensemble output?

22
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,640
>> And you want a number?

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,710
>> I want a description and if the answers a number that's a

24
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,240
perfectly fine description. But I'll give you a hint, it's a short description.

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,140
>> A short description of the answer. Okay, I'll think about it.

26
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,710
>> Alright.
