Here's the spreadsheet with the karma points per post. If we go to the bottom,

2
00:00:05,526 --> 00:00:10,821
you see that we have a sample of size 200. So in any of the white space we can

3
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:16,372
write equals average a 1 colon a 200. You should have gotten that your average

4
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:22,335
is about 12.96. If it rounded up to the nearest integer value then that's fine.
