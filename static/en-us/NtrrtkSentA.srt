Thanks Veto. 
And now it's time

2
00:00:01,984 --> 00:00:04,372
to install the Sunshine app 
on our phones.

3
00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:07,303
So to get started, 
let's grab a USB cable.

4
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:12,748
We'll plug in our device and then 
we'll need to enable USB debugging.

5
00:00:13,317 --> 00:00:15,986
This can be found in Developer options
in the Settings app.

6
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:20,066
But note that on Android 
devices 4.2 and above,

7
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:22,184
the option is actually hidden by default.

8
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,897
To find the secret menu,
go to the Settings app.

9
00:00:30,216 --> 00:00:31,988
Scroll down to About Phone.

10
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:34,816
Then go down to Build Number

11
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,613
and tap on that seven times.

12
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:43,071
Then, when you go back to Settings,

13
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:45,707
you'll see the Developer 
options menu appear.

14
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:49,279
Also, set up your computer 
to detect your device.

15
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:52,041
Check the instructor notes 
for more details.

16
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:54,515
We're going to continue 
using a device because it's faster

17
00:00:54,515 --> 00:00:58,345
and smoother for development. 
But if you don't have one, that's okay.

18
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:01,561
You can continue using the emulator 
that we created previously.
