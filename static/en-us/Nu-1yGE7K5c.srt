00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,980
We've talked a lot about marketing
goals throughout the course.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,570
Now these goals are really important,
but

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,300
they're not worth anything if all
you do is mention them in a slide.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,820
You need a way to follow them and

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,710
to ensure you're on track
with meatier goals.

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,020
>> You have to be honest and

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,390
find the most accurate metrics
to measure these goals.

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:17,920
>> You're looking for

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,050
something that is clear and that will
help you to evaluate your progress.

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,640
Think about your car dashboard.

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,802
The fuel gauge indicator turns on
the light to transfer the message.

12
00:00:26,802 --> 00:00:29,764
No more gas, soon enough,
you won't be able to keep driving.

13
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:32,788
You need metrics that are so
clear and relevant to your goal,

14
00:00:32,788 --> 00:00:37,160
that every event tells you something
about the health of your business.

15
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,120
>> Your metrics must
be measured correctly.

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,410
You don't want inaccurate or
incomplete data.

17
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,130
This could lead you down the wrong path.

18
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,550
It has to be simple, if it's too
complex to explain how to relate it

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,580
to your business and marketing,
then there's something wrong.

20
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,749
Let's look at our goals for
aBARKment that we created in lesson.two.
