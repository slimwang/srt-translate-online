1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,560
Doing this a little bit more formally, so we're going to represent our signal as

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,110
an infinite weighted sum of an infinite number of sinusoids.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,160
So the Fourier Transform, here it is,

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,100
in it's beautiful glory, in one dimension, okay.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,630
F of u is a Fourier transform.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,350
We just take the infinite integral of the original function times e to

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,620
the minus i 2 pi, u x.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,740
You might say, what?

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,296
Where did that e to the minus i, [SOUND] come from?

10
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:30,731
>> Where did that come from?

11
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:33,020
>> Oh, see, she didn't fall into that trap.

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,040
Well again, remember from your probably calculus class,

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,330
somewhere e to the i k is cosine k plus i sine k.

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,250
That's why this is the even part and that's the odd part.

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,860
This is where i is the square root of minus 1.

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,760
By the way, if there are any electrical engineers out there,

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,660
they have j as being the square root of minus 1.

18
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,640
I don't know why, because mathematicians use i,

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,630
I guess electrical engineers didn't like the mathematicians.

20
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,270
We're going to use i.

21
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,900
So what the Fourier transform does, is it converts from the spatial domain

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,510
into the frequency domain, and the frequency domain is either written as omega,

23
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,130
sometimes as u, as we're doing here,

24
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,710
sometimes even s when you're talking about loss transforms and stuff like that.

25
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:18,780
But the idea is that this cap f is the frequency spectrum, or I should say it's,

26
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,200
it's frequency of f of omega, but we're going to talk about its magnitude in

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,670
a minute, which is going to be sort of what we, we refer to as this spectrum.

28
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,970
Just for completeness, by the way, so here we had the Fourier transform.

29
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,330
This is the inverse Fourier transform.

30
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:37,530
Unsurprisingly, if you tell me what all of the sinusoids are,

31
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,250
if I sum them all up, okay, at some location x, and

32
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:47,440
I sum up over all the sinusoids, I can recover the original signal.

33
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,590
And that's called the inverse Fourier Transform.
