Hi, my name is Sebastian.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,900
I'm actually an entrepreneur,

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,070
and I'm super excited about
the Tech Entrepreneurship Manage Degree

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,590
because it teaches you how
to become an entrepreneur.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,410
Now what's great about an entrepreneur,
entrepreneurs change the world.

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,500
They dream, they reach for
the stars and then they make it happen.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,990
They understand how to
get the world to change,

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,980
how to make the world a better place.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,870
And being an entrepreneur
means you can do it yourself,

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,260
you have no boss just do it and
every mistake is your own mistake.

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,130
Now I haven't always
been an entrepreneur.

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,716
I used to be at Stanford teaching
as a computer science professor.

13
00:00:34,716 --> 00:00:36,796
I actually had tenure which
is a lifetime position, so

14
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:39,830
it was very comfortable at
a fantastic university.

15
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,280
And at some point I got a little bored
by all the security that I had and

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,310
figured I've gotta do
something bigger than that.

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,090
And then moved over to a search
engine company called Google.

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,710
And I started Google X,
self driving cars, Google Glass,

19
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,540
Project Loon, a whole bunch of projects.

20
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,550
And these are all crazy projects
that I could do at Google.

21
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,140
But in Udacity,
this is my biggest moonshot so

22
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,480
far, so
really trying to change the world.

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,334
Now I'm not here to tell
you about my company,

24
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:07,320
I'm here to tell you,
make your own company.

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,750
You can duplicate this.

26
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,100
If you take this Tech Entrepreneurship
Manage Degree, you learn the nuts and

27
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,870
bolts, how to be successful.

28
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,660
And your going to work many many
mistakes that I have to make because

29
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,500
none of this exist when I started.

30
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,810
The great thing about this not
a degree is that you're going to build

31
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,870
your own stuff.

32
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,482
You basically believe your own mini
company as part of your training which

33
00:01:26,482 --> 00:01:29,480
is you're going to build
the first version of your product.

34
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,620
You develop a monetization strategy,
you get your first users

35
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,260
of customers on board and we even teach
you how to pitch to potential investors.

36
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,934
All the stuff we do in real life,

37
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,614
now in your
Tech Entrepreneurship Manage Degree.

38
00:01:42,614 --> 00:01:46,550
So welcome to another degree and
I see you in class.
