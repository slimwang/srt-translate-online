00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:04,389
Hey Jessica.

2
00:00:04,389 --> 00:00:05,870
>> Hey Catherine.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,090
>> I got these sketches from Andre,
do you want to check them out?

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:08,590
>> Sure.

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,930
>> What do you think?

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,910
>> Wow, they look really good.

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:13,700
>> Yeah.

8
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,149
>> Man, so I'm liking all of them.

9
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,781
But maybe we shouldn't
use this first one here.

10
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:19,140
>> Why not?
>> Well, in Android,

11
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,216
we generally don't like
using splash screens,

12
00:00:21,216 --> 00:00:23,342
instead we jump directly
into the app content, so

13
00:00:23,342 --> 00:00:26,327
that the user doesn't have to wait for
the splash screen to load.

14
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:27,489
>> Okay, how did you know that?

15
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:29,329
>> Well, it's covered in
the material design guidelines.

16
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,439
>> Yeah, Canola and I totally
covered that in the last course.

17
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,615
The students know that
spec front to back.

18
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:39,430
But knowing the spec is different
from actually applying it.

19
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,430
So I think we could really
use some design help.

20
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,900
>> Actually I'm glad you bring that up.

21
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,360
So I know this amazing
team of designers.

22
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,520
So they can take our ideas,

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,330
the features that we like, and
create some beautiful mocks for us.

24
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,300
>> That sounds amazing.

25
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,640
>> Yeah, so how about I'll
take these sketches to them.

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,860
>> Okay.
>> I'll get some mocks back and

27
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,683
meet with you later.

28
00:00:55,683 --> 00:00:56,566
>> Okay, thanks.

29
00:00:56,566 --> 00:00:57,270
>> All right, see you soon.

30
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,470
>> So, when you first open the app,

31
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:04,849
we see a list of categories, numbers,
family members, colors, and phrases.

32
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:09,210
If you click on the numbers category,
it shows a list of numbers.

33
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,245
And for the number one,
we have the English and Miwok words,

34
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:17,953
as well as an image and a button to
play the Miwok pronunciation aloud.

35
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:22,520
And the same applies for the family,
colors, and phrases categories.

36
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,320
So phrases, such as what's your name and
how are you feeling,

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,020
don't really have an intuitive
image to go along with them.

38
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,480
As a result,
we decided to show the English and

39
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,770
Miwok translations with the option
to play the sound as well.
