00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:04,132
Turns out that the lifetime is larger than the half-life.

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:13,832
One way to see this is the following: Look at this part of the exponential decay, and now rotate it by 180 degrees

3
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:22,466
to get this curve. If our decay looked like that, the lifetime would be equal to the given half-life.

4
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:33,432
This and this average to the half-life. This and this average to the half-life, and this and this average to the half-life.

5
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:39,132
And so on. But you see, the exponential decay extends far more to the right.

6
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:48,667
Actually, it goes to infinity. Some particles live really long, and this pushes up the value of the lifetime in comparison to the half-life.
