1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,070
In fact the this, this notion that there
are three receptors that are absorbing

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:11,170
light, refer, results in what's referred
to as the tristimulus color theory.

3
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,000
The idea is that it's three inputs.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,800
And you know,

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,950
here it says the spectral-response
of each of the three types of cones.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,410
Unlike the previous one where we're
showing you the relative sensitivity of

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,050
each of them, what this graph is
showing you, just as it says, this is

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,150
the percentage of light absorbed by
each cone, actually by each cone type.

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,330
The reason that even though blue is so

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:39,430
much more sensitive down here,
because there's so few blue cones.

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,570
The amount of light down here absorbed
by the blue cones compare to the amount

12
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,700
absorbed by red cones and green cones is
approximately equal because there's so

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,570
many more green cones and
red cones than there are blue cones.

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,960
So the question then is,
is can we, how, it says can,

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,830
but how would we use the outputs of,
of these three types of receptors

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,080
in order to see color,
in particular like spectral color.

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,230
And what I mean by spectral color is,
you're all familiar with this red,

18
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,130
orange, yellow, green,
blue, indigo, violet.

19
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,380
You probably learned that somewhere
along the way as the colors in

20
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,950
the rainbow.

21
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,730
Well what it really is, is these
are different wavelengths of light.

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,650
And those are the colors that you see

23
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,220
when those wavelengths are put out,
okay?

24
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,570
And I'll, I'll, I'll, we'll,

25
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,007
we'll see a little bit more about
what we mean by that, all right?
