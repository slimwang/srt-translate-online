1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,180
As we mentioned multiple
times in this course,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,490
understanding the workload, in this
case, that will be the access pattern,

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,410
how the files are being accessed.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,260
This is an important piece of
information, that's useful when we're

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,520
trying to design and optimize
a particular solution in a certain way.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,620
When we're thinking about
how to design the system so

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,900
as to support a particular
file sharing semantics,

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,270
we need to understand things like
what is the sharing frequency,

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,100
what is the write frequency,
so what is the access pattern.

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,360
And also how important is it to
maintain a consistent view for

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,390
that particular type of files.

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,830
Once we understand these workload
properties, the design of the file

13
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:44,330
system must be done so
that it's optimized for the common case.

14
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,690
One issues, however, that file systems
have two different types of files,

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,428
regular files and directories.

16
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:55,150
In these two types of files, we often
have very different access patterns in

17
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,670
terms of what is the locality,
what is the lifetime of the files,

18
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,390
the size distribution,
how frequently are they accessed.

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,450
For these reasons,
it is not uncommon for

20
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,330
these two types of files
to be treated differently.

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,200
For instance, we can adopt one type of
semantics for the regular files and

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,440
another type of semantics for
the directories.

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,080
Or, if we use periodic
updates as a mechanism for

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,480
both, then we may choose to use
less frequent write-backs for

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,420
the regular files versus for
the directories.

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,410
This can be based on observations that,
for instance,

27
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,820
directories are more frequently shared,
than individual files in them.

28
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,230
Later in this lesson,
we will look at the choices,

29
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,920
how to treat these two
different types of files, for

30
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,710
the network file system manifest,
and the sprite file system.
