1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,320
So you've got a working prototype, and
you've gotten some feedback from others.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,000
Now all you have to do is
just keep plugging away at it

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,820
until all of the bugs are squashed and
your app doesn't crash at any point.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,210
You might even think at this point
you're ready to submit to the app store.

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:21,070
Sorry Charlies, it's actually time for
you to do more user testing.

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,570
See, at this point,
you're just too close to your app.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,299
I mean, you know exactly
how it's supposed to work.

8
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:30,696
And you also know how to
avoid any sticky situations,

9
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:34,400
however subconsciously
you might be doing it.

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,230
I mean, simply put,

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,588
you just can't be trusted to
reliably test your app anymore.

12
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:44,698
And now it's time for,
you guessed it, more user testing!

13
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:48,954
In addition to your classmates, it's
also a good idea to distribute your app

14
00:00:48,954 --> 00:00:51,443
to your family and
friends, or even better,

15
00:00:51,443 --> 00:00:56,100
a neutral third party who won't be
afraid to give you critical feedback.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,780
But, how do you get these apps to users?

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,290
Let's take a look.
