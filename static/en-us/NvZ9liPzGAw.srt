1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,199
So I think there's two things that are true here. The first one is polynomial time,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,632
because we're trying to do pre-processing for problems that normally require exponential time.

3
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:13,766
So if we don't have this requirement here, you could use pre-processing to already solve the problem,

4
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:18,966
because then you would have exponential time. And that really wouldn't make any sense.

5
00:00:18,967 --> 00:00:25,232
Of course, in practice it could make sense to have certain exponential time pre-processing algorithms where,

6
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,599
for example, the base of the exponent is much smaller than of the general algorithm.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,332
But actually I've never seen that done. And right now, for us, polynomial time is a good requirement to have.

8
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:40,699
Speeding up worse-case running time is, in my opinion, not a requirement for pre-processing.

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:46,466
Of course, you would like to get a speed-up, but on the other hand, as you've seen, the pre-processing rules are very simple.

10
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:50,899
So, we might always encounter instances where pre-processing does not apply.

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,766
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't do it. Pre-processing runs in polynomial time, so it's easy to do.

12
00:00:55,767 --> 00:01:00,332
So we should just hope that pre-processing helps us, but not make it a requirement.

13
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:06,599
And finally, that is of course very important. Pre-processing must not affect the solution that we get in the end.

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,132
If we have a decision problem where the answer is yes or no, after pre-processing, we want the answer to be the same, of course.

15
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:18,966
And the same is for optimization problems. If the answer is 10, 11 or 12, then after pre-processing,

16
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:25,099
the answer should remain 10, 11 or 12. Because otherwise, pre-processing would actually alter the problem,

17
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,667
and it would alter the solution to that problem, which of course is something we do not want.
