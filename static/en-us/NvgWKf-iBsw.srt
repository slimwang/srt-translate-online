1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,410
At this point in the class, you've learned a lot about many of

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,189
the different moving pieces that might go into a machine learning analysis.

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,840
And I think it's worth taking a step back and explicitly talking about where you

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,184
want to use your training data and where you want to be using your testing data,

5
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:19,550
because this can be a little bit confusing sometimes.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,650
Suppose that your overall analysis flow looked something like this.

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,420
You start off by splitting your overall data into training and testing sets.

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:34,140
Then the next thing that you want to do is apply PCA, so a feature transform.

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,990
And then you want to take a few of your leading principle components and

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,090
put them into an SVM, a classification algorithm.

11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,340
Remember that PCA itself can have a few different commands that you

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,590
might call on it.

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,000
So you can call fit on your PCA,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,060
which actually finds the principal components of your data.

15
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,020
But then you also have to call pca.transform.

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,690
Which uses this fit that it's found to actually transform the data

17
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,170
into the new principal components representation.

18
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,150
Likewise, a support vector machine or

19
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,270
a support vector classifier can be fit on some of the data and

20
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,630
then be used to make predictions on a different set of data.

21
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,410
So let's suppose that coming out of the training testing split,

22
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,050
we have two different sets of features.

23
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,190
We're only going to look at the features in this quiz.

24
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,210
We have what's called training features and test features.

25
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,170
The first thing you want to do is apply principal components.

26
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,800
Specifically, you want to find the principal components using the fit command.

27
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,190
Do you want to apply the pca.fit to the training features or

28
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,320
to the testing features?
