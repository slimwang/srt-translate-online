1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,680
Being able to reach out to your
developers is an invaluable asset to

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,620
having a popular API.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,150
Having blogs and forums allow back and
forth communications between client side

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,380
and server side developers, creating
a community around your product.

5
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:18,641
Publishing content via social media and
having code available on GitHub is also

6
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:21,415
a great way to accumulate followers and
evangelists for your product.

7
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:25,815
And even when things go wrong,
developers respect a company

8
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:29,545
that doesn't go into hiding, but rather,
openly communicates major bugs and

9
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:33,155
outages, so that they can
respond quickly and accordingly.

10
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:36,950
So, as you're making your own APIs,
make sure there's still a component for

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,480
human communication in order
to better support your users.
