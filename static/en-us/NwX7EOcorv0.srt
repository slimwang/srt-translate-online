1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,420
All right, let's recap what happened.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,900
You borrowed 100 shares from Joe, so

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,870
that's indicated by this
sort of empty box here.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,130
You sold those 100 shares to Lisa.

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:15,350
So now you have $10,000 in your account,
but you still owe Joe those 100 shares.

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,620
Let's suppose that since that time,
IBM has dropped in price and

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,830
now it's selling at $90.

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,200
You can make a profit from that,
and you want to go ahead and exit.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,550
So you approach Lisa and say, hey,
can I buy those 100 shares back?

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,460
And she says, no, I want to keep IBM.

11
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,110
Well, that's a little bit of a problem,
but fortunately, there's lots of people

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,880
who have shares of IBM and
would be willing to sell them to you.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,180
So Lisa's now out of the picture and
not part of this transaction anymore.

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,290
But, there is somebody else out there,
Nate, who's got a hundred shares and

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,230
he's willing to sell them.

16
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,110
So you buy a hundred shares from
Nate and give them back to Joe.

17
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,180
So your obligation to Joe,
is now completed.

18
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,477
IBM was selling at $90 so
you had to give Joe $9000.

19
00:01:05,477 --> 00:01:08,161
But remember you had $10000, so

20
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:13,455
the net result after everything is
said and done is you've got a $1000.

21
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:16,710
And you don't have any
obligation any longer to Joe.

22
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,598
So that's how short selling works.

23
00:01:19,598 --> 00:01:25,450
Now I personalized this story by talking
about Joe and Lisa and Nate and so on.

24
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,640
In reality you don't have to make these
personal agreements with any of these

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,990
people, your broker
makes all that happen.

26
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,820
Your broker is sitting here in
between all those actors and

27
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,340
making all this happen for you.

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,300
Well this all sounds wonderful
doesn't it, what can go wrong?
