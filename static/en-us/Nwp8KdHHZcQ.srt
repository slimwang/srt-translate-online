1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,930
So we're working with the decision version of vertex cover here.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:09,450
So as an input, we're giving a graph G with n vertices and an integer k.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:17,010
And the output is "yes" if G has a vertex cover of size at most k and "no" otherwise.

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,030
So the first time you see this kind of use of the if-better function

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,490
it might still seem a bit strange to you so I'm going to explain to you what it does

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,890
and how we're using it here.

7
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:33,970
We're using this if-better function to guess for us which vertices to put into the vertex cover

8
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,800
and which vertices we can leave out.

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,170
Then we check if the assignment is valid although actually we wouldn't have to do that

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:46,420
but I'll get into that in a minute and if the size of the assignment that we have found is at most k

11
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:52,940
we say "yes, the graph has a vertex cover of size at most k and no otherwise."

12
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,510
So as you can see, we're putting a lot of trust into this part here of the function

13
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:06,680
because we're basically trusting the if-better to tell us correctly whether we should

14
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,130
put a vertex into the vertex cover or whether we shouldn't do that.

15
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,830
And that is why I basically said that the computer that has this function available

16
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,730
is extremely powerful because if you can trust the if-better to do exactly what we want for us

17
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:24,590
which is guess the best possible assignment then of course this significantly changes

18
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,490
the running time of the algorithm here.

19
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,450
So let's do a little quiz--what is the running time of this algorithm here for a graph with n vertices

20
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:36,480
if we can trust the if-better function to perform as specified and guess the best possible assignment

21
00:01:36,480 --> 99:59:59,999
of 0s and 1s to the vertices.
