00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,390
Now to play audio, we have to go beyond UIKit and

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,880
think about another framework called AVFoundation.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,710
Let me bring that out.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,703
AV stands for Audio Visual.

5
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:15,346
And there is a library inside this framework,

6
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:17,910
that we will use to play this audio.

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,980
>> My mom always said, life was like a box of chocolate.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,820
>> So what I have done here, is I've added links to the instructor notes

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,550
that will list out all the classes that are inside AV Foundation.

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,418
We are going to use one of them to play the audio you just heard.

11
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:38,890
Your job is to figure out which class we should use to play audio from a file.

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,840
So go ahead and read the documentation, and

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,630
then type in the name of the class that can help us play audio from a file.
