1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,550
Moving upstream, the boat would go at x minus 5 miles per hour, and moving

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:08,745
downstream, the boat would travel at x plus 5 miles per hour. Great thinking

3
00:00:08,745 --> 00:00:12,526
for finding these two. Now, this one was pretty tough, so don't worry if you

4
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:17,010
didn't get it right. The key lies in the speed of the current. We know the

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,436
speed is five miles per hour. So, if the boat travels at x miles per hour, then

6
00:00:21,436 --> 00:00:25,404
with the current, it can go five miles per hour faster, that would be moving

7
00:00:25,404 --> 00:00:30,799
downstream. But against the current, we know the boat travels slower, so it

8
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:35,850
would lose the five miles per hour, since it's working against the current.
