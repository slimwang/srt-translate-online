1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,560
So to update all the buttons we first simply select the years button container.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,380
Again, which is the parent div that we attached a class to.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,930
And then select all the divs contained within our years buttons div, which

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,980
corresponds to each individual button, which we can then add our styling to.

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,930
And once we've selected all the individual buttons,

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,220
again, a select all should return 20 buttons.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,509
We make a smooth transition using D3's animation functions and then

8
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:37,620
set the initial stylings on the buttons that they have before they're clicked.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,690
And since we're adding this code before we update the button that

10
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,020
is actually clicked.

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,680
We don't have to worry, about having the clicked button, not be updated.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,780
So first we change all the buttons back including the button that was

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,720
clicked back to their initial styles and then once everything's reset, we can go

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,540
back and find the button that was clicked, and only update that single button.

15
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,599
So as you can see here, we've refreshed the page,

16
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,990
we have our map which represents the state of the World Cup in 2014.

17
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,530
And we have our buttons.

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,310
Now let's see what happens when you click and individual button.

19
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,050
As happen before the map has correctly updated and

20
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,710
the buttons color has correctly changed.

21
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,600
Now let's see if our updates to the buttons,

22
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,440
which shouldn't be clicked has worked.

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,320
As you can see here the previous button we clicked.

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,970
Has gone back to its initial styling.

25
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,250
The map is updated.

26
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,020
And the current click button has changed to blue.

27
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,980
And again, going to 1930, we can see this transition happen smoothly.

28
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,920
And everything seems to be working.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,660
Now that's the end of the LiveCode example.

30
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,870
And everything we'll be covering in this course.

31
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,840
But don't feel like this is the limit of what we could do with a map or

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,230
D3 in general.

33
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:00,020
I want to just recap what we did in this lesson since we did a lot of coding.

34
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,140
And hopefully I've inspired you to go out and

35
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,100
create your own visualization or adapt what we've created in this course.
