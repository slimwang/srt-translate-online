[Norvig] This homework assignment has to do with games that have more than 5 cards.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So in games like 7-Card Stud or Texas Hold 'em, players have more than 5 cards.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Sometimes some of those cards are in common--

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that is, all players share some of the cards. But that doesn't matter.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What you're asked to write in this program is this function best_hand,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
which takes a hand with 7 cards in it and returns the best 5 card hand.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So in other words, each player out of their 7 cards has to come up with

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
the best hand that they can make according to the hand_rank.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What I want you to do is write your code for the function best_hand

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to return a 5 card hand that's the highest ranked.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And here are some tests.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'll give you a hint, which is a lot of the functionality can be found

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
in the preexisting Python modules.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
One thing that's interesting to look at is the itertools module.
