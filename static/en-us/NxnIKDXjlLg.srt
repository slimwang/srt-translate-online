1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well, the first one is in some sense the identity transformation.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We're not actually doing any work here.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For everything in 1, 2, 3, just put that in the output.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That will totally work.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here we're going to take 0, 1, 2, but we're going to add 1 to each,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
so 0 + 1 is 1, 1 + 1 is 2, 2 + 1 is 3.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That will give us the output we expect.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Here we're going to do the reverse and subtract.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This will be -1, 0, 1.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's not what we were hoping for.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Here we're going to divide a bit. 3 divided by 2 is 1.5.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's kind of close, but 6 divided by 2 is 3.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is not getting us the answer we want in the right order.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And finally, over here, length of a is 1.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
My is 2 and the is 3, so we get the answers we expect.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Here I've written those answers out explicitly in Python in the interpreter,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and we're just going to check and see that we got the answers that we expected.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3. That's good.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This was much too low.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Here the division didn't work out properly, but in the last one it worked out fine.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We could totally fix this last one.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If we divide by 3 instead, we will get 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, but it was off by 1.
