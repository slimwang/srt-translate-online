1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Search engines are really useful.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
To use them to solve problems like this, we need to know more about to search for.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We'll try searching for union and well, we get a lot of stuff that's not very useful.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We can see that the Philadelphia Union lost its last game.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We can learn about credit unions and Union College--that's not going to work very well.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We could try the same search on a different search engine, put DuckDuckGo,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and it's a little more helpful maybe.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It does give us computer science as one of the choices for unions but what it gives us under that

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
is not too helpful for what we're looking for.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We could also try my personal favorite search engine--Search With PETER.info,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and if we search there let's see what we find--world domination plans,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and then we find the discussions on the Udacity forum about this very question.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is kind of an unusual result and probably not what we should normally be doing.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What we really should be doing is thinking of better things to search for.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Instead of searching for union, let's add Python to our search.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let's search for Python in union and now we start already to get very interesting results.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We didn't need to think too hard about what to search for.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Searching for Python and the thing we want to do on Python actually turns out

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
quite a lot of useful information, and we can see the second hit here

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
is actually doing exactly what we want or something very close to it--

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
it's how to find the intersection in union of two list in Python, and if we cook on that,

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
we can see some code and it actually has code for doing union.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
One thing we might do would just be to copy that code and I'm going to discourage you

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
from doing that but let's try that first.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We found this code and this doesn't do quite what we wanted in the question

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
but what I'm going to ask you to do for the quiz is to take this code

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and turn it into something that does what you want.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let's assume that you did this--you search for how to union two list in Python

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and you came up with this code and let's assume that if you have only taken CS101

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
that there's lots of things in here that might be a little strange to you--having this string here.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We haven't used docstrings in CS101, so that looks a little strange.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We haven't seen sets and we've seen lists but we haven't seen anything quite like this.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
There's a lot of mysterious stuff in this code, but let's assume it does what is says it does

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and your question is--could you use this to solve the original problem.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Your goal is to implement a union function that behaves as specified in the original question--

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
which is that modifies the first input to become the union.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So after calling union passing in a and b, instead of getting a result which is the union of the two list

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
as this code does, what you want to do is modify the value of a to contain the union of a and b.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And I should add a note here that says it's a pretty silly thing to do, but see if you can do it anyway.
