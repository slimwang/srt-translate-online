1
00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:05,730
All right, now comes something cool, again a little bit complicated.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,340
We know that p prime is on the epipolar line,

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,010
corresponding to p in the other image, Okay.

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,290
That's what this equation says.

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,786
If, if, if this equation holds.

6
00:00:15,786 --> 00:00:22,430
But suppose p prime was on the epipolar line,.

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:27,670
In the prime image for every point, P, in the original image.

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,080
You might say, well, how could that be?

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,549
>> How could that be?

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,530
>> Thank you, Megan.

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:40,850
Well the way that could be is, suppose Fp' equals zero.

12
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,030
Well, in order for a point to be on every epipolar line well

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,130
there is only one point that's on every epipolar line.

14
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,370
That's the epi pole.

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,090
So the way you find the epipole given the fundamental matrix.

16
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,780
Is you solve this equation.

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,240
And remember this two epipoles.

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,640
There's the epipole in the original frame and the epipole in the prime frame.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,250
And so you just solve each of those equations.

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,460
Fp prime equals zero.

21
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,870
Or F transpose p equals zero.

22
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:14,540
And that identifies for you the epipoles in the image.

23
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,080
So this F matrix is very powerful.

24
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,450
It tells you everything you need to know or almost everything you need to know.

25
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,190
About the way the points relate to another other in terms of

26
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,850
their projective geometry, and

27
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:29,100
that lets you do things like find the epipolar lines and the epipoles.

28
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,600
Pretty cool.
