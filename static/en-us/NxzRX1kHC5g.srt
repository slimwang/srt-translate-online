1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,705
So the third part that we now want to look at is ISO, which is sensitivity.

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:09,030
So we've looked at, for example, how we can control the aperture and

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,289
the shutter speed.

4
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:13,770
But now we also need to also count for the fact that we have another part of

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,930
the triangle which is, how sensitive is my film?

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,100
Now, this is dependent on a concept that has,

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,940
has been done with films a lot before.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,468
And when you had actually picked up a film yourself,

9
00:00:24,468 --> 00:00:26,829
you may have seen it has numbers like ISO 100.

10
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:28,780
Here I'm just showing you two examples.

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,357
ISO 100, ISO 1600.

12
00:00:31,357 --> 00:00:34,260
So this is an actually an important parameter on how we

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,370
get the right exposure of an image that we're looking for.

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,990
Film, a concept that started while film was how sensitive is the film?

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,110
Now, it really depended.

16
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,940
The sensitivity of the film really depended on the chemicals that

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,100
were put on it.

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,930
That is, how much light sensitive is the film, and of course,

19
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,660
to achieve, that you would have to put more chemicals.

20
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,700
Just by the limitations of how much chemicals you could put on

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,629
a film grain would result in basically how much granularity you would have.

22
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,440
because you really can't put in a lot of light sensitive chemicals on a film

23
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,000
with restrictions on, you know, the density of the film and

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,010
all that kind of stuff.

25
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,720
When we look at film,

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,440
we'll talk a little bit about that in the next sub-lecture.

27
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,400
In case of digital, basically it comes out to is,

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,260
what is the sensitivity of the sensor itself.

29
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,220
Again, when we look at sensors, we'll discuss this a little bit more carefully.

30
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,836
But here, basically, the bottom line is, the sensor sensitivity is can be

31
00:01:30,836 --> 00:01:34,690
now replicated by a number equivalent to the ISO.

32
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,110
Just as a important point to note,

33
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,610
the relationship between different ISO values is linear.

34
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,980
A 200 ISO needs half the light of a 100 ISO.

35
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,660
So this one actually would take lots of nature lights, but

36
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,820
1600 would be something I can use indoor without a lot of light.

37
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,630
Just to show you the details of this kind of stuff.

38
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,242
Here you can see the images of the ISO zoomed in, ISO 100 zoomed in.

39
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:05,842
And this is ISO 1,600 zoomed in.

40
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:09,389
And here you might be able to see a lot of noise in

41
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,947
the two different colors of yellow and green.

42
00:02:12,947 --> 00:02:16,281
And the boundaries should also be a little bit blurred, because again,

43
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:18,361
more chemicals have been put into this film,

44
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:21,720
which basically means that there's mixing going on a little bit here.

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,640
These find is crisp.

46
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,640
Of course, ISO 1600 would be used something where there's low light conditions.

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,420
ISO 100 would be used when it's nice and sunny.

48
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,290
But, again, photographers play around with this depending on what

49
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:32,850
their needs are.
