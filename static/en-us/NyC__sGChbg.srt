1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,440
All right.
To introduce you to temporal

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,450
difference learning.

3
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,280
It helps to have a little bit of
context about reinforcement learning in

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,260
a more general way.

5
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,310
So we can see how
the different methods for

6
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,760
doing reinforcement
learning fit together.

7
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,790
>> Okay.

8
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,410
>> So, I'm going to think about
reinforcement learning this way.

9
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,040
Remember we talked about SARS,
the state-action-reward sequence.

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,160
So, I'm in a state.

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,760
I take an action.

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,550
I get a reward back.

13
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,410
I end up in a new state.

14
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,290
I take a new action.

15
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,000
I get a new reward.

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,570
And this just continues, so
I put a little Kleene star after it.

17
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,450
To indicate that this is some
sequence of state, action, rewards.

18
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,510
That's what comes as input to
a reinforcement learning algorithm.

19
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,740
And what the reinforcement learning
algorithm produces as output

20
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,450
is a policy.

21
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,540
>> Sure, that makes sense.

22
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,826
Hey, I got a quick notational
question for you though.

23
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:44,110
>> Sure.
>> Should that really be a Kleene star,

24
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,530
or should that be a plus?

25
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,620
Well I'm being a little bit
lax with notation here.

26
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,060
But I'm imagining that,

27
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,310
even if you give a reinforcement
learning algorithm no history at all.

28
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,330
It could still come out
with an initial policy.

29
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,040
>> Sure that makes sense.

30
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,970
In fact, I guess that's true for
every algorithm we've ever talked about.

31
00:00:58,970 --> 00:00:59,750
>> I think so.

32
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,980
I mean it could be just be a default
policy like in all states take whatever

33
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,340
the first action is.

34
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,950
But the fact of the matter is over time.

35
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,630
The interesting case is when we've
had some amount of history and

36
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,550
we're trying to map
that to some behavior.

37
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,700
>> Okay I'm on the same page.
