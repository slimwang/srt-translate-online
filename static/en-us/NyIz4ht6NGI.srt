1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go ahead and add the post() handler.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, so here we are in our editor,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and we've got our get handler, and this is what draws the form.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let's add the post version, and this will get called when we post to the URL,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which is what happens when we submit our form.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay,so I've added a post function that goes along with our get function,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and the post function will get called when we post to /, which is what our form does.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And upon a post, we will return back to the browser--

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the string--"Thanks! That's a totally valid day!"

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Alright, let's give that a shot in our browser.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Okay, so here we are in the browser. I've reloaded my page.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now I'm going to type in some submissions, and this isn't exactly a valid month, day, and year,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but let's click submit.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Our form says, "Thanks! That's a totally valid day!" which is nice of it to say,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
but our day isn't exactly valid, is it?
