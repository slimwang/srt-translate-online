00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,559
Well, this first one doesn't work. It's not really feasible, because your nails

2
00:00:05,571 --> 00:00:10,964
grow independent of how long your hand is. We also can't assert this second one.

3
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:16,521
We can't simply say that taller people have longer hands. In fact, if we look at

4
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:21,965
the data, these two people look like they have about the same height. But they

5
00:00:21,977 --> 00:00:27,815
have very different hand lengths, therefore we can't say with certainty that

6
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:33,580
taller people automatically have longer hands. There's just a trend in that

7
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:39,470
direction. Also if we look at this trend, we see that people that have about my

8
00:00:39,482 --> 00:00:45,789
hand length, which is 6.75. Tend to have heights around this area. Seven feet is

9
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:51,934
84 inches, which is way up here. Therefore, it's very unlikely that I'm taller

10
00:00:51,946 --> 00:00:58,318
than 7 feet. But I could be. Remember, this relationship shows a correlation,

11
00:00:58,443 --> 00:01:04,190
not a causation. therefore we can't draw this conclusion, however we can say

12
00:01:04,202 --> 00:01:08,615
with certainty that people who have longer hands tend to be taller
