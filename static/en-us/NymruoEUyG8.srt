00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,940
Now, addition and subtraction work really 
similarly.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:09,020
Here, I've given you two functions. 
We have f of x equals 2x cubed minus 2x squared.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:14,993
And g of x equals x cubed plus x squared. 
Now, for these two functions, can you

4
00:00:14,993 --> 00:00:19,000
tell me what we get if we add f of x to g 
of x?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,110
And then secondly, what happens if we 
say, f of x minus g of x.

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,149
Make sure that you simplify your answers 
as much as possible.
