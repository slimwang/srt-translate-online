00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,330
Before we start coding,

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:04,450
let's take a look at a simple
app that uses geofencing.

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,750
You can see it here and
it's very simple indeed.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,380
I've created a geofence for
the location that I'm in.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,350
This is a studio in Mountain View,
California.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,520
And I've created it with
a radius of a mile.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,180
I ran the application before I
drove into the studio today.

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,680
And then once I got within a mile of
the studio, a notification was fired.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,330
And you can see the notification
icon in the tray here.

10
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,710
And when I swipe it down,
it says I've entered UDACITY Studios, or

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,870
I've entered that geofence of UDACITY.

12
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,250
Now, were I to leave this
one mile radius on my way

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,510
back to my hotel tonight, I would see
a notification from me having left.

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,210
Now of course you don't have
to use your notification tray,

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,510
you could have your activity do anything
in response to the geofencing event.

16
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,330
The nice thing about using
the notification trays, now if I'm in my

17
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:55,950
general desktop for my Android tablet,
the notification is still there.

18
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,240
So, I was traveling and it showed that
I entered the geofence that I want, and

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,150
when I touch that,
it relaunches the application.

20
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,470
So we're going to see next how
to build this application and

21
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,950
how to use notifications within
a geofenced environment.
