1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,162
As before, we're just going to substitute four in for x in the original

2
00:00:05,162 --> 00:00:11,020
function. So we're going to end up with 4 squared with is just equal to 16. So

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:16,397
our input of four spits out an output of 16. And once again this creates a point

4
00:00:16,397 --> 00:00:20,536
for us that we can plot a 4 comma 16. This lies on the graph of f of x equals x

5
00:00:20,536 --> 00:00:25,002
squared. Which incidentally is a problem you know very well. So the way that the

6
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:29,913
graphs of these functions look hasn't changed at all. From when we used to write

7
00:00:29,913 --> 00:00:34,438
them with y's instead of f of x. So the graph of y equals x squared is exactly

8
00:00:34,438 --> 00:00:38,562
the same as the graph of f of x equals x squared. Writing with this notation

9
00:00:38,562 --> 00:00:42,718
just underscores the fact that this is a function. This has that special

10
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:47,816
property of having only one y value for every x value that we can plug in. And

11
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:53,486
it also shows that the vertical values on this graph are dependent, upon the

12
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,026
horizontal values.
