00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,327
All right, I'm now sharing a Googler
shopping list with Frank, Jenny,

2
00:00:04,327 --> 00:00:05,320
and Abe.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,000
The sharing feature is pretty slick.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,090
>> I'm glad you like it.

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,115
It certainly wasn't an easy
road to get to this point.

6
00:00:10,115 --> 00:00:12,970
Let's take a look at what we've
accomplished in the wire frames.

7
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,760
At the start of version 0.4, we added
some basic sorting functionality to make

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,790
it easier to find shopping lists.

9
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,760
>> This helped users
organize their lists.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,980
But what we really needed was sharing.

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,410
After some prophetic guidance,

12
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,820
we decided to go with a denormalized
data structure that would support

13
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,260
our need for
quick look ups of users' shopping lists.

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,340
This increased the amount
of data we were storing but

15
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,230
ultimately saved the users time.

16
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,735
>> Right, and after that data change,
you were able to make a sharing flow.

17
00:00:38,735 --> 00:00:41,660
Where users added other
users to a friends list, and

18
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,720
then turn sharing on and off.

19
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,770
>> Furthermore, we simplified this
flow by adding auto complete search

20
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,390
functionality when
typing in user emails.

21
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,350
>> Great work.

22
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,040
>> Great.

23
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,610
And now I'm off to do
some guerilla marketing.
