1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,065
We can have the restaurants.html and
menu.html pages public facing so

2
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:06,510
anyone can see the menus created.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,730
Then we could protect the new, edit and
delete pages for our restaurants and

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:11,810
menu items.

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,250
In order to keep users not logged in
from modifying the database entries
