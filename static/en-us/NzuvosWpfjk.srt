00:00:03,183 --> 00:00:06,623
Just like accents, different accents
if you go from the East Coast,

3
00:00:06,623 --> 00:00:10,800
there's an accent, a different way
of saying things to the West Coast.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:18,010
I think in different families,
the language could very quite a bit,

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,890
but I think in general, I mean just like
the Southern, the Central, the Northern,

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:27,750
and they are all very similar in their
pronunciations like I would say looty.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,810
And it's a sound with the tongue on
the back of the teeth with your T.

8
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,150
But there are three different ways
to pronounce the T in the language.

9
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,070
You can do a hard T, a soft T, or

10
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,089
an extended T, and depending on
how you pronounce it could vary.

11
00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:52,890
I think it would make sense for
the coastal Miwok region plains, lake,

12
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,669
any region of the Miwok to create their
own app, language app if the need is
