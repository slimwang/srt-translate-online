1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,280
So now that we have seen how the BTB and the BHT work together, let's do a BTB &

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,640
BHT QUIZ on that. Suppose we have the following program. This is

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,520
the address of the instruction. This is the

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,860
instruction itself. And these are the labels for

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,100
branches. So, what this program is doing is

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,000
it's moving 100 into R2; it's moving 0

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,330
into R1. And then as long as R1 and R2 are

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,930
different, it's going to continue here. Once R1 and R2 are the same, it's

9
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,972
going to jump to the Done label and exit this loop. In the loop, it's adding

10
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:45,189
R1 to R3 to form R4, uses that to load a value from that

11
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:50,295
address and then adds that R4 to R5, adds 1 to R1 and

12
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:57,970
then unconditionally branches back to this loop. So this is the loop. This

13
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,580
is where we exit from the loop. And this is the sort of initialization for the

14
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,928
loop. Suppose that we have a branch history table that has only 16 entries

15
00:01:07,928 --> 00:01:12,240
and makes perfect predictions about branches. Suppose

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,350
we also have a BTB with 4 entries.

17
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,139
Also makes perfect predictions. And as you can

18
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:20,676
see, all instructions are four bytes in size, and

19
00:01:20,676 --> 00:01:23,249
we know that. So the question for you is,

20
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,202
how many times do we access the BHT for

21
00:01:25,202 --> 00:01:29,148
each instruction? Right here, how many times we access

22
00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:32,920
the BHT with this address because we are fetching

23
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,431
this instruction? Here, how many times we access the

24
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:40,530
BHT with this address because we're fetching this instruction?

25
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,434
And so on. There are eight instructions here for each one of

26
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:46,060
them. We need to say how many times we access the BHT.
