00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,318
So first, our selective attention is when we're focusing on what the

2
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:06,914
professor's saying and ignoring when the room is cold or the person by us is

3
00:00:06,914 --> 00:00:12,504
smacking. Your inattentional blindness is when you didn't notice that there was

4
00:00:12,504 --> 00:00:16,158
a man outside doing interpretive dance and reciting a poem saying I love you

5
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:21,952
Tory, be mine, but everybody else in class noticed. Here, when you heard the

6
00:00:21,952 --> 00:00:25,917
people behind you talking about your favorite band, this was a cocktail party

7
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:30,526
effect. Given you're focusing on the essay, here again, we have selective

8
00:00:30,526 --> 00:00:34,888
attention. And finally, when you realize the girl you borrowed the pen from was

9
00:00:34,888 --> 00:00:38,192
no longer sitting next to you and it was now a guy that was sleeping on his

10
00:00:38,192 --> 00:00:41,931
desk. This was your change blindness.
