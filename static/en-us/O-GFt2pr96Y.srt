00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,936
So let's lose our coordinate grid and all of those right triangles. That's

2
00:00:03,936 --> 00:00:08,888
right, we've gone off the grid. We just have one piece of string centered at

3
00:00:08,888 --> 00:00:15,900
the origin, 0,0. And we have the end of the string at some point x comma y. We

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,100
know that if we were to rotate this piece of string anywhere, we would create a

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,165
circle by the position of the end of the string. So, what's that equation that

6
00:00:24,165 --> 00:00:29,885
we can write relating x and y, and the length of the string? If you think about

7
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:33,168
relating the horizontal distance and this vertical distance with the length of

8
00:00:33,168 --> 00:00:37,180
the string, I'm sure you can come up with the correct equation.
