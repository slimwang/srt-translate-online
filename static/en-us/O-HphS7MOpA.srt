The key to answering this is understanding to be an instance of a class or of

2
00:00:04,242 --> 00:00:08,140
one of its superclasses. The first one is true. Fussy is an instance of a

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,664
Discerning Bear. The second one is also true. It's an instance of bear because

4
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:17,140
Discerning Bear is a subclass of Bear, it is not an instance of Black Bear.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,642
There is no path between Discerning Bear and Black Bear. But it is an instance

6
00:00:21,642 --> 00:00:26,484
of object. And that's because Bear is also a subclass of object, even though we

7
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:31,294
didn't show that, we know that's true because all classes that we defined must

8
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:32,903
be subclasses of object.
