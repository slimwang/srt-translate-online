1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,699
So today we've talked about
one particular method for

2
00:00:02,699 --> 00:00:04,688
doing what's called
incremental concept learning.

3
00:00:04,688 --> 00:00:07,566
We started by talking about why we
need incremental concept learning.

4
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:10,900
We have instances in the world where we
encounter a limited number of examples.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,110
We need to discern a concept
based on those limited examples.

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,970
So we start by variablizing our current
understanding to arrive at a more

7
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,020
abstract notion of the concept.

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,880
Then based on new positive or negative
examples, we either generalize or

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,850
specialize our understanding.

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,540
We talked about a few heuristics for
doing this, like the forbid link or

11
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,990
require link heuristics.

12
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,265
That allow us to develop a better
concept based on new examples.

13
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:33,925
Next we'll talk about classification
where we leverage the concepts

14
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:36,125
that we developed through
incremental concept learning.

15
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,575
But we'll also revisit incremental
concept learning in some later lessons

16
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:41,555
as well such as through version spaces,
explanation based learning,

17
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:43,245
and learning by correcting mistakes.
