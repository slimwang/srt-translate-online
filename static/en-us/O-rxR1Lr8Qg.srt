Oh here, I'm going to try it.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,410
And it looks like we just get an error.

00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,090
CD, water, not a directory.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,038

5
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:14,090
If you tried to CD a file,
or cat a directory for

a harmless error message.

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,510
So the correct answer is that cd to
a file just shows an error message and

00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,530
doesn't do anything harmful.
