1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,150
The challenges here are similar in
many respects to those around EHRs.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,530
While efficiency may not
be quite as important,

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,290
usability is arguably even more
important and difficult to achieve.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,250
Patients, including the elderly
who may not have support at home,

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,310
must be able to use these technologies.

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,450
The technologies are obviously capable
of generating vast amounts of data for

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,300
millions of patients.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,490
No one has time to look at it all.

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,360
So analytic and visualization tools
that minimize false positives and

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,790
appropriately alert providers
are of critical importance.

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,570
This is an area where
machine learning and

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,950
other tools of artificial
intelligence are being applied.
