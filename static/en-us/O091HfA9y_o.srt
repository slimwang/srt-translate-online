1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,680
Now that we have everything set up the way we need,

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:08,390
open Chrome on your development machine and go to Chrome inspect. Make

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,070
sure the site you want to debug is open on your mobile

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,320
device and then connect your laptop to your mobile device via USB.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,100
Then confirm that you want to allow USB debugging.

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,090
Back in our development machine, we can see a list

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,000
of the attached devices and the Chrome tabs that are

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,320
open on the devices. You can even open other tabs.

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,110
We can also focus on specific tabs, you can reload them

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,980
And you can even close a tab.

11
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,300
The best part of course is that you can inspect the pages that

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,870
are running on your mobile device, from

13
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,419
your development machine let's take a look.

14
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,860
One of my favorite new features is the new screen cast

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,060
mode. This allows you to drive the experience on your mobile device

16
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,450
from your development machine. You can click on links, and see

17
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,230
them update simultaneously on the device. As well as on your desktop.

18
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,080
As you can see, you have all the familiar

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,820
features from the development tools available for mobile now.
