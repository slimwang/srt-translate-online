1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,011
If you look in
the GifEditorViewController in the

2
00:00:03,011 --> 00:00:07,568
Objective-C project you'll notice that
there's a property for a gifImageView.

3
00:00:07,568 --> 00:00:12,526
Go ahead and add this property in your
GifEditorViewController.swift file,

4
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:15,720
and connect it to
the gifImageView in Storyboard.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,967
We're also going to add
a property to hold the gifURL and

6
00:00:18,967 --> 00:00:22,830
that property will be
an optional of type NSURL.

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,060
We'll set it to nil for now.

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,180
Once you've got the gifURL set up,

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,820
we're going to want to add some
code to the method viewWillAppear.

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,920
This code will render
the gifURL as a gif.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,779
Kind of like we did in
the WelcomeViewController,

12
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:40,776
we'll make a GIF from the recording
by calling the method gifWithURL.

13
00:00:40,776 --> 00:00:45,060
And notice that gifWithURL
takes a string as a parameter.

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,639
So we'll need to use the absoluteString
property of our NSURL.

15
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:54,951
And then we'll load that
image into the gifImageView.

16
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:59,880
And, of course, let's not forget
to call super.viewWillAppear.

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,150
With these life cycle methods, we
always have to remember to call super.

18
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,469
Back in our
UIViewController+Record extension,

19
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:13,787
we'll instantiate an instance of
the GIF editor, add our GIF URL and

20
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:17,250
then push that on to
the navigation stack.

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,040
We're going to do all of that
in a method called displayGIF.

22
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,630
So first we instantiate our
GifEditorViewController,

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:31,130
pass it the gifURL and
then push it on to the navigation stack.

24
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,450
And, of course,
we'll want to call the method displayGIF

25
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,050
from the method convertVideoToGIF so
that we can pass it the gifURL

26
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,600
we just got from regift and
we won't forget to unwrap it.

27
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,890
We're also going to need to call this
convertVideoToGIF method somewhere,

28
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,460
we can do that up in
didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo.

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,590
Remember we were just saving
the video to the photo album,

30
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,900
instead we'll just
call convertVideoToGIF.

31
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,450
And now we'll run it.

32
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,490
So let's see how it looks.

33
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:11,630
Here comes the camera, there's my
video producer seeing how many malt

34
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:16,200
balls he can stuff in his mouth, the
camera dismisses and there's our GIF.
