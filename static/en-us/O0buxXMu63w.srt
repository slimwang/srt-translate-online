1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,840
Okay, again, C might be true, but it's false.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,160
No, C is true, but you get no credit.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,760
The answer is true, in this case, because it's division by a constant.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,340
All right, so in this case, if I'm dividing by Z, so if I sum up X plus

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:24,090
Y divided by the Z, it's the same thing as X divided by Z plus Y divided by Z.

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,260
Much later we're going to be doing perspective projection, and you're going to

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,750
end up having to normalize the X and Y values, by the Z value of a point.

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,860
And then the Z is actually going to be a component of the element.

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,710
And since that component can change, that's not going to be a linear operation.

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,500
But in general, division is a fine linear operation because the last time I

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,100
checked, dividing by two is the same as multiplying by point five, and

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,140
multiplication is a part of the linear operation.
