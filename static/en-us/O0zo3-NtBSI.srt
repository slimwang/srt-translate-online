1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,933
The researchers want all participants to believe that they're taking the

2
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:07,900
medication. This prevents participants from being biased concerning the

3
00:00:07,912 --> 00:00:11,706
effectiveness of the drug. If they all believe that they're taking the

4
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:16,043
medication, then we're controlling for this bias. Not letting the participants

5
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:20,346
know which treatment they received is called blinding. Researchers use these

6
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:24,751
techniques when they suspect that knowing which treatment you're receiving might

7
00:00:24,763 --> 00:00:28,818
influence your behavior. The inactive pill in this case is called a placebo.

8
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:33,146
Placebos are fake treatments so that the control group is unaware that they are

9
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:37,188
being treated differently. When I say they're treated differently, I mean

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,711
they're not receiving the medication The researcher's didn't tell the

11
00:00:41,723 --> 00:00:46,023
participants which pill they received, because of something called the placebo

12
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:50,242
effect. People who know they're taking a placebo, might subconsciously think

13
00:00:50,254 --> 00:00:54,545
that the placebo's not doing anything. And this will influence the results when

14
00:00:54,557 --> 00:00:59,221
they report how well they slept. Getting back to the quiz answers. This first

15
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:04,170
option is untrue. Researchers only use deception when they suspect that knowing

16
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:08,872
the actual intent of a study may influence the participants behavior. And in

17
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:13,395
that case information is kept hidden until the end of the study. These two

18
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,833
options are also not true. Participants in experiments need to provide their

19
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:21,910
informed consent before the research can expose them to any treatment. Letting

20
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:25,645
participants know that they may end up in the control group is part of the

21
00:01:25,657 --> 00:01:26,535
informed consent
