1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,140
So how are we going to
solve the aperture problem?

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,790
Well, look,
the basic idea is the same as before,

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,670
we have to impose some sort of
constraints, but this time we're

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:14,090
going to impose some local constraints
to get more equations per pixel.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,690
So for example, We talked about
maybe we'll assume that locally

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,670
right around this point,
the motion field is very smooth.

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,300
In fact how smooth do we want to assume?

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,300
How bout we assume that it's
actually the same value.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,270
That is over a window,

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,930
we're going to assume that u v
is the same value everywhere.

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:40,300
So if we were using, let's say a five
by five window, so there's 25 pixels,

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,200
if we were assuming that there
was one u v for all of these,

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,890
the uv for, let's say, the center pixel.

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,910
That would give us 25
equations per pixel.

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,390
And here they are so,
what we've got here is, here's our u and

16
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,140
v that we're assuming is
the u v of some center pixel.

17
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,830
And here we have 25 rows
of the derivative on x and

18
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,120
the derivative in y at
each of those 25 points.

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,090
And th, this, these are the gradients,
dotted with u v equals the negative,

20
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,250
and here is the temporal derivatives
at each of those points.

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,160
So I can write that as a d equals b,
where d is this

22
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,430
displacement vector u v and
b is just this 25 by 1 vector,

23
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,950
that is essentially the negative
of all the temporal derivatives.

24
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,370
Okay, so
we have this equation a d equals b and

25
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,910
it's got 25 equations and two unknowns.

26
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,770
All right, well, so
that's a little bit of a problem.

27
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,600
How do we solve a system when we
have more equations than unknowns?

28
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,500
Well We do our standard
least square solution.

29
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,580
When we have an equation like this,
we say,

30
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,530
well, we're going to minimize
the square difference, okay.

31
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,770
And they way you do that is by using
the standard pseudo uh,inverse method.

32
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,670
So we multiply a by a transpose.

33
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,856
And since a is 25 by 2,
a trans-flows is 2 by 25, so

34
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:09,348
a transpose is just a 2 by 2 and d is
a 2 by 1, and a transpose b is a 2 by 1,

35
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:13,730
and we end up with this
equation right here, okay?

36
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,520
And these have the terms written out.

37
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,220
And these sums are summed over
whatever the window is it

38
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,100
that you're summing over.

39
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,920
So it's five by five would be over
all those 25 pixels and over here,

40
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,890
you just have the product of the,
the sum of the product of the,

41
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,390
image gradient and
times the temporal gradient.

42
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,380
This is our, what we have to solve,
and by the way,

43
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,550
this technique was first profos,
proposed by Luke Scigotti way back in

44
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,340
the dark ages of computer vision, 1981,
which is not quite the dark, dark age.

45
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,930
It was the dawning of it.

46
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,930
The dark ages were in the 60s.

47
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,420
All right, we just did that.

48
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,490
We can solve our squares and
come up with a solution, but

49
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,490
lets understand exactly what
solving this means, okay.

50
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,360
So you remember the aperture problem,
right?

51
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,040
And so here it's drawn out.

52
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,190
That the idea is if I have
a gradient in some direction, and so

53
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,100
this is my little gradient there.

54
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,630
Right?
So

55
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:09,060
that any u v that's along this
line would be an acceptable u v.

56
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,000
That is any u v whose component in
the direction of the gradient would be

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,550
acceptable.

58
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,510
And that's what this says.

59
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,020
That there's a single equation for that.

60
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,550
And that's the equation
of a line in uv space.
