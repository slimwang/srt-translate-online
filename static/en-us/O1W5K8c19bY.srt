1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
So far, our units have focused on showing that problems are hard

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,010
or NP complete to be more precise.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,110
Actually, what I have very often observed in practice,

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,190
and even in scientific papers where the office did not have a

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,020
solid background in theoretical computer sciences is this.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,880
Once a problem is shown to be NP complete,

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,290
many people would just tend to give up or come up with some,

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,600
well honestly terrible algorithm that they've justified with.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,660
Well, the problem was NP complete,

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,760
and that is why we're now going to turn our attention

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,250
to count the measures against NP completeness.

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,260
So, this unit and the following units are your first aid kit to help you overcome NP completeness

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,090
or at least take a bit of the sting out of it

14
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,720
because imagine you find yourself in the situation like the four computer scientist

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,690
that we have gotten to know throughout this course like Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave.

16
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,970
Solving tough problems was part of their job.

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,470
Alice was solving vertex cover for telecommunications;

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:03,210
Bob was working in biotech developing new medicines, analyzing genes;

19
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,690
Carol was working in finance designing secure investments;

20
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:12,050
and Dave was working in logistics where he had to solve the shortest tool problem

21
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,810
and actually there are logistics companies who developed algorithms

22
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,880
with which they save millions everyday and also fuel.

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,180
So, those problems are practically relevant although they are NP complete.

24
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,340
So, when your company or your boss asked you to solve an NP complete problem,

25
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,850
what should you do--should you say, "I want another problem,"

26
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:37,120
should you make her or him take this course so that they finally understand NP completeness,

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,570
should you say "It's impossible to do that,"

28
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,460
should you say "It's proven impossible,"

29
00:01:42,460 --> 99:59:59,999
or should you say "It's proven difficult but we can try."
