00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,917
Anxiety disorders are closely tied to panic disorders. A panic disorder is

2
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:09,339
defined by frequent panic attacks and pervasive and persistent fear worry and

3
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:15,410
embarrassment about having panic attacks in the future. So the center of panics

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,382
disorders is the panic attack. Panic attacks involves sudden changes in body

5
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:25,503
and mind. Panic attacks are characterized by an overwhelming sense of impending

6
00:00:25,503 --> 00:00:30,193
doom, heart palpitations, trembling, sweating, shortness of breath, dizziness,

7
00:00:30,193 --> 00:00:36,765
intense dread, nausea and even a fear of death. These attacks are associated

8
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:42,217
with perceptions of threat. It can occur for a number of reasons. For example,

9
00:00:42,217 --> 00:00:46,170
fear of danger, inability to escape, fear of embarrassment or fear of a

10
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,450
specific category of objects. Panic attacks usually last for about ten minutes.

11
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,790
But sometimes can come and go over a period of an hour or more. Due to their

12
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,090
physiological effects, people undergoing a panic attack may believe they're

13
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,476
having a heart attack or going crazy. As you can imagine, this can be extremely

14
00:01:04,476 --> 00:01:09,110
frightening. If a person has a panic disorder, there is a preoccupation of

15
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:14,241
being worried about having a panic attack. And this puts a person in an anxious

16
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,958
mood, which increases the likelihood of more worrisome thoughts which can

17
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:23,784
trigger another panic attack. To receive a diagnosis of panic disorder, a panic

18
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:27,752
attack must be followed by at least a month of persistent worry over future

19
00:01:27,752 --> 00:01:31,976
attacks, along with the development of potentially maladaptive behaviors to

20
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:39,760
avoid attacks. Such as avoidance of putting oneself in an unfamiliar situation.

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,432
People with this disorder may tend to disengage themselves from activities that

22
00:01:43,432 --> 00:01:48,380
they once enjoyed for fear of experiencing panic attacks. For example, some

23
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,604
people go to the extreme of avoiding being out in public. And that brings us to

24
00:01:53,604 --> 00:01:58,677
our next disorder. Agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is a specific phobia involving a

25
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:03,986
fear of venturing into public places. Now, it's not that people are actually

26
00:02:03,986 --> 00:02:07,826
afraid of the public places. But rather, they're afraid of having a panic

27
00:02:07,826 --> 00:02:12,271
attack while they're out. In severe cases, people are unable to leave their

28
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:18,151
homes. Sometimes for years on end. About 22% of Americans have reported having

29
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:23,095
at least one panic attack. But this does not result in diagnosis of a panic

30
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:27,123
disorder. In addition to having the panic attack, a person also has to

31
00:02:27,123 --> 00:02:31,835
experience the dread and anxiety about having another Panic attack. For

32
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:35,299
example, I once had a panic attack. It was terrifying, and all of those

33
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:40,038
symptoms felt very real. It was when I was on an airplane one time. But I

34
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:43,262
haven't ever had a panic attack since that one flight, so just because I had

35
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:48,256
the one panic attack when I was flying, doesn't mean I have a panic disorder.

36
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:52,345
And on top of that it doesn't mean I'm even scared of flying anymore. With all

37
00:02:52,345 --> 00:02:56,570
the diagnostic criteria, it turns out that approximately 3.5% of people will

38
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:04,320
have a diagnosable panic disorder sometime in their life. And 43% of those

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,363
people who do have a panic disorder will develop agoraphobia. Now, let's go to

40
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:11,120
Greg with a little more about phobias.
