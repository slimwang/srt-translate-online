1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,020
All right, I've got my personal side
open, and it still looks awful.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,440
I'll go into dev tools and

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,040
then edit the head by right clicking
on it and then doing Edit as HTML.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,620
I set the name to viewport for the meta
tag and then I set the content to

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,324
equal to width equals device-width and
then set the initial-scale to 1.0.

6
00:00:20,324 --> 00:00:21,555
When I click off it.

7
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:22,360
Ta-da.

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,650
Look at that.

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,110
It looks right.

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,960
Now, my site actually fits
the view port available to it.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,740
So what's the take away from this quiz?

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,225
Don't forget to set the viewport.
