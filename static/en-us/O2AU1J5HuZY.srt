1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now let's look more closely on what's actually in a certificate,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and we can double click in our browser, depending on the browser.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You're either clicking on the key or clicking on the name, and we can see that

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
our certificate is telling us we're connected to google.com, and the connection is encrypted.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
When we look at more information, we can see more about the certificate,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and we can view the certificate.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's look at the details of the certificate, and we can see many things here.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We'll look at several of them. The first is the hierarchy.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We'll talk about that later. That's what give us confidence in the certificate.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's look more closely what's in the certificate,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and I've zoomed the window to make it easier to see.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The fields of the certificate are the contents, so you can see it's got a version.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's got an issuer. Issuer indicates who issued the certificate.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In this case, Thawte, which is now owned by VeriSign.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's got an expiration time.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's got the time it was valid from until the time it was valid to.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Then it has the subject, which gives us the name of the owner of the certificate,

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
which is google.com, and then we can see the public key information.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It says the algorithm of the public key is,

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
which is using RSA Encryption, and we talked about PKCS in unit 4

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's the way of padding to provide security when using RSA,

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and we can see the public key.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We can see the modulus is 1024 bits.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's long enough to be secure with the recommended RSA key sizes today,

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and then we can see the exponent, and we see that it's a small exponent.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This is a popular exponent. Many keys use this.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And we talked about, when we look at RSA,

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
that it's okay that the public key has a small exponent.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What we need is to know that the exponent for the secret key is hard to determine,

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
so that must be a large number, but the public key can have a small exponent.
