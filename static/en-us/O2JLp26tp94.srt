1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,050
So there's a cool way of thinking about image reprojection,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,180
sort of a natural geometry.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,310
The first is, think about take one picture, another picture, another picture and

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:14,210
you'll see here that all of these pictures were taken by rotating my camera.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,060
And I've drawn it as if my camera's center projection was perfectly aligned.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,820
Of course it's never perfectly, but pretty close.

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,750
Although you can buy little tripods that make it

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,860
easy to rotate the camera right above the focal point of the lens.

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:33,490
In fact, if if some of you have a really good camera it'll show you where

10
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:39,440
the film plane, or the sensor plane of of of the camera is.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,350
And then if you know the focal length of your camera, of your lens, sorry, you.

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,840
Let's suppose it's a 50 millimeter lens, you would measure 50 millimeters from

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,630
that point, and you know that's the focal point of my lens.

14
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,050
And you could set your tripod up so that the axis of rotation is

15
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,800
right underneath that, and that's how you'd actually do that rotation.

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,930
So anyway, so

17
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,370
we show here that we have three images taken from three different orientations.

18
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,550
Then, what we want is, we're going to project all of

19
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:11,170
these images onto some single mosaic projective plane.

20
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:11,710
All right?

21
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,550
So here we're showing projecting image one, projecting image two, and

22
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,690
projecting image three.

23
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,640
All right?

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,880
And you're, so the idea is that you're projecting everything down

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,880
onto a common plane.

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,450
And of course, there is some overlap.

27
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,460
Which is actually a good thing,

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,830
because in order to figure this out you're going to need overlap.

29
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,520
But of course you're also going to have to figure out a) how to

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,470
transform these images, and b) how to blend them.

31
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,510
So this is way of thinking of mosaics is that these are images that

32
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:45,820
are reprojected on a common plane, and the mosaic is formed on that plane.

33
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:51,440
Before we go further, this only works for sort of a limited field of view.

34
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,300
But you might be thinking to yourself, wait a minute,

35
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,510
can't I take pictures all day?

36
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,840
Spinning around on my tripod,

37
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,050
now you get to see how much hair I don't have on the back of my head.

38
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,890
I know you've always wondered about this.

39
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,480
Anyway, it feels like you should be able to paste together pictures going all

40
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,960
the way around.

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,500
And you can.

42
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,320
And in fact Photoshop and even little cameras that you buy do this for you.

43
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,560
They're not actually projecting it onto a plane.

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,820
They're projecting it onto some other surface like a cylinder.

45
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,020
And then you unwrap the cylinder.

46
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,160
And you get a panorama.

47
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,580
It turns out that's not actually a real picture.

48
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,940
It's sort of a, I mean it's a real picture, it's made up,

49
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,850
but, but it's not a particular scene.

50
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,210
Whereas when you do a panorama onto a plane,

51
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,210
it's as if you had a super wide field of view camera.

52
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,600
So it's, it's two different kinds of things.

53
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,850
But in the,

54
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,650
in the, when you do the really wide ones it maps it on to a cylinder.

55
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,700
So, how are we going to do this, all right?

56
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,190
So here's an example.

57
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,510
Again, courtesy of Steve Sikes.

58
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,850
So what we're going to do is, we're going to take these multiple pictures.

59
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,030
These are from the Great Wall of China.

60
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,290
Thank you Steve.

61
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,620
And, you know, what's drawn here is this idea that we've taken all of

62
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,780
these pictures from the same center of projection.

63
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,510
So, how do we do this?

64
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,690
Well, as we talked about before, the projection between two planes,

65
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,230
shown here as, P prime equals H P, is just a homography.

66
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,420
Remember that from last time?

67
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,920
A homography that allows us to map from one plane to the next.

68
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,280
In fact, a little bit later I'm going to show you a,

69
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,220
a nice little proof that says a mapping,

70
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,910
a projective mapping between any two planes can be represented as a homography.

71
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,690
But here we've represented it as just H going from one set of points to another.
