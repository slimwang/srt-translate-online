1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,960
We talked about discretionary access
control and mandatory access control.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,420
So here it says database access
control is managed centrally

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,060
by a few privileged users.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,010
We may have used the term
trusted users in the past.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,110
It's saying is this an example of
discretionary access control, DAC, or

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,520
mandatory access control, MAC?
