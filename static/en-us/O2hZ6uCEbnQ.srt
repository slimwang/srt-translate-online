00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:04,428
So let's try another one. If environment played little to no role and genetics

2
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:08,076
played a large role in personality formation, what pattern of results do you

3
00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:13,405
think we would see? We'd see similar personality styles between close relatives

4
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:18,616
regardless of where they grew up. We'd see similarity in personality between

5
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:22,852
only close relatives who were raised together. We'd seem similarity in

6
00:00:22,852 --> 00:00:27,230
personality between all relatives only if they were raised together. Or

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,060
finally, we'd see similarity in personality would increase as genetic closeness

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,659
increased.
