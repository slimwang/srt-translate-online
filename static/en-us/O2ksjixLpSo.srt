00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,238
It's true that three plus one is than or equal to four. It's also true that

2
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:08,834
three plus one is greater than or equal to four, but it's not true that three

3
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:17,290
plus one is not equal to four. These values are right on the boundary. We would

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,844
call this an edge case for this condtion. Its right at the edge of the values

5
00:00:21,844 --> 00:00:26,230
that make the condition true or false. When you're writing conditions its

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,874
really easy to make little slips. Especially for the values right on the edge

7
00:00:29,874 --> 00:00:35,630
of the range we want. Its wise to always test a couple of values like this.

8
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,382
That way if you miscategorize the case right on the edge you'll find out about

9
00:00:38,382 --> 00:00:43,058
it soon. And be able to fix it.
