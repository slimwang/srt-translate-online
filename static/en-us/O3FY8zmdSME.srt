1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Smoothing was the only planner that actually really worked in a continuous domain.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Everything else was very discrete.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Our breadth-first, A-star, and dynamic programming all find the optimal solution.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Dynamic programming is the only one that's universal,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and smoothing is the only local operation

6
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
whereas those over here all optimize a global planning problem.
