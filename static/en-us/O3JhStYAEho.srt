1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,719
So far all the features of the app have
been contained in a single screen on

2
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:06,109
a single activity.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,259
Splitting up information based
on the action your users want to

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:13,757
do makes your app easy for you to code
and for your users to understand.

5
00:00:13,757 --> 00:00:17,619
As we saw just a little while ago, when
an item is clicked in the Sunshine app,

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,530
the app shows a new activity
with the weather data.

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,870
So how do we start one
activity form another?

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,695
Well, instead of having an activity
call each other directly,

9
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:31,550
Android facilitates communication using
messaging objects called intents.

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,850
Intents let an app request
that an action take place.

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,254
That can be anything from starting
a new activity to picking or

12
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:42,061
displaying a photo from your phone
gallery, or making a phone call.

13
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:47,530
So why are we using intents rather than
just passing in the class name directly?

14
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,070
Well, intents are a little
more complicated than that.

15
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,170
I like to think of them as envelopes.

16
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,520
Each one includes who, or in this case
which, component you want to deliver to.

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,570
There's even room for
a small amount of data to be delivered,

18
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,280
packaged as extras which
are primitive topples.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,939
That can be read by the application
component that ultimately receives and

20
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:09,679
opens the intent.

21
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:12,829
So using this metaphor,

22
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:15,620
an explicit intent uses the name
of the target component
