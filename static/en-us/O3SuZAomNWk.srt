00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,460
So, this was a design mock given to me by a designer.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,990
The left pane here is just information on colors.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,730
So, you can just ignore it for now.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,120
Now, we just finished talking about boxes and boxes and

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,810
how fun it is to draw boxes around things.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,690
So, when you see a page like this, we need to start looking at it and think,

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,880
how do I draw a box around every visual element here, and then, how do I

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,759
do it until I'm down to a very simple element, like a single image or paragraph?

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,420
Well, the best way to learn how is to actually do it.

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,700
I'll get you started by drawing the first three.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,360
First, we'll have a box around this header here.

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,000
Now, inside this box, I see two other boxes.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,270
One around our image here, and another around our name and title over here.

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,950
Now it's your turn to draw the rest of the boxes around the remaining elements.

15
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,370
A link to the mock is included for you in instructor notes.

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,830
Now don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.

17
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,420
When you're done please let me know how you completed this task,

18
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,260
and how many boxes you ended up using to divide the page.

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,060
Now, when you boxify this design, and yes, that's a technical term, boxify,

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,220
did you save an image of the design and draw boxes with a graphics program?

21
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,090
Did you just draw the boxes separately on a piece of paper?

22
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,730
Did you print out the page and draw on it?

23
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:35,030
Or did you print out the page and cut it up with scissors?

24
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,100
And don't forget to let me know how many boxes you found on the page.
