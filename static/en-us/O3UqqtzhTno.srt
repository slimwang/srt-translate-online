1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,280
This is a multi-device world.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,330
Everyone uses their phone on the go.

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,450
>> And they probably sit down with
their laptops when they get home.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,719
>> People probably visit
the same sites on both, but

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,376
that doesn't mean that they've
got the same intention.

6
00:00:12,376 --> 00:00:13,335
Yeah.

7
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:16,446
While you may peruse your favorite
online retailer while you're on the go,

8
00:00:16,446 --> 00:00:18,683
you may not feel comfortable
taking out your wallet and

9
00:00:18,683 --> 00:00:21,270
typing in your payment
information in public.

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,360
Or maybe you just don't feel like
dealing with tiny little buttons and

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,010
you're in a big rush.

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,543
>> So you wait until you get home
to actually make the purchase.

13
00:00:28,543 --> 00:00:30,002
It's perfectly reasonable.

14
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:34,294
And developers who take advantage of
this pattern stand to convert even

15
00:00:34,294 --> 00:00:35,660
more users.

16
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,890
>> There are a few ways you could help
users start a form on one device and

17
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,570
then finish on another.

18
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,290
For instance,

19
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,720
you could offer them a way to share an
item through social channels or email.

20
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,120
Or there's an even simpler tactic,
save to a shopping cart.

21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,100
This lets users leave for
now without worrying.

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,790
Because they know when
they come back later,

23
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,930
their items will be waiting for them.
