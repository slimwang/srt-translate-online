00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,144
So, a negative x coordinate is to the left of the origin. And a negative y

00:00:04,144 --> 00:00:08,342
coordinate is below the origin. Can you match the following points to the

00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:12,964
appropriate places on the graph? Write the letter in the corresponding box. For

00:00:12,964 --> 00:00:17,503
example, if you think this point is letter c, you would write c in the box. Good

00:00:17,503 --> 00:00:17,853
luck.
