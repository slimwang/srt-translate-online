00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,495
This perfect square trinomial is really a binomial squared. Our a is really 3c,

2
00:00:05,495 --> 00:00:11,742
since the quantity 3c squared equals 9c squared. Our b term is really 2d. We

3
00:00:11,742 --> 00:00:17,140
know 2d squared equals 4d squared. So this is a perfect square trinomial. And we

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,905
can factor it as a minus b squared. So we have 3c minus 2d squared.
