1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's my solution: I break up this data to its components.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Then I hold if the pending score is greater than or equal to the x,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
or if I've already won

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
if my current score plus the pending score is already greater than or equal to the goal.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Otherwise, I return roll as my move.
