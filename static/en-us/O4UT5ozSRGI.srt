1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] The answer is a little bit involved.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We use total probability to re-express this by bringing in A.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
P of X3 given X1 is the sum of P of X3 given X1 and A

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
times P of A given X1 plus the A complement, which is X3, conditional X1 and not A

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
times P of not A given X1.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That is just total probability.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Next we utilized conditional independence by which we can simplify this expression

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to drop X1 in the conditional variables

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and we transform this expression by Bayes' rule again.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The same applies to the right side with not A replacing A.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All of those expressions over here can be found

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
either in the table up there or just by their complements,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
with the exception of P of X1.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But P of X1 can again be just obtained by total probability,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:11,000
which resolves to 0.2 times 0.5 plus 0.6 times 0.5,

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
which gives me 0.4.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We are now in a position to calculate the last term over here, which goes as follows.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This expression is 0.2 times 0.2 times 0.5 over 0.4 plus 0.6 times 0.6 times 0.5 over 0.4,

19
00:01:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which gives us as a final result 0.5.
