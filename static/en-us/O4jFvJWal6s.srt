1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:06,380
The right answer over here is 6.25 times age plus 0.

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,170
It's zero because we are.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,160
When age is zero,

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,060
the net worth is zero that means that we are crossing through the origin.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,899
And when you divide 500 by 80 you actually get 6.25.
