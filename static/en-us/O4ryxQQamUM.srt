1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,719
The idea of what you're looking for
in those initial employees,

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:08,650
is it's a really important one.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,780
They have to be jacks of all trades and
they have to be passionate but

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,610
they also and, in fact, I think this is
just when you're looking for employees

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,410
in any whether it's a start up, whether
they're your first employee or hundreds.

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,020
What you really want are people that
have a very specific skill, but

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,810
are willing, and
this is where the passion comes in,

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,570
are willing to do whatever it takes,
whether it's their job,

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,210
whether it's their specialty, whether
it's kind of outside their comfort zone.

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,180
Because if you think about a start up
the grows is going, the people that

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,650
start, their rules are going to change
every six months, significantly.

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,690
The first person that
handles marketing for

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,020
you could be your VP eng in a year and
a half.

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,290
You never know what's
going to happen and

15
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,100
you need the most adaptable
people you can find.

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,120
And I think that adaptability,
some of it's a core trait but

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,020
a lot of that is really
just willingness and

18
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,490
passion and an ability to learn fast
which is super important obviously.
