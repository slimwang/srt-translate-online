00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,728
Thanks, Lauren. We see that aggression is a part of our lives. However, on the

2
00:00:04,728 --> 00:00:09,943
bright side, we also see that as humans we engage in pro-social behavior. We

3
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:13,663
would like to start this part of the lesson by going back to the first lesson

4
00:00:13,663 --> 00:00:18,355
on what is psychology? Do you remember when we talked about Kitty Genovese?

5
00:00:18,355 --> 00:00:22,323
Recall that Kitty Genovese was walking home to her apartment after work late

6
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:27,147
one night. And a man attacked her outside of her apartment building, she

7
00:00:27,147 --> 00:00:32,729
screamed and people turned their lights on. Then the attacker ran away, however

8
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:38,619
nobody called the police. Next, the attacker returned and people heard more

9
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:44,395
screams, and still nobody called the police. And then in the end, he ended up

10
00:00:44,395 --> 00:00:49,279
killing Kitty. How is it that such a long drawn out murder can happen, and so

11
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:53,419
many people can hear the attack, and yet no one, well one person out of 38,

12
00:00:53,419 --> 00:01:00,150
even so much as calls the police? To answer this question, two researchers

13
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,434
Darley and Latane designed an experiment to study what they came to call the

14
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:11,105
Bystander Effect. Let's take a closer look at how this study was designed. The

15
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:14,680
researchers had participants who were talking to each other via headsets, it

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,310
turns out that the recordings were actually pre-recorded and the participant

17
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:24,037
was interacting with those pre-recorded conversations. In addition, the group

18
00:01:24,037 --> 00:01:28,782
sizes varied, some thought that they were alone with one other person, others

19
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:35,203
thought they were in larger groups. Next, some time during the conversation the

20
00:01:35,203 --> 00:01:40,443
participant heard someone choking. Now, remember this was pre-recorded but the

21
00:01:40,443 --> 00:01:45,690
participant did not know that. Now before we move forward with the results.

22
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,087
What would you do in that type of situation? You don't have to type an answer,

23
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:51,100
but think about it for a moment.
