1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,320
So now my goal is to start
thinking about how we going to

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,300
warp an image to a different size.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,820
This is a global transformation, or
a global warping, and to help us,

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,810
we will need to start looking at if we
can come up with a set of parameters

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,830
that on easy adjustment
of these parameters.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,830
We can basically take
a set of equations and

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,736
generate a new output
from a given input.

8
00:00:21,736 --> 00:00:25,380
So now we want to actually start looking
at how to get an output image G if

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,180
the F is given and we have a certain set
of parameters to do this transformation.

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,780
To help us, lets create just
a simple coordinate axis here.

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,500
Usually if you remember I always put
the coordinates axis going down in y and

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,170
x this way.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,870
Just for simplicity and consistency.

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,900
I'm going to start using
the traditional set of axis here.

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:48,620
Of course this would be the x-axis,
the y-axis, and this would be the (o,o).

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,290
All right?

17
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,800
Let's find another coordinate frame.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,830
And here, so
assuming this is again the (o,o) and

19
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,870
this is x and y, you notice this
image has been moved a little bit.

20
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,320
Let's claim that this
has been translated.

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,319
By tx, and ty.

22
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,940
The translation's in x and y.

23
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,460
So this in essence kind of says,
that now I've translated the image.

24
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,800
So this is basically, warping, or
transformation of translation.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,720
Another similar example would be when
I actually take the image, again,

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,510
the x and y axis,
that we've been paying attention to.

27
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,690
Origin except that now we notice.

28
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,930
This image has been rotated.

29
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,500
And if you draw this axis here,

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,860
you might say that this has
been rotated by amount theta.

31
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,230
And that's rotation actually now means
that basically the same pixel values

32
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:42,190
that I have here, now appear in a
different setup, and of course, thinking

33
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,510
hard about it, you might also thinking,
this is basically, change the way.

34
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,810
Rows and columns look, and
how my pixel values are looking.

35
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,430
So this is basically looking
at simple rotations.

36
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,400
Let's look at a few additional examples
of this kind of, parametric warping or

37
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,290
transformation of images.

38
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,170
Again, my input image.

39
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,840
In this one I've stretched the image.

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,380
Right.

41
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,860
In essence,
what I've done is I've scaled it.

42
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,008
I've added basic additional
dimension in the.

43
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,240
X axis then I have here,
y in this one is of course the same.

44
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,030
Result in of course my vit is larger and
in this case the height is the same.

45
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:22,030
This basically where we just
change one scale parameter is

46
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,010
the change of the aspect of the image,
and of course we could do this in both

47
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,590
directions x and y, and of course that's
the change in the scale of the image.

48
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,380
Very simple stuff so far.

49
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,890
Another example where
a basically have the same image.

50
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,690
So this time around if you
notice that we've actually done

51
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,500
an interesting thing.

52
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,340
What we've done here is,

53
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,140
we've added a little bit of
perspective projector warp.

54
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,610
Now the top row is much top numbers or
top part is much smaller.

55
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,220
Bottom is larger, and

56
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,030
in essence, the image seems to have
flipped on that side a little bit.

57
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,860
This is, referred to as Perspective,
and this, of course,

58
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,310
is an example where we have created
an affine deformation of the image,

59
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,350
where basically now, the image seems
to have, kind of have a lot more sheer.

60
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,930
Again different types of warps
are transformation applied

61
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,340
to the same pixel values.

62
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,530
And of course as you noticed the domain,
the number, how the x and

63
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:24,632
y's change depend on how,
what kind of function we could apply.

64
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:25,572
So let's now talk about what kind
of functions we could apply.
