00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,709
Now there was a very early time in my career where I learned a very valuable

2
00:00:02,709 --> 00:00:06,290
lesson. I had just finished up an internship with a great game studio called

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,770
Petroglyph Games and I was actually on an on site interview for a new company.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,794
I got into a light debate with someone during one of my interviews about what

5
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:17,557
things should be named. More specifically, we were describing what an object is

6
00:00:17,557 --> 00:00:21,463
that walks around in the world. Unfortunately, I probably got too deep on that

7
00:00:21,463 --> 00:00:24,518
conversation, and it turns out that I was actually arguing with the technical

8
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:29,335
director of the project over a naming convention. Needless to say, I didn't get

9
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:32,575
the job. The point was this, as game development goes on lots of people have

10
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:36,221
lots of different names for things. You just spend less time worrying about

11
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:40,050
what something called and more time worrying about what it does. Now pretty

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,810
much every game architecture out there is going to have some encompassing

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,570
object that has logic associated with it that may or may not have a visual

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,024
representation and may or may not actually be represented on the server. This

15
00:00:51,024 --> 00:00:55,284
is a basic object that every game has. You can call it an actor or an entity or

16
00:00:55,284 --> 00:00:59,031
a jabberwocky, for all it's concerned. Trust me. Worry less about the

17
00:00:59,031 --> 00:01:02,270
nomenclature of what things are called, you'll get more jobs that way.
