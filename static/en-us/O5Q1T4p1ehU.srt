00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,598
Now that we have a loaded image, we need to draw that image to the canvas via

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:09,436
the canvas.drawImage API. This function takes the image object itself as well

3
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:14,389
as the locations on the canvas that we'd like to draw that image. As you can

4
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:18,079
see, there are some other parameters that drawImage takes. Don't worry about

5
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:20,660
those just yet. For now you can leave those blank. By the way, if you are ever

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,715
interested in finding out more about an API for HTML5 development, make sure

7
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:28,765
you check out webplatform.org. It's a nifty little space where all your

8
00:00:28,777 --> 00:00:32,871
questions can be answered. For our next step, why don't you go ahead and fill in

9
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:35,890
the onLoad function that we defined earlier. So that rather than logging a

10
00:00:35,905 --> 00:00:41,473
message to the console, instead, it draws the image at pixel location 192 by 192.
