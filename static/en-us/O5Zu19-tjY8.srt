Hi, students. I am back to teach you a bit about SLAM.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There was a request--a popular request, actually, in email and the discussion forum.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
SLAM is a method for mapping that's short for "simultaneous localization and mapping."

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Some of the this might show up in the final exam, so do pay attention.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Mapping is all about building maps of the environment.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You might remember in the localization classes we assumed the map was given.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
One of the big passions in my life has been to understand how to make a robot

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
make these maps like this map here, which is a 3D map

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
of an abandoned underground coal mine in Pennsylvania

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
near Carnegie-Mellon University.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Over the past 10 years or so, I have worked on a number of different methods

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
for buildings maps that are quite sophisticated,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
like this particle filter method over here that you can see.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
All these methods have in common that we build a model of the environment

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
while also addressing the fact that the robot itself accrues uncertainty while it moves.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
When, in this example here, the loop is being closed,

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
you can see how our mapping technology is able to accommodate this

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and find a consistent map despite the fact that the robot drifted a little along the way.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The key insight in building maps is the robot itself

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
might lose track of where it is by virtue of its motion uncertainty.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You accommodate this in localization by using an existing map,

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
but now we don't have an existing map. We're building a map.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's where SLAM comes into play.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
SLAM doesn't stand for "slamming" a robot.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What it really means is "simultaneous localization and mapping."

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is a big, big, big research field.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Most of my AI book is about this technology,

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and today I want to show you my favorite method called "graph SLAM,"

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
which is also by far the easiest method to understand.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We will reduce the mapping problem to a couple of very intuitive

31
00:02:02,000 --> 99:59:59,999
additions into a big matrix and a vector, and that's it.
