1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,500
To get started running unit
tests with the Java plugin,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,360
all you need to do is place your
tasks in the source test Java folder.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,300
You can, of course,

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,820
change the location of your test code
by configuring the test source set.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,630
The only thing we have to manually
configure is our test dependencies.

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,800
In this example, we're using JUnit
as our testing framework, so

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,710
we have to add a JUnit dependency
to the test compile configuration.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,070
Running our test is easy.

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,280
Just run the test task.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,240
You'll notice Gradle has to perform
a bunch of other tasks before it

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,010
can actually run our tests.

12
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,950
It has to compile our Java source and
then compile our test source, and

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,550
finally it can run the tests.

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,600
In this case, the build was successful
indicating that all of our tests passed.

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,340
Gradle also provides detailed
reports on our test execution.

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,320
These reports are placed in
the build reports directory.

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,890
Let's take a look at
one of these reports.

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,090
In this case, you can see we have one
test and that the test was successful.

19
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,080
Of course in a real project
you'd have many tests.

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,600
Now I've gone and
edited our task so it will fail.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,430
Let's see what happens when
we run the test this time.

22
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,840
Oh no, our build failed.

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,269
Let's see what went wrong.

24
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,360
Execution failed for task ":test".

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,730
There were failing tests.

26
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,240
All right, we expected that.

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,060
Let's check out the report.

28
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,090
Looking at the report tells us we
ran one test, and that it failed.

29
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,160
And then we can even
look at our test class

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,910
to see the full stacktrace
of what went wrong.
