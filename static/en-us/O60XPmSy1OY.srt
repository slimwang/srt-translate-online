1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,810
Okay and that's all I want to show you about in,

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,570
inheritance, and in fact that is all I am going to

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,820
show you about templates. So just remember that templates are, a

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,240
great way to separate different types of code. You can keep your

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,970
HTML separate from your python for the purposes of this class,

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,710
which will make your life a little bit easier I hope.

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,670
At least your code a little more clean hm. Make more

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,450
readable code, better organized code is

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,270
more readable. Make more secure websites.

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,380
You know, if you use the autoscaping feature of Jinja

11
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,540
or other template new languages you dont have to worry so

12
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,080
much about putting, you know, insecure malicious data into your website.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,230
And finally, you know, you have HTML that's much easier to

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,180
modify. Instead of trying to manipulate strings in python you

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,430
have HTML in your HTML editor. It's much easier to manipulate.

16
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,750
So if you want to learn more about Jinja you can go

17
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,630
to this URL, to learn more. And the slots of documentation

18
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,150
here and there's all sorts of nice little escapes

19
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,630
and filters and convenience things that can make the templates

20
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,270
more and more powerful. So thanks for listening so

21
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,270
far and I hope this helps you in the future.
