1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,969
Now that you know how to
set up experiments and

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:07,530
perform matched pair design, we're going
to take your knowledge a step further.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,680
We're going to show you how to
think about non-numeric variables

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,860
that may have an impact
on your matching,

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,520
as well as discuss using
trends over time to match.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,790
In this lesson, we're going to
give you a chance to practice what

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,400
you've learned so far, and introduce
some new concepts along the way,

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,430
using a pricing elasticity
business problem.
