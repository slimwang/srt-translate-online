1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,600
Now try filling out the values for
the entire Minimax tree.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,129
Again, using the number of my
moves validation function.

3
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:10,179
Propagate the numbers to
the top of the Minimax tree.

4
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:13,189
Since we can't fit the entire
level three tree here,

5
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:15,759
we'll use this abbreviated
version instead.

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,170
A link to the full tree has been
provided in the instructor notes.

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,429
Open it up and compute all the values
starting at the bottom and

8
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:24,089
propagate them up to the top.

9
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,390
Then, report back the values for
a level one and the root node here.
