00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,003
Now, there's just one little blemish to the program that we've just written. It

2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:11,077
uses what programmers refer to as magic numbers. Look at this line over here,

3
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:17,204
and it begs to question why 25, why 255? Those look like values that a magician

4
00:00:17,204 --> 00:00:21,665
picked out of a hat. Instead of using magic numbers, it's a good idea to use

5
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:27,098
constants. Here is how you do this in Java. The keyword, final, indicates a

6
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:33,374
number that can never be changed that has assumed it's final value. Or like we

7
00:00:33,374 --> 00:00:37,200
would say in math, it's a constant value. So here, are the 25, I'll call it

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,212
added red and the 255 here, called max red. I defined these as variables just

9
00:00:42,212 --> 00:00:45,811
like you would define any other variable, except for the keyword final in

10
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:50,792
front. And also, it's a convention amongst Java programmers, that constants

11
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:56,030
should be written in upper case. Maybe with an occasional underscore. Now, go

12
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,320
ahead and rewrite the statement here, using these two constants instead of the

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,289
magic numbers. And put your answers into this box.
