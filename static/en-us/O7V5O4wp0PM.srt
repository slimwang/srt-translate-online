1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This is a question about logic.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We have four different statements.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Pink is True,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Pink or Green is True,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Pink and Green is True,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and not Pink implies that Green is True.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now these statements could imply each other,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and in this matrix over here,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'd like you to select each circle

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
where an implication is necessarily true. It's always true. For example,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
if you believe that Pink implies

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that Pink or Green is True,

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
then mark the A implies B circle, over here.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If you believe the Pink is True implies

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Pink and Green must be True,

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
then mark the circle A implies C, over here.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And so on for the entire matrix.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
One hint, D looks complex,

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but it happens to be the same as one of the previous cases.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So if you fill out the matrix for A to C first,

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and then copy the result over for D,

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
it will be easier, than if you start thinking about D separately.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And to find the equivalency of D,

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
just write down the Truth Table of these different things over here,

25
00:01:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and observe D is already represented among A to C.
