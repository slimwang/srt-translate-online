1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,700
So how do we improve reliability and availability?

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,760
We can try to avoid faults which is about

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,030
preventing faults from occurring in the first place.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,920
For example, the no coffee in the server room

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,340
is one example of a fault avoidance technique.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,180
If we spill the coffee on a server, that's

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,680
probably going to be a fault. So we're trying to

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,910
avoid that fault by preventing people from bringing coffee

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,630
into the server room. Next, we can have

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,929
a fault tolerance technique. They're about preventing faults

11
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:37,220
from graduating into failures. A typical fault tolerance

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,706
technique will use redundancy. For example, ECC can

13
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,716
be used for memory and ECC stands for

14
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:45,808
error-correcting code. So what happens is if there

15
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:51,280
is a fault, for example a particle strike, it flips a bit in memory. ECC will

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,290
allow us to read that block from memory, realize

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,230
that one of the bits has been flipped, and

18
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,026
actually correct that bit. And then we can also

19
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:04,001
have techniques like speeding up the repair, which really affect

20
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:08,510
only availability. And an example of such a technique

21
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,390
is when we have a spare hard drive in a

22
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,780
drawer so when a hard drive fails we can

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,634
quickly replace it. So this is a technique where basically

24
00:01:16,634 --> 00:01:19,714
the failure will still occur but we will shorten

25
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:22,563
the period that it takes to repair the system

26
00:01:22,563 --> 00:01:25,643
by basically, in this case, not having to wait

27
00:01:25,643 --> 00:01:28,140
for a new hard drive to arrive. We already

28
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,997
have one handy on site. So we will now

29
00:01:30,997 --> 00:01:34,770
look more closely at the fault tolerance techniques which

30
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,158
are usually techniques that we can apply in computer

31
00:01:38,158 --> 00:01:42,393
architecture to try to prevent faults from becoming failures and

32
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:46,420
thus, makes systems both more reliable and more available.
