1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,580
So we said we were going to
have controls in place,

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,560
that we're going to have
people responsible,

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,640
we're going to have policy to inform
people of our do's and don'ts and

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,540
things like that, but that's not
going to reduce our risk to zero.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,805
There's still the possibility,
because there are non-vulnerabilities,

6
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:18,965
where people became victims
of a phishing attack,

7
00:00:18,965 --> 00:00:21,725
we hear about those on a regular basis.

8
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:25,885
So the risk is not going to go down to
zero, something could still go wrong,

9
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:31,015
despite having the best planning and
best management for cyber security.

10
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:32,185
So if there is a risk,

11
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:36,575
how do we sort of get a sense of how
much risk is that we still have?

12
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:38,640
What kind of risk are we dealing with?

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,110
Assessing such risk is important
because we talked about cost benefit.

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,720
So if you're going to make
investment in cyber security,

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,370
those investment decisions have to
be based on risk and its reduction.

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,650
So you're going to pay for
a certain control.

17
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,250
How much is the risk being reduced?

18
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,920
And they say risk is going to be reduced
because it's never going to be zero.

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,790
The only way to make it zero is you
disconnect from the rest of the world.

20
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,910
But then you can't do anything useful.

21
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,520
So some risk is going to remain,
and if the risk remains, well,

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,440
how do you quantify it if your
investments are going to be based?

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,430
Investments passed a certain control,
what are you going to pay for it?

24
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,000
Certainly, there's a number.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,400
So if you're assessing risk or
quantifying it, how exactly do you?

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,290
It'll be great to say,
this is my risk and

27
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,380
this is what I can do to deal with it,
but how do you assess risk?

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,900
And one of the things we're
going to find out is that

29
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,940
quantifying it is actually not easy.

30
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,930
There are various frameworks
to sort of see what you do or

31
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,220
don't do that may pose
some degree of risk, but

32
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,670
actually quantifying it is what is hard,
so that's what we're talking about.
