Hi, I'm Mike Wales,
a program manager here at Udacity.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,970
We're very excited you've decided to
take this next step in advancing your

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,870
career, by enrolling in our senior
web developer nanodegree program.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,810
The Web and the capabilities
we're provided by browsers

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,630
has changed significantly
in the past few years.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,770
That's what this program is all about.

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,880
You'll learn from amazing Googlers,
many of which have worked directly

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,620
on the specs for
these exciting new features.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,840
Through the course of this program,
you'll develop a series of progressive

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,240
web applications, making use of
features like service workers,

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,860
push notifications, device center
access, and home screen installation.

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,250
Furthermore, you'll start analyzing
frameworks and technologies to figure

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,610
out the best tools for you and your
applications to work most efficiently.

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,890
By the end of this program, you'll
have a compelling portfolio that shows

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,370
employers you've mastered the latest
technologies within our field, and

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,230
you can develop web applications
with many of the features

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,380
only native web applications
have enjoyed in the past.

18
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,880
So good luck, and have fun learning.
