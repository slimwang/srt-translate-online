1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,120
We've now reached
the end of this course.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,660
We began with the nature and
problems of our healthcare system and

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,890
the key role that chronic disease plays.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,548
We made the case for
digital records and data sharing.

5
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:16,270
And we learned what the Federal
Government is doing to encourage their

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:16,790
adoption.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,410
We examined the key
underlying technologies and

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,990
looked at how they're being used in
actual systems and tools for providers,

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,240
patients, population and
public health, and clinical research.

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,990
We explored in more detail how data
can be aggregated for analysis.

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,770
And we concluded with a number of
exciting examples of the results that

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,469
can be achieved.

13
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,580
We're only at the beginning
of a long journey.

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,710
It's my hope that this course will
encourage you to come along and

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,426
be part of a generation that actually
achieves the long held dream of

16
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:56,260
transforming healthcare
through health informatics.

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,795
Please don't hesitate to
ask me if I can help.

18
00:00:58,795 --> 00:01:00,890
Good-bye, I wish you well.
