1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And now we have our final exam question or rather our final, final exam question.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This one is about something called morphogenesis.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This relates to how an organism knows where to grow its legs

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
or where to form colored stripes on its coat and things like that.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This really concerns pattern formation then.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And Alan Turing of all people--what a brilliant man--had an idea that an initially only

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
slightly random distribution of chemicals can evolve into a stable pattern over time.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So we're going to look at one model of how that could happen.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's say that we have two different chemicals.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We have one that we're going to call the activator and one that we're going to call the inhibitor.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now the activator causes production of both itself and of the inhibitor

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and also diffuses slowly through the space that we're considering.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The inhibitor on the other hand causes a reduction of both the activator and itself,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and it diffuses very quickly through the space.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So we can look at our graph over here. The x axis is just the space in general.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And the y axis is concentration of either chemical.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now, if we consider what's happening in the curves inside this blue circle,

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
we can see that where there's a little bit more activator than inhibitor

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the activator level rises due to diffusion.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The inhibitor that is also produced then flows quickly away because this is fast diffusion,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and it stops other peaks from developing nearby.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We have equations for how the concentration of the activator and inhibitor change with time.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We're going to call the concentration of the activator a and the concentration of the inhibitor b.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This constant right here shows us that yes in fact the activator is very slow moving

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
as opposed to this constant over here which shows that the inhibitor acts on a much shorter time scale.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Back over in the equation for da/dt this factor of 1-aÂ²

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
limits the growth of a when a turns to 1 or turn -1.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is basically similar to logistic growth.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Back in the equation for db/dt, you see that when a is greater than 0 since a term of just +a

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
is added in, this forces both a and b upward.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Since we have -0.7b, however, whenever b is greater than 0

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
this forces a and b both downward.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Looking at the code, the final task of the problem is actually going to be to use

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
the explicit finite difference scheme for this activator-inhibitor model that I just showed you--

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
the equations for da/dt and db/dt.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
However, before you get to that step, there are two other tasks that you must complete.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Both task one and task two concern using periodic boundary conditions.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Just to help you visualize this, I'm going to draw a little diagram.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We're considering a grid of some length by some length,

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and it's made up of all these little squares just like we've seen so many times before.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We know how the conditions in this square relate to the conditions

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
in the adjacent square and so on and so forth.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We can progress horizontally across the square until we reach the boundary.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Now, however, we have a problem.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What am I going to do with all the information that I have about this square?

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
In the same way, where does the information about this square come from?

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Periodic boundary conditions say if I pretend to create one more square

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
outside of the boundaries of the grid then this square is going to be identical

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
to the first square on the opposite side where we started.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We can do the same thing moving in the opposite direction horizontally

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and also in both directions vertically.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So for task one and task two of this final problem, you're going to figure out

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
what expressions are needed to ensure that these boundary conditions are put in place.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In the end, you should come up with some pretty interesting looking patterns.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm just going to give you a sneak peak of what you should end up with.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So here's what you'll get with your final plot.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You have one graph showing the concentration of the activator throughout the entire space

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
we're considering and the other graph showing the concentration of the inhibitor.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Congratulations on some awesome work in this course.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I hope you've had fun seeing how many different kinds of problems could be solved

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
using numerical approximation methods.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I know that this course has taught me to look at the world in a totally different way.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Great job on the final exam.
