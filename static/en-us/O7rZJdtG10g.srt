1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,130
So Cameron, why are we here?

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,660
>> I'm just checking out this soccer, I mean football scores.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,450
>> And how does that relate to JavaScript?

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,660
>> You'll see.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,500
Okay. So if I ask you whether or

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,630
not the US won any of these games, how you would respond?

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,200
Let's start with this first one against Ghana.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,570
Did we win?

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,410
>> True.

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,750
>> Correct.

11
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,850
Okay.

12
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,470
What about this one, against Belgium?

13
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,720
>> Hm.

14
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,590
False.

15
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,700
>> Also correct.

16
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,060
All right. One last one.

17
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,403
What about that one, against Argentina?

18
00:00:33,403 --> 00:00:33,903
>> Hm.

19
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:36,460
We didn't even play them.

20
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,650
>> correct.

21
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,518
And JavaScript gives us a way of expressing this, as Undefined.

22
00:00:43,132 --> 00:00:43,694
>> Okay.

23
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:45,450
I see what you're getting at.

24
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,330
True and False isn't as cut and dry as our football chart.

25
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,270
JavaScript has a set of values that can evaluate to true or

26
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,150
false, but many not equal true or false.

27
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,500
Because of this, we call these values truthy and falsy.

28
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,000
Under truthy, we've got true, non-zero numbers,

29
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:11,540
strings with a length of at least one, objects, arrays, and functions.

30
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:17,662
And under falsy, we've got false, zero,

31
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:23,540
empty strings, undefined, null and Not a Number.

32
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,450
>> Undefined means that the variable doesn't exist and

33
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,280
the interpreter doesn't know what you're referring to.

34
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,460
Null means that the variable exist, but has well no value.

35
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,850
It's usually used as a placeholder.

36
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,430
And Not a Number is not a number or a result that isn't a number.

37
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,570
>> There's a link in the instructor's notes comparing Truthy and

38
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,500
Falsy values in Python and JavaScript.

39
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,600
Let's take a quiz to make sure you got them all.
