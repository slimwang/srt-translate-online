00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,070
So one last point I'd like to show you about domains.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,730
Is browsers generally all have a Preferences page. And here I

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,460
am in Chrome's preferences. If I go to Under the Hood,

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,020
and I click on Content Settings, I can actually choose some relevant

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,860
options. Basically for Cookies, we can Allow all data to be

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,615
set. And this basically says, you know, allow all, all cookies to

7
00:00:19,615 --> 00:00:22,550
be set. Now the next option basically says, Only set cookies

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,275
that exist in this current session. So when I close my browser,

9
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,913
all those cookies will disappear. You know, we can block

10
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:31,084
sites from setting, setting any cookies. Or we could block cookies

11
00:00:31,084 --> 00:00:33,800
or, or websites from setting, setting third party cookies. So

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,990
that means if reddit.com makes a request to google.com, we won't

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,312
accept any google.com cookies. Because our browser says reddit. Even

14
00:00:41,312 --> 00:00:43,468
though we might make requests you know, for images or, or

15
00:00:43,468 --> 00:00:47,296
other things from other domains. And you know, another option,

16
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:50,445
Clear cookies. So you know, this is kind of well trodden

17
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:53,352
ground to set you know, which, which domains are allowed to

18
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:57,740
set what cookies. And generally I usually check this, this box. It

19
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,568
prevents websites from linking to third party data. And then having them

20
00:01:01,568 --> 00:01:04,959
you know, fill your browser with ad tracking stuff. So anyway, I

21
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,710
just thought you should be aware that these are, now you have

22
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,400
more information of how cookie domains work. And what's allowed to set

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,970
what. And you can even restrict it even further, or the user

24
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,540
can. So you want to be sure that you know, you're not operating

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,910
under the assumption that your cookies may

26
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,420
always be allowed, and may always be there.
