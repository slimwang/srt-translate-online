Well, Susan, I would say
personality psychologist,

2
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:06,501
because we're looking
at introverts and extroverts.

3
00:00:06,501 --> 00:00:09,244
And I know that personality psychologists
will look at the differences

4
00:00:09,244 --> 00:00:11,894
between different personality
traits like those two.

5
00:00:11,894 --> 00:00:14,349
And I would guess
cognitive psychologists too,

6
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:18,144
because I know they're interested in how
we learn and solve problems. Am I right?

7
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:19,783
That's right Lauren, good job.
