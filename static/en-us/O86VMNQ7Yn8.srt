1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,680
Your plan of attack and reasoning for

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,170
changing the fire based
schema sounds good.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,440
So, I give you my blessing
to implement buy and un-buy.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,930
In the end you should
have this functionality,

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,420
where the style changes as seen here.

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,160
If the item's bought it
should be crossed out and

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,700
it should say who it was bought by.

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,430
If it was bought by you it
should simply say Bought by You.

9
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,550
If it was bought by another user,
say the user's name right here.

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,780
Now if the item hasn't been bought yet,
you shouldn't see a strike through, and

11
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,370
you should also still
see this trashcan icon

12
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,950
which allows you to remove the item.

13
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,260
Items that have already been
bought can't be removed.

14
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,680
One final note, you should only be able
to unbuy an item that you've bought.

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,120
If Kagure says that she bought some jam,
Walter should not either by mistake or

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,350
on purpose, be able to un-buy
that jam she just bought.

17
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,980
Only Kagure should be able to un-buy
an item in case her figure strayed and

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,860
she bought it buy accident or
something else happened.

19
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,440
Okay so makes sense?

20
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,394
All right, well I'm sending
over the spec right now and

21
00:00:52,394 --> 00:00:53,940
I'll check back in with
you in a little bit.
