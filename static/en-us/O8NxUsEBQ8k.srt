00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,540
One last thing about Matlab.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,840
Matlab is incredibly powerful at
displaying images and plotting.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,810
There's unlimited number
of ways of doing this.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,860
What I would suggest you do is look
at the Matlab im show function,

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,353
and in fact as a shows here
you can do im show function.

6
00:00:16,353 --> 00:00:19,100
In fact, as it shows here,
you can do im show of some image and

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,130
then if you give it just a range low to
high, what it does is it will display

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,620
that image with the value low as black,
or anything less than low, and the value

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,600
high, or anything more than high, as
white and it will scale it in between.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,530
Matlab also has different color maps,
different ways of mapping

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,400
the value of the function to what
gets displayed on the screen.

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,247
Sometimes when you look at the results
and you're not seeing what you expect,

13
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:45,500
it's because you messed
up the display function.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,060
Your computation was correct,
it was just the display that was wrong.
