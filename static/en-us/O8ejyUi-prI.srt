1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,620
Recall the running time for

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,555
an all to all personalized
exchange on a ring network.

3
00:00:04,555 --> 00:00:07,760
Here is Mr. Tofu's question.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,160
What network has the best chance of
reducing the asymptotic running time

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,320
from being linear nP to being,
say logarithmic in P?

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,420
I'll give you four choices.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,020
Complete binary tree,
d dimensional torus, a hypercube, and

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,600
a fully connected network.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,710
And I want you to check
all that you think apply.
