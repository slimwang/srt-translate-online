1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,181
To in contrast, switches perform some amount

2
00:00:03,181 --> 00:00:05,788
of traffic isolation so that the entire

3
00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:09,069
LAN doesn't become one broadcast medium. But

4
00:00:09,069 --> 00:00:12,882
instead, we can partition the LAN into separate

5
00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:16,720
broadcast domains or collision domains. Now a

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,330
switch might break the subnet into multiple LAN

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,680
segments. Typically a frame that is bound for a host in the same part or

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,820
segment of the LAN is not forwarded to

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,650
other segments. So, for example if we had a

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,170
network with three hubs, all connected by a

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,800
switch, then each of these would be its own

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,480
broadcast domain. And if a host here wanted

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,500
to send a frame to another destination in the

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,320
same segment, well that frame would be broadcast within

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,050
that domain. But the switch would recognize that the

16
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,290
destination was in the same segment. And would not for the packet

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:01,280
on output ports, destined for other LAN segments where the destination was not.

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,690
Now enforcing this kind of isolation,

19
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,560
requires constructing some kind of switch table,

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,490
or state at the switch, which maps destination MAC addresses to output ports.
