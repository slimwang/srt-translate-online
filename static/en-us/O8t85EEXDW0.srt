1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,340
So in the versions basis technique of learning concepts incrementally, we always

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,980
have a specific model and a general model. As a new example comes along,

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,740
we ask ourselves is this a positive example of the concept that we learned, or

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,950
a negative example of the concept that we learned? If it's a positive example,

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,480
then we generalize the specific model. If it's a negative example,

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,420
we specialize the general model. Here is another set of visualizations to

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,540
understand the specific and general models. This is a specific model.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,730
This is a general model. The most specific model, matches exactly one thing.

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,200
The four legged, furry, black animal called Buddy. The most general

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,820
model matches everything, all animals. Here is a current specific model, and

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,010
as more positive examples come, you're going to generalize this specific model.

12
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,730
Here are some of the generalizations. Similarly,

13
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,330
here is the current general model, and as negative examples come, we're going to

14
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,390
specialize the general model, and here are some of the specializations.

15
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,280
As we'll illustrate in a minute, I'll start with the most general model and

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,520
try to specialize it. Some of these generalizations and specializations that

17
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,470
we are creating will no longer match the current data. When that happens,

18
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,520
we'll prune them out. As we prune on this side as well on this side, the two

19
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,620
pathways may merge depending on the ordering of the example. When they do merge,

20
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,010
we have a solution. The right generalization of the concept for the given

21
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,850
examples. So far we have been talking about this in very abstract terms.

22
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,930
Let's make this concrete with an illustration.
