1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,630
First, a session key should be a secret,
and unique to the session.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,170
This is true.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,360
Second, authentication should be
accomplished before key exchange.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:10,900
This is true.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,180
Third, a key benefit of using KDC is for
scalability.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,550
This is true.

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,750
Fourth, in order for

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:25,320
Bob to verify Alice's public key, the
certificate authority must be online.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,770
This is false, because as long as
the users have the CA's public key,

10
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,160
they can verify the certificate.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,991
Fifth, signing the message exchanges
in Diffie-Hellman eliminates

12
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:39,910
the man-in-the-middle attack.

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:40,430
This is true.
