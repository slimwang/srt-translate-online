1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,665
So let's talk about three of the best ways to measure brain activity, starting

2
00:00:03,665 --> 00:00:08,544
with the electroencephalography. This is commonly called an EEG. It records

3
00:00:08,544 --> 00:00:13,698
electrical activity of the brain through electrodes placed on the scalp. This

4
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:16,800
technique is really good at showing general activity of the brain, but it's not

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,157
terribly precise at showing where exactly the activity is occurring. This is

6
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:25,640
what a typical one would look like. Next, we have the Positron Emission

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,410
Tomography or PET scan for short. This measures blood flow to brain areas that

8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,456
are activated because neural response requires blood. This technology requires

9
00:00:35,456 --> 00:00:40,112
a person to ingest a harmless radioactive form of oxygen or glucose. The

10
00:00:40,112 --> 00:00:43,460
radioactive level in the oxygen is picked up by the scanning device during

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,956
brain activity. Computers then color code the most active areas in red,

12
00:00:47,956 --> 00:00:52,051
somewhat active areas in yellow, and the least active areas in blue and green,

13
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:58,141
like you see here. And finally, we have the Functional Magnetic Resonance

14
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:02,668
Imaging, or FMRI for short. This also measures blood flow to active brain

15
00:01:02,668 --> 00:01:08,541
regions. But it doesn't use radioactive forms of oxygen. Instead, the FMRI uses

16
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:14,318
magnetic fields to detect regions of the brain that are activated. One

17
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:17,216
advantage of this, is that it can give us a very precise picture of which part

18
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:23,572
of the brain is active. This is what a typical FMRI machine looks like. Now,

19
00:01:23,572 --> 00:01:27,168
it's really important to point out that none of these techniques directly

20
00:01:27,168 --> 00:01:32,268
measure neural activity. They all measure indirectly. There are ways of

21
00:01:32,268 --> 00:01:35,464
measuring individual neurons, but because it involves surgery its almost never

22
00:01:35,464 --> 00:01:40,106
used on humans. I know there's a lot of information on brain structure. So, if

23
00:01:40,106 --> 00:01:42,790
you need to you can go over some of the parts of the lesson again or always go

24
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,200
back to the document we gave you.
