Sometimes a set of instructions is not an algorithm. This is a slight

2
00:00:03,642 --> 00:00:07,210
modification of the algorithm that Kai gave you before. Why is this not an

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:12,438
algorithm? Is it because the description is ambiguous? The description contains

4
00:00:12,438 --> 00:00:16,543
steps that cannot be executed? Or the procedure does not always terminate? If

5
00:00:16,543 --> 00:00:26,033
you'd like a hint, think about what happens if you apply this algorithm to this

6
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:29,587
pattern.
