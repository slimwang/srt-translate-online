1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,496
Okay, let's see how you did. We have negative 4 squared. Well, negative 4

2
00:00:04,496 --> 00:00:11,537
squared, since the negative is not inside any parentheses, means it's not part

3
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:16,601
of the base. So, this is going to be negative 1 times 4 squared, and then we

4
00:00:16,613 --> 00:00:21,730
have negative 1. 4 squared, I know is 4 times 4. 4 times 4 is 16, so I have

5
00:00:21,742 --> 00:00:27,531
negative 1 times 16, give me -16. Okay let's try number 2. This time I have the

6
00:00:27,543 --> 00:00:34,016
negative inside the parenthesis, so that means my base is megative 3. So this

7
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:39,559
ones going to be negative 3 squared, which is -3 times -3. And we know -3 times

8
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:47,191
-3 gives us a positive 9. Now the 1st 2 problems had even exponents, let's try

9
00:00:47,203 --> 00:00:54,431
these 2 with odd exponents. The 1st problem I have -2 cubed, which means -1

10
00:00:54,443 --> 00:01:00,852
times 2 cubed. -1 times 2 cubed is -1 times 2 times 2 times 2, and 2 times 2

11
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:06,224
times 2 is 8, so I have negative 1 times 8, which is going to give me negative

12
00:01:06,236 --> 00:01:11,729
8. OK, number four. This time, like in number two, I have the negative 3 in

13
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:17,383
parentheses, which means it's part of our base. So, negative 3 cubed is just

14
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:22,760
negative 3 times negative 3 Times negative 3. Negative 3 times negative 3 is

15
00:01:22,772 --> 00:01:27,674
positive 9, positive 9 times negative 3 is negative 27. If I look at number 2

16
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:32,638
and number 4, I have a negative number as the base. In number 2, if you notice

17
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,671
the exponent here is even. When we raise a negative number to an even power the

18
00:01:37,683 --> 00:01:42,449
answer is going to be positive. And number 4 we have a negative number being

19
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:47,359
raised to an odd power. Whenever we raise negative numbers to an odd power, the

20
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:52,106
answer is going to be negative. It's something you can keep in mind. For number

21
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:57,041
5, notice we have a negative exponent. We know if we have a negative exponent we

22
00:01:57,053 --> 00:02:02,183
have to take the reciprocal of base, so 5 to the negative 2 is 5 over 1 to the

23
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:07,711
negative 2 because we can rewrite 5 as 5 over 1 and when we take the reciprocal

24
00:02:07,723 --> 00:02:13,295
that's the negative one fifth and we get rid off the negative once we take that

25
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:18,811
reciprocal of the base, notice once I take the reciprocal I get rid of the

26
00:02:18,823 --> 00:02:24,051
negative exponent. So we have 1/5 squared, which is 1/5 times 1/ 5. And that's

27
00:02:24,063 --> 00:02:27,945
going to be 1 times 1 is 1. And 5 times 5 is 25. So, 5 to the negative 2 is

28
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:33,964
1/25. Think about how you did. How many did you get right and wrong? Decide if

29
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:40,021
you need to go back and review the material again, before moving on to the next

30
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:40,662
section.
