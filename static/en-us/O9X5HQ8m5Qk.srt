00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,670
This wasn't too bad.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:07,120
I simply started with a jQuery object and passed it the string of .article-item.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,860
Let's go ahead and console.log it to see if it worked.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,610
I'll hit Test Run, okay.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,970
The page appeared down here.

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,010
I'll open up the console, and there we go.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,440
We can see a list of article items.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,750
Very cool.

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,690
Once again, there are some errors being shown here, and you might see some too.

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,570
But don't worry, just focus on what the console's producing for your code.
