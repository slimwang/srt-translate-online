1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,990
We've got sign up and login working.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,630
So I think the next task is
to implement logging out.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,620
I'd also like to implement what
happens when the user gets kicked off.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,270
So when can a user be kicked off?

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,870
Well, usually when a user logs in they
don't stay logged in for ever and

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,810
ever and ever.

7
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,960
And you can actually control how long
Firebase will allow you to have a logged

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,850
in user via the dashboards session
length property right here.

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,320
Just get to it by clicking
on the login and off tab.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,440
Selecting a value here
affects all forms of login.

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,880
I'm going to go ahead and
set this to one month.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,120
Now being kicked off
is an automatic thing,

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,320
whereas logging out is something
that you choose to do.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,060
But both of these two actions
should have the same effect.

15
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,580
And that is to clear the user data
out of shared preferences and

16
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,310
to take you back to the login activity.

17
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,570
Both of these actions will also
trigger an AuthStateListener.

18
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,470
So we can take the code
that does this and

19
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,170
put it inside of the AuthStateListener
and then we'll be set in both scenarios.

20
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,780
Now being kicked out because of
session time-out is something that

21
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,380
Firebase handles for you, but you're
going to need to hook up the login

22
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,240
button to have the correct behavior.

23
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,190
To log out a user you simply need
to get a Firebase reference and

24
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,680
call unauth on it.

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,870
That'll log out whatever user
is logged in on the client.

26
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,320
I've already written the log
out menu option for you.

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,560
You just need to make it visible.

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,020
And I'll send over more details
about that in the spec.

29
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,460
Hopefully that's enough
to get you started.

30
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,020
And good luck.
