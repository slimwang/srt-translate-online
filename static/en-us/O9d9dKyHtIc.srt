1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,230
ggplot allows us to easily create various summaries of

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,180
our data and plot them. This could be especially useful

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,810
for quick exploration and for combining plots of raw data,

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,900
like our original scatter plot with displaying summaries. This plot

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,490
is one of those displaying summaries and I want to

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,920
be able to display it over the original plot we

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,570
had for friend_count versus age. Let's see that first original

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,810
scatter plot again. Now since all these points are black,

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,960
I'm going to change the color of these. So that way when

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,730
I overlay the summary, it's easier to see. I'm going to make

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,016
the color here orange. So now, I've got my scatter plot

12
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:36,980
and I want to overlay the summary that we have from before.

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,258
I want to put this on top of this. I can add

14
00:00:40,258 --> 00:00:44,540
a geom_line to our plot to do so. Here I'm going to

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,590
pass the parameter stat and set it equal to summary, and

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,010
I'm going to give it a function for y. The fun.y parameter takes

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,090
any type of function, so that way we can apply it

18
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,520
to the y values. In this case, I want to take

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,530
the mean. And there it is, this is my summary line

20
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,800
are the mean friend count by age, over my raw data

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,825
or my scatter plot. This plot immediately reveals the increase in

22
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:09,460
friend_count for very young users and the subsequent decrease right after

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,480
that. We can add even more detail to this plot by

24
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,290
displaying multiple summaries at the same time. Despite having this conditional

25
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,150
mean plotted, we can't immediately see how dispersed around

26
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,800
the mean. For example, are the median friend_counts for

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,440
age 30 in this region or did they span

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,280
all the way up to 2,000? Certainly we can see

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,290
that most users, even young ones, don't have more

30
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,970
than 2,000 friends. We can help ourselves understand this conditional

31
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,030
distribution of friend_counts by also plotting quantiles of the

32
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,916
data. So let's use the 10%, 50% or median and

33
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:46,520
90% quantiles. We'll start by adding our 10% quantile summary line

34
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,060
to this plot. So I'll add another geom_line, I'll pass it

35
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,570
a stat of summary and then for the function, I'm going to

36
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,320
pass it quantile instead of mean. I need to set the

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,145
probability equal to one tenth or 0.1. This code gives me

38
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:02,170
10% quantile on my plot. Now I want it to appear

39
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,550
different from the mean. So, I'm going to add some details to

40
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,050
color it and to make it dash. I'll set the line type

41
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,860
table to two to make it dash and I'll set the

42
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,114
color equal to blue. There that's much better. Now to add

43
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:16,029
the 90% quantile, I would just need to change the probability

44
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:19,130
here to 0.9 instead of 0.1. So I'm going to add another

45
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,660
line. I'll use the same parameters as before and then just

46
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,080
change the probability. So here we can see that 90% of

47
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,090
users have friend counts below this line. The last thing I'll

48
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,670
do is add in the 50% mark, which is the median. Now

49
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,310
I won't make this geom_line dash, but I will make the color blue.

50
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,950
Now this is quite a plot. I want you to try creating this

51
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,890
same plot in R and try adding a coord_cartesian layer to zoom in

52
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,490
on different parts of this graph.

53
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,600
Look at the documentation for coord_cartesian if

54
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,870
you need help. And definitely be sure that you understand all of this

55
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,600
code. I know that there is a lot going on here. Once you've

56
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,420
got a strong idea of this plot and you've explored it a bit,

57
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,140
I want you to make some observations about the plot. What do you notice?
