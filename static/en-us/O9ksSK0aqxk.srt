Thanks, Susan. Now here's an interesting finding. Using neural imaging,

2
00:00:03,585 --> 00:00:07,160
researchers found that when Genie was listening or speaking, the activity in

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,482
her brain was located mostly in the right hemisphere. Now remember, we just

4
00:00:12,482 --> 00:00:15,667
mentioned that language comprehension and production is located in the left

5
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:20,255
hemisphere. This led researchers to suggest that the left hemisphere speech

6
00:00:20,255 --> 00:00:25,600
development requires stimulation from the environment. During what's called

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,273
sensitivity period if it's to develop properly. The sensitivity period are ages

8
00:00:30,273 --> 00:00:34,827
before critical stimulation and learning must occur, otherwise the window of

9
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:41,286
learning will close and it will become very difficult to learn languages. If

10
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:44,784
you are interested learning more about this case study, the movie Mockingbird

11
00:00:44,784 --> 00:00:49,602
Don't Sing, is based on her life story. Although tragic, it demonstrates again

12
00:00:49,602 --> 00:00:53,198
how much we can learn from human thought and behavior by using case studies

13
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:55,210
such as these.
