1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,820
In the virtualized set up the hypervisor sits

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:08,410
between the guest operating system and the hardware.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,090
So the picture gets a little bit complicated.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,950
Inside each one of these operating systems of

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,600
course they use a level processes and each

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,240
process is in its own protection domain. What

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,650
that means is that in each of these

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,090
operating systems, there is a distinct page table

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,490
that the operating system maintains on behalf of the processes that are running

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,730
in that operating system, similarly in this case. Does the hypervisor

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,790
know about the page tables maintained on behalf

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,780
of the processes that are running in each one of these individual operating

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,100
systems? The answer is no. Windows and Linux are simply protection

14
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,740
domains distinct from one another so far as the

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,450
hypervisor is concerned. The fact that each of Windows

16
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:04,080
and Linux within them contain application of a processes

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,300
is something that the hypervisor doesn't know about at all.
