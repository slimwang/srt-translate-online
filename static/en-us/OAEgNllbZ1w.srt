1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,719
All right,
back to our regularly scheduled program.

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,386
All right, we're going to introduce
this using one-dimensional signal and

3
00:00:06,386 --> 00:00:07,450
then we'll go to 2D.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,420
So here we have a signal, and
it's a 1D signal, and here's a filter.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,930
And that filter,
if you take a look, actually

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:22,390
this filter here looks a lot like,
oh yeah, something like that.

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,960
And that's because I made this and
I actually pulled out that chunk.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,660
Okay?

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,050
But the system doesn't know that yet.

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,270
And what we're going to do is we're
going to do the normalized correlation

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,910
of this filter with that signal.

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,700
When you do that,
you get a result that looks like this.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,838
And you'll notice its maximum is at
this peak, this peak here in red, right?

14
00:00:42,838 --> 00:00:45,358
Right here, okay?

15
00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:49,323
And that's the location
of where this filter

16
00:00:49,323 --> 00:00:52,568
came from out of that signal, okay?

17
00:00:52,568 --> 00:00:57,338
So the highest value is exactly
when these things match.

18
00:00:57,338 --> 00:01:02,644
There are a couple of reasons to explain
that, here's the one that I like best.

19
00:01:02,644 --> 00:01:07,171
Pretend for a moment that both of
our signals were normalized, or

20
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:10,724
were sort of shifted, so
that they were about zero.

21
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:14,173
So sometimes they went positive and
sometimes they went negative, okay?

22
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:17,840
And remember we've got the scale
being approximately the same.

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,950
because they scale up, so
their standard deviation is one.

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,880
If I take one filter and
I lay it over the image and

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,570
I'm going to multiply them and
then sum them up.

26
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,720
Remember, some of my values are positive
and some of them might be negative.

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,730
I realize this is the first time
we've talked about negative signals.

28
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,310
In fact, on the drawing here you'll
notice it's zero in the middle.

29
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,020
But if I've got positive numbers and
negative numbers and

30
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,820
I've got positive numbers and negative
numbers in my filter, if I want to do

31
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,840
a multiplication and have it come up as
high as possible, when does that happen?

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,200
Well the obvious intuition is,
well whenever my pixels in the image

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,494
are positive, I want my coefficients
in my filter to be positive.

34
00:01:57,494 --> 00:02:00,675
Because positive times positive
is what negative, Megan?

35
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:01,579
>> Positive times positive?

36
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,097
>> Yeah.

37
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:03,271
>> Positive.
>> Positive.

38
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:06,957
And what do I want where
the image is negative?

39
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:12,083
I want the filter coefficients
to be negative also, right?

40
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:15,370
Because negative times negative is what,
Megan?

41
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,780
>> Positive.
>> Positive, very good.

42
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,970
Yeah, she went to film school,
but she's doing great.

43
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,750
Anyway, and so if you think of
sort of a filter as having,

44
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,750
because we've scaled it, it can't go
arbitrarily high and arbitrarily low.

45
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,260
If you get that signal to
be lined up exactly, so

46
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,440
wherever it's positive
the other is positive and

47
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,900
where one is negative the other is
negative, you get the maximum value.

48
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,030
There are a lot more sophisticated
ways of showing this involving

49
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,570
differences in distributions and
things like that.

50
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,460
They all basically will show you
that the maximum value you can get.

51
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,840
The product of these is when
they're exactly the same.
