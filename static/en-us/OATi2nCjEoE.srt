So here are four of the animals that David classified as birds. Let us look at

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,320
the kind of features that he examined in order to classify whether or

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,228
not an animal was a bird. He may have used several features,

4
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:16,143
some of which he articulated, others that he may not have articulated. So

5
00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:20,330
whether a animal has wings? Whether it has feathers? Whether it has a beak? And

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,360
so on and so forth. One could add more features here if one wished to do so.

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,140
We do classification all the time. AI agents need to

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,630
do classification all the time also. Why? Why is classification so ubiquitous?
