1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,930
In this lesson, we're going to introduce
a new element to our algorithms.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:04,560
Randomization.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,970
In a full course on complexity or
one on randomized algorithms,

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,220
we might go back to the definition
of turning machines,

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,860
include randomness in the model and then
argue that other models are equivalent.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,070
Here, we're just going to assume that
the standard built in procedures

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,069
available in most
programming languages work.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,490
Of course in reality these only
produce pseudorandom numbers, but for

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,090
the purpose of studying algorithms,

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,390
we assume that they
produce truly random ones.

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,300
The lesson we'll use a few
simple randomized algorithms

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,150
to help motivate probability theory,
and then use the basic theorems

13
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,369
to characterize the behavior of a few
slightly more sophisticated algorithms.

14
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,430
Some ideas that come up
include independence,

15
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:50,860
expectation, Monte Carlo versus
Las Vegas algorithms, derandomization.

16
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,760
And the end, we'll tie our study
of algorithms back to complexity

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,930
with a brief discussion of
probabilistically checkable proofs.
