1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,429
Now in the early days of AI, there was
a lot of excitement and work on logic.

2
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:08,279
Can you give us a bit of historical
perspective on the topic.

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:13,000
>> AI started in the 50s through the 70s
with the idea that what we needed was

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,170
better languages and systems for
writing down logical statements, and

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,170
once we have written enough of them,
we should be able to do anything.

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,500
And some things worked great.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,789
We were able to make a program be
the best chess player in the world.

8
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,039
But other projects failed.

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,629
And I think there were two main issues.

10
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:32,509
One, it was a mistake to try to make
statements only in Boolean logic,

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:33,710
where everything is true or false.

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,390
And that's because
the world is uncertain.

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,049
So the logic of probability
is a better fit to the world.

14
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:40,788
And we didn't get good algorithms for

15
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:43,191
dealing with probability
until the mid 1980s.

16
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:43,778
And two,

17
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:48,272
we realized it was too laborious to
try to write down everything by hand.

18
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:50,911
In the 1990s to the current day,
more and

19
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:55,356
more data was becoming available online,
and now we think first of learning

20
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:58,913
about the world from data rather
than writing rules by hand.

21
00:00:58,912 --> 00:01:01,187
And still logic has its place.

22
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:03,626
Well how is logic used today?

23
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,203
>> Well there's many domains
where we can eliminate much

24
00:01:06,203 --> 00:01:10,939
of the uncertainty of the real world and
solve significant problems using logic.

25
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:14,129
One example would be a company
like FedEx, planning

26
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:18,239
all the deliveries of its packages
using its huge fleet of vehicles.

27
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,549
We can describe this
as a logic problem and

28
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:22,989
find a solution that minimizes time and
expense.

29
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,160
>> Peter will also be talking about
algorithms that are useful for

30
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,719
understanding how expert systems work.

31
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:32,980
Expert systems are used
throughout the world, and are so

32
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,510
common that most people don't even
think about them as AI anymore.

33
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,980
One famous example is that during
the first Persian Gulf War,

34
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,560
one superhuman decision made
by one military expert system

35
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,790
about where to place a supply base saved
the United States $2 billion, which

36
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,790
was more money than DARPA ever invested
in artificial intelligence research.

37
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,088
One of the things I like about
this section is how you and

38
00:01:57,087 --> 00:02:01,464
Sebastian move from logical
representations to planning algorithms,

39
00:02:01,465 --> 00:02:05,859
to planning algorithms for when actions
or even the world is uncertain.

40
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:08,061
What directions do you
think we will be seeing for

41
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:09,745
planning algorithms in the future?

42
00:02:09,745 --> 00:02:14,045
>> Well, learning from examples
would be an important area.

43
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:17,949
Tansfer of learning across domains,
where we learn to play in one area and

44
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:20,060
then execute that in another area.

45
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,950
Interactive planning, where human
machine team solves problems together,

46
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:28,869
and a lot of the issues
are what's the best

47
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,569
interface rather than just
getting the right answer.

48
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,509
Being able to work together as a team.

49
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:37,239
And being able to explain things in
terms that humans can understand, so

50
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,930
that the humans can add things that
might have been missed in the original

51
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,530
statement of the problem.

52
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,020
>> In these videos, be on the look
out for the resolution algorithm.

53
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,516
It is an elegant way of inferring new
knowledge from a knowledge base and

54
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:50,414
is one of my favorite in this section.

55
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:53,864
Graphplan, which is described
in the book reading,

56
00:02:53,864 --> 00:02:58,465
was created by Georgia Tech's own
Merrick Furst back in 1995, and

57
00:02:58,465 --> 00:03:02,313
made planning practical for
a whole new range of problems.

58
00:03:02,313 --> 00:03:07,608
Finally, value iteration is a key
concept for Markov decision processing.

59
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:11,335
Understanding these algorithms is a good
school for this section because they

60
00:03:11,335 --> 00:03:14,335
require a firm foundation in
the basics that are being taught.
