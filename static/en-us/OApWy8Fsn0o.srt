1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So the final formula gives us the following, =1/NΣXi²-1/N²(ΣXi)².

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And noticed we didn't use any of these elements over here so let me just take them off.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Notice how the calculation of σ² which we're going to rewrite a little bit as follows.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This obviously the same. Noticed how this calculation doesn't rely on this term here anymore.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It solely uses the terms over here. In particular, we have the ΣXi², we have N.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
N² is easily calculated from N, and we have ΣXi²--sum them up and when they all summed up,

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
we find the square of the sum of it--so here the square is outside

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and here the square is inside as we sum the elements.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So the counter statistics of ΣXi, ΣXi² and N are sufficient to compute the variance

10
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the single pass through the data, let's just calculate the variance.
