00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,120
We looked at these images in the last lecture.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,240
We started off with one image and then I also showed you another one.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,220
This one.

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,660
In both of these images, the same two subjects just taken from

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,510
a different viewpoint and, of course, also different focal length.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,910
In this image, I'd basically taken the picture with a smaller focal length and

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,530
here, of course, with a larger focal length.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,870
Basically, the two subjects were at different distances.

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,630
The reason for us to look at these two images was because I'm interested in

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,560
showing you that by changing the focal length, allows us to move back and

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,220
still capture the same scene and by changing the viewpoint,

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,440
we can change the perspective of the scene.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,060
For example, here, these two characters look pretty much sitting next to

14
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,790
each other even though they are almost a meter and a half away.
