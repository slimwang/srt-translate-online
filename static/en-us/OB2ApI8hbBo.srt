1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,590
So let's talk about some of the key
features that we have to implement.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,920
Or some of the other functionality that
the Trusted Computing Base must have.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,410
We have to have a complete mediation.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,660
We have to guarantee that
there's no way to get to

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,330
a resource without going through
the trusted computing base, okay, or

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,320
the reference monitor
that it implements.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,990
We have to have a trusted path.

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,560
Remember, trusted path is needed
because otherwise what could happen?

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,940
Well, some malicious program, a trojan
for example, can spoof the interface of

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,530
your trusted system and ultimate trusted
system is your trusted computing base.

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,580
So it could look like
the operating system and

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,370
you may think that the log in is being,
you're interacting with the OS.

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,040
A trusted path allows you to guarantee

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,680
that when you think you're talking
to the trusted computing base or

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,850
the operating system,
you indeed are talking to that system.

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,610
Which, of course, prevents programs,

17
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,050
malicious programs in particular,
Keyloggers.

18
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,890
A quick example of they're trying
to log your key strokes or

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,920
keys that you press to figure out
your password or whatever it is.

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,390
So, it prevents these kind of programs
from tapping the path from keyboard

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,962
where you press your keys to the system
where the key presses are captured.

22
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:17,950
This path has to be trusted,
and a result of that trust

23
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,000
is that malicious programs are not going
to be able to gain access to it and

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,210
be able to tap and see the information
that is being sent over it.

25
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,520
The next thing we have,

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,150
in terms of functionality features,
we didn't talk about that.

27
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,610
A lot of our focus has been on
the prevention side, the idea that,

28
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,770
you know, authentication makes
sure it's the right person.

29
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,010
Access control says the right
person gets access to

30
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,790
a resource that is getting requested.

31
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,850
The thing is that, no matter
how hard we work at prevention.

32
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,630
Things could go wrong.

33
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,020
Somebody can steal your password,
for example.

34
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,130
And they can login as you.

35
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,470
If we keep an audit log
of what has happened,

36
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,610
what objects have been accessed,
when, by whom.

37
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,370
Well this sort of an audit log can
come in handy when, and some abuse or

38
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,550
misuse might actually take place.

39
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,630
So, prevention, if it's not 100%,
then you have to go to detection, and

40
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,570
having a log will help
you with that detection.

41
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,397
Typically, detection is that for

42
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:23,180
some definition of unusual,
you see some unusual activity in

43
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,450
the system that potentially means
an attacker has gained access to it and

44
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,950
that unusual use can be,
an analysis that you do,

45
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,970
that detection is possible when you have
a recorder log of what the system did.

46
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,600
Keep in mind that this will only be
useful if we actually look at the log

47
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,330
and you're able to correctly
assess when there is an abuse.

48
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:53,390
So although audit, we're not going to
talk a great deal about that here,

49
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,010
but Lamson, one of the pioneers
who worked in security,

50
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,620
actually had this thing called
the gold standard of security.

51
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,200
This was based on the three AUs.

52
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,770
The authentication,
the authorization, and finally audit.

53
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,270
Periodic table symbol for gold is AU.

54
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,460
So the three AUs actually define
the gold standard for security.

55
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,120
And the third AU typically is
audit function that system.

56
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,220
So I said it's useful
only if you look at it,

57
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,290
but also it's only useful if malicious
programs are not able to tamper with it.

58
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,650
Okay, so it's integrity obviously
is going to be important.
