1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,540
Here's another table.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,570
This one has some people's heights and
weights in it.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,300
Each row of this table contains the same
sort of data about a different person.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,000
As programmers, we're familiar
with the idea of data types.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,830
A string, like Alan, is a different
type from a numerical value like 188.

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,528
But 188 is the same type as 72 even
though they represent values with

7
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:25,810
different meanings.

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,560
One is a height in centimeters and
the other is a weight in kilograms.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,020
Every column in a database table will
have some type associated with it.

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,810
All the values in that column will
be of the same type, but moreover,

11
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,260
they'll also have
the same kind of meaning.

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,339
We wouldn't mix centimeters and
kilograms in the same column.

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,090
The database system itself doesn't
know which numbers are centimeters and

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,850
which numbers are kilograms.

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,370
We have to keep track of that for
ourselves when we write code.

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,880
Here's another example.

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,830
Georgia is a string, a piece of text.

18
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,770
But a string that represents
the name of a country, like Georgia,

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,140
does not have the same kind of a meaning
as a string that represents a U.S.

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,560
state, like Georgia, or the font
Georgia, or someone's first name,

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,910
like Georgia O'Keeffe.

22
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:19,040
And the number 413 means something
different if it's a hotel room number,

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,350
or an amount of money, or the telephone
area code for western Massachusetts.

24
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,650
To think about this more clearly,
let's have a quiz.

25
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,930
Here are five pieces of data.

26
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,260
Think about what type each of these is,
and mark the check boxes next to

27
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,880
two pieces of data that
definitely have the same type.
