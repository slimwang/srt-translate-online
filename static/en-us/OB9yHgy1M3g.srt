1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,770
Now we're going to get our hands dirty with a real code base.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,280
No more small example applications anymore.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,801
We'll be working with a well-written and

4
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:11,610
complete to-do application called TodoMVC.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,130
TodoMVC is actually a project where professional developers have written

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,410
exactly the same to-do application in all these

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,570
different popular organizational libraries and frameworks.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,470
It's meant to let people see the differences between libraries and frameworks.

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,890
Now, given your knowledge of KnockoutJS, you could take a look at the entry

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,640
under Knockout and understand most of it pretty quickly if you apply yourself.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,190
But that is not what we're going to be doing this lesson.

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,990
After all, this course is not about learning KnockoutJS.

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,568
We've learned separation of concerns with our model view octopus paradigm, and

14
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:51,430
we've learned about Model View ViewModel in Knockout.

15
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,990
And now we're going to see how another organizational library does it.

16
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,580
Once you're done with this lesson, you'll feel empowered to pick up

17
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,380
projects that you've never seen before and learn them.

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,310
Now, this new code base that you're going to be working with will be

19
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,660
based on one of these, but I'm not going to tell you which one.

20
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,330
You're going to have to figure that out.

21
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,300
Go ahead and get the code from the GitHub repository in the instructor notes and

22
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,980
then we'll explore it all together.
