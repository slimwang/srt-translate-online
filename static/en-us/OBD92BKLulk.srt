1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,410
So let's see if we understand the
differences between message passing and

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,960
shared memory.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,560
If we have a program in which one core
know how to initialize an array and

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,470
then all others need to read the entire
array, then the number of lines

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,340
of code for the data distribution of
the array once it has been initialized.

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,370
Does message passing have fewer lines
of code than shared memory for this?

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,160
Does it have about equal
number of lines of code?

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,150
Or do you think that it gets more
lines of code than shared memory,

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,620
in which case write a larger than sign?

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,150
And then once we have
achieved data distribution.

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:42,610
Synchronization that is needed to make
sure that the initialization is done

12
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,560
before we can read the array adds
how many lines of code in a message

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,790
passing version of the code, and in
the shared memory version of the code?

14
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:57,584
You only need to say whether it's 0 or
larger than 0.
