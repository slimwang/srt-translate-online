1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The correct answer are it ignores measurements and will likely fail.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It ignores measurements, because the measurement sets the weighting factor

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
in this resampling process, but with only 1 particle

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
the same particle will be resampled no matter what.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So the chances of the particle to be resampled is 1.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Therefore, it's independent of the actual measurement.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The robot truly ignores the measurements.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Because it ignores the measurements, it'll likely fail, so works fine is incorrect.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
For ignoring robot motion--that's not the case.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Even a single particle can be sampled forward.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So these are the two correct answers over here.
