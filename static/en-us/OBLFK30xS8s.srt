00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,912
This one was kind of tricky, especially with the independent versus dependent

2
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:08,506
variable. The independent variable is the type of food. The type of food

3
00:00:08,506 --> 00:00:13,081
influences how much cows eat, which is the dependent variable. The null

4
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:17,880
hypothesis is that cows will eat similar amounts of food. Where as the

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,784
alternative if you remember from the last lesson, is that at least two groups

6
00:00:21,784 --> 00:00:26,825
well significantly differ. In this case that means that cows will eat more or

7
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:29,360
less of one food over another.
