00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,179
Now that we've learned about factoring by grouping, let's try another practice

2
00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:11,646
problem. Here, we have four terms one, two, three, four, 18x squared minus 9xy

3
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:16,222
minus 30x plus 15y. Since there is four terms, we know that we're going to be

4
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:19,845
factoring by grouping and I want you to put your answer in this box. Don't

5
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:22,489
forget to factor out the GCF if you can find one.
