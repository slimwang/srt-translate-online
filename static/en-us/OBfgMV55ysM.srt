00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,859
Here are the answers.

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:02,700
First question.

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,040
Analysis models can adapt well to changes in customer requirements.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,580
This is true because analysis models are constructed before design,

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,190
therefore they should not be affected by design constraints and

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,130
can adjust more easily to changes in customer requirements.

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,149
Second question.

8
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,310
Analysis models should represent the approach that will be taken in design.

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,150
This is false.

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,290
We actually want to avoid mixing analysis and

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,620
design together or else we might bias the design approach that is taken.

12
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,260
Third question.

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,060
Analysis models are resilient to changes in hardware.

14
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:31,790
This is true.

15
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,830
Analysis models should not make assumptions about the running environment of

16
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,830
a system and can adjust to changes in hardware.

17
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,890
Fourth question.

18
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,190
Analysis models include all components required by a system.

19
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,490
This is false because there will likely be additions to a system for

20
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,730
collection classes or

21
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,420
other types of utility classes that an analysis model would not specify
