1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,390
Okay Michael, so
I think we're done with this section.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,230
So it's time for
you to tell me what have we learned?

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:12,587
>> So, this was the section on
generalizing generalization and scaling.

4
00:00:12,587 --> 00:00:13,910
>> Right.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,420
>> So, we connected that idea
with function approximation,

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,180
which was the section that I did.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:19,860
>> Right.

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,430
So, we talked about generalization
beyond function approximation.

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,673
>> To function approximation.

10
00:00:24,673 --> 00:00:25,890
>> And beyond!

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,290
>> [LAUGH] To function approximazation.

12
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,474
And beyond!

13
00:00:28,474 --> 00:00:29,110
>> Okay.

14
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,470
And what kind of
generalizations did we do?

15
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,765
>> So, we did temporal abstraction.

16
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:35,610
>> Mm-hm.

17
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,298
>> And in particular, we talked
about temporally extended actions.

18
00:00:40,298 --> 00:00:42,927
>> Mm-hm, or?

19
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:44,570
>> SMDPs?

20
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,060
>> Well, options.

21
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,120
>> Right, right, right.

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,856
>> And SMDPs.

23
00:00:49,856 --> 00:00:52,294
And, what does SMDP stand for?

24
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:53,760
>> Semi markup decision processes.

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,635
>> That's right, just like the truck.

26
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:56,770
>> Right,
a semi markup decision process.

27
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:57,301
>> Exactly.

28
00:00:57,301 --> 00:00:59,244
>> And so, SMDP with 18 wheels.

29
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:00,626
>> Yes.

30
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:03,683
So, we learned about options in temporal
abstraction, which is really cool.

31
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:04,453
And what else?

32
00:01:04,453 --> 00:01:06,384
>> I want to say that led
us to goal abstraction.

33
00:01:06,384 --> 00:01:08,500
>> It did, as a matter of fact.

34
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,570
And in particular, do you remember?

35
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,540
>> Mediating between the different
goals, competing goals.

36
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,739
>> We did, and that had a larger name.

37
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:20,050
We talked about modular
reinforcement learning.

38
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:20,900
>> Right.

39
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,730
I should remember that because I
was alive when phones were modular.

40
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,360
That was like a big deal.

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,591
>> Nobody was alive when
phones were modular, Michael.

42
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:28,099
In any case,

43
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:30,816
one of the things that we got out-
>> I was alive before phones were

44
00:01:30,816 --> 00:01:33,709
modular and I was alive when
they switched to being modular.

45
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:36,430
>> [LAUGH] You're such a hipster.

46
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,066
Okay, so we talked about modular RL or
MRL as the kids call it, and

47
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:43,918
the word you were searching for
before, I think, was arbitration.

48
00:01:43,918 --> 00:01:45,784
>> Arbitration!

49
00:01:45,784 --> 00:01:48,027
It just seems so arbitrary.

50
00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:49,520
>> That's right.

51
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,574
We talked about one other kind of
abstraction, you might recall.

52
00:01:52,574 --> 00:01:53,245
>> State abstraction?

53
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:54,225
>> Yeah, state abstraction.

54
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:56,494
>> We got to state abstraction
from the temporal abstraction.

55
00:01:56,494 --> 00:01:57,267
>> That's right.

56
00:01:57,267 --> 00:02:00,063
But not only do we get some state
abstraction from the temporal

57
00:02:00,063 --> 00:02:03,235
abstraction, that is, not having
to pay attention to all possible,

58
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:06,516
all states for all particular options,
it actually turns out that state

59
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:09,411
abstraction is sort of what
function approximation is doing.

60
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:10,100
>> Hm, okay.

61
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,833
All right, Yeah.

62
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,092
>> All right?
>> Yeah.

63
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:13,557
So, I think that's pretty cool.

64
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:14,613
Was anything else that we learned?

65
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:16,240
I don't think so.
Well, we had a name for

66
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,604
at least temporal abstraction,
we should at least mention that,

67
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:22,260
nothing else,
that this is a form of hierarchical.

68
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,219
>> And we talked about
quintessential search, but

69
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:27,611
I think we actually meant quiescence.

70
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:30,292
>> We did, [LAUGH], and
what does quiescence mean?

71
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:31,099
>> Quietness.

72
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:34,958
>> Right, and in particular
it means that you are forced-

73
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,160
>> In the search it means that there's

74
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,980
not all this crazy search
backtracking stuff happening anymore.

75
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,400
Things have settled down and

76
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,550
you know exactly what the next
thing is going to be.

77
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,770
>> Right.
>> So everything is settled.

78
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,220
>> Right, and once things are settled,

79
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,350
then you might as well not
count it against your search.

80
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,710
It has no more sort of
exponential hit on your search.

81
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,460
>> Right.
>> You're forced.

82
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,340
We can treat it as almost as
if it's a single move, say, or

83
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,590
a single action because once you do
this the next thing's happening,

84
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,299
the next thing's happening, the next
thing's happening and [INAUDIBLE]
