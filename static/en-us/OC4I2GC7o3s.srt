1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,620
These kinds of effects get more interesting when your

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,730
source material is a set of moving pictures.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,050
The effects that we're doing on single images can be done in

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,270
real time while showing a movie.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,320
Let's begin with a simple HTML page containing a video that we want to

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,130
use with the canvas.

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,480
We can see that it has a very empty script tag.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,320
Our video can be any given size, so hard coating dimensions is not optimal.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,230
Luckily for us, the video tag has a loaded metadata event that we can

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,618
subscribe to and set the width and the height.

11
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,420
Like loaded metadata,

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,960
the play event tells us when the user has started playing the video.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,030
If the video isn't paused or ended, it's going to execute this draw function,

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,090
which tells it to draw the image to the canvas.

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,680
Before we refresh this page, let's see if you can predict what happens.

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,900
What will this code do?

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,230
It shows the video in sync with the source video.

18
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,580
Or does it show a single frame of the video?
