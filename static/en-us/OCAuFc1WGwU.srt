1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,610
>> Well, it looks like we're only at 12,000 Hz right now, Andy.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,170
>> Yeah, and it looks like they are all able to hear that. Lauren, when can we

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,920
expect to see contestants to drop off?

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,385
>> Well, the range for human hearing is between 20 hertz and 20,000 hertz. So, if

5
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:18,685
I had to put my money on it, I would guess we'd see people drop off at around

6
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:30,738
17,000 to 18,000 Hz. And for those of you trying to compete at home, I'd

7
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:43,608
recommend turning your sound up, closing your eyes, and trying to see which of

8
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:54,894
these tones you can identify it.

9
00:00:54,894 --> 00:00:55,573
[SOUND].

10
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:58,315
>> That was really exciting Andy.

11
00:00:58,315 --> 00:01:00,729
>> It was. Let's see if we can talk to the winner as they prepare for the next

12
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:02,335
event. Susan, are you there?

13
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:06,764
>> Hi Andy, I can hear you loud and clear. You must be talking between 20 and

14
00:01:06,764 --> 00:01:11,573
20,000 hertz, right? I've got the winner here of the pitch absolute threshold

15
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:15,445
competition, Jacques. That was incredible, how did you do it?

16
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:17,810
>> Well, I've always taken good care of my ears.

17
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,661
>> Well, thank you and congratulations. I'll let you go ahead and prepare for your

18
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:24,265
next event. Back to you, Lauren and Andy.

19
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:28,660
>> Thanks Susan. We're going to take a brief break, and get a word from one of our

20
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,870
sponsors while the next event is being prepared.
