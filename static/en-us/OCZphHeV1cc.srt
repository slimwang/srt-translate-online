1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,700
So as you can imagine,

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,130
there are different situations where you
use banner ads and interstitial ads.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,420
Since banner ads just covers a portion
of the screen, it allows the user to

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:15,020
engage with your app and see the ad
at the same time, while interstitial

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,270
ads take over the entire screen, so the
user can't see anything except the ad.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,960
>> How do we make money out of this?

7
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,250
>> I was just coming to that.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,010
As an app developer you can earn money

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,250
whenever you display an ad
in your app to a user.

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,300
Or if the user clicks on the ad.

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,400
So this is the way ads
can help you earn money.

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,920
And although, it sounds very easy,

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,520
you have to remember that you
need to create an awesome app, so

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,790
you have a big enough user base
looking and engaging with the ads.
