1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
So let's take a look at the types of partners.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,930
One of the most interesting concepts is strategic alliances.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:11,000
One of the concepts in start-ups that is important to remember

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,310
is this idea of the whole product.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,520
It turns out there is no possible way on day 1

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,670
that your start-up could provide a mainstream customer

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,240
with a complete solution; you just can't.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,050
You don't have enough time or money or resources

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,000
to fill out every possible thing someone in a Fortune-1000 company

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is going to put on a checklist or an RFP for you to provide.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,660
So the idea is to use strategic alliances

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,450
to complement your core product with other products or services.

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,390
It could be training, could be installation, could be service,

14
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,610
that is to surround your product with a cloud of other resources

15
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,900
to address mainstream customers.

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,690
For example, in 1996 Starbucks® partnered with Pepsi™

17
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,890
to bottle, distribute, and sell Frappuccino®,

18
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,760
which gave them access to Pepsi's™ enormous distribution channel.

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,940
Now, one word of caution.

20
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,940
You understand that the phrase I used was to develop the whole product,

21
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,300
to deliver a complete solution to mainstream customers.

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,470
The mistake start-ups often make is thinking

23
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,531
that they're selling to mainstream customers the day they first ship.

24
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:28,090
It turns out that for most start-ups not in an existing market,

25
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,380
you're not selling to mainstream customers,

26
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,410
you're selling to crazy people just like you.

27
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:38,190
It turns out that those people, which we called earlyvangelists,

28
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:43,010
are more than happy to assemble the complete solution themselves,

29
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,460
so all the bus-dev activities that start-ups scramble to get ready

30
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,380
by first customer ship actually could be deferred in most ventures

31
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,630
to actually after you got those first earlyvangelist customers

32
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,630
because it's the earlyvangelists who will, once they build the product themselves,

33
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,410
actually tell you what the complete feature set is.

34
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,820
So, think about strategic alliances.

35
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,110
Don't just checklist "I need a head of bus-dev

36
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,430
and all these solutions on day 1."

37
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,560
Think about what order they come in.
