00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,740
Alright, enough about bears. Now, I'm going to get back to the

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,630
question that we started this unit with and ended the previous

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,820
unit with, which is where those mysterious magic methods came from

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,660
when we didn't define them. Recall that we defined our restaurant

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,610
class like this and for now, we don't need any other

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,130
definitions. Because we saw before we even had any methods that

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,680
we got some behaviors, we got initialization and we got printing

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,178
using the magical --str-- method. So, the question is, what's going on?

9
00:00:25,178 --> 00:00:27,184
So, the choices are something magical and,

10
00:00:27,184 --> 00:00:29,850
and mysterious, and I'll tell you not to

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,175
select this one. Restaurant is inheriting this

12
00:00:33,175 --> 00:00:35,460
--str-- method from object and it's being called,

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,700
when we do the print, with a

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,970
restaurant instance and restaurant inherits the --str-- method

15
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,290
from object, and it's being called with

16
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,690
an object instance. Check all the true answers.
