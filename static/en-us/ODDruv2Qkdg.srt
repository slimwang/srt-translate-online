00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,670
Who has more shoes, men or women? I asked this question to everyone at Udacity.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,250
If you'd like, you can take the poll yourself and give us more data to work

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,382
with. We're going to do a t-test to see if men or women have more shoes. Our

4
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:17,547
null hypothesis is that there's no difference. The mean number of shoes owned

5
00:00:17,547 --> 00:00:22,780
by females, is equal to the mean number of shoes owned by males. Or that the

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,343
difference is 0. Which gender do you think has more shoes? That will determine

7
00:00:27,343 --> 00:00:32,101
our alternative hypothesis. One alternative hypothesis could be that females

8
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:36,394
own less shoes than males. Or that if we subtract the number of shoes owned by

9
00:00:36,394 --> 00:00:40,540
males by the number of shoes owned by females. We get a negative number. Or

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,005
maybe we think that females own more pairs of shoes than males, in which case

11
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:47,030
the difference will be positive, if we go in this direction for the

12
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:52,915
subtraction. And if we don't have a guess, then our alternative hypothesis will

13
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:57,420
be that they're different. The difference is not significantly equal to 0.

14
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,270
Let's go with this alternative. I know a lot of guys who have a lot of shoes.

15
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,680
And I also know a lot of girls that have a lot of shoes.
