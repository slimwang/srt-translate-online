1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,310
It was awesome, seeing all those users in those interviews

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,924
because, as developers, when we write code, we just commit

3
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:08,670
it to, some repository and we don't actually get to

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,620
see end users actually use the products that we make.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,660
>> Yeah, it's interesting to hear them describe the things

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,180
they like and don't like about applications in their own words.

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:16,670
>> Yeah, exactly.

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,640
>> I thought it was really cool that, although,

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,620
those users were very different they seemed to have a

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,570
lot of things in common. I know. We're going to have

11
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,324
a lot of fun, talking about this in Lesson Two.
