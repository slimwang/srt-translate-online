1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is actually no.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We haven't done enough yet to provide authentication.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And as I've described it, it's not the full EKE protocol.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The reason that it's not is the way to authenticate

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
depends on proving that you have the same key.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
To authenticate, what Alice needs to prove to the server

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
is that it knows the password, p, and the server needs to prove to Alice

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
that it knows that password, p.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Our assumption is that the password is shared between the client and the server--

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
in this case, Alice and the server--

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and the way to authenticate is to prove knowledge of that password.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In this case, that's not done--that we've just established a key.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That doesn't prove anything.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This message could have been anything.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The fact that Alice can decrypt it using the password

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
doesn't prove that Bob knew the password.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
To do that, we need to add an extra challenge to this.
