1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,710
So here's the code that will do this for
you.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,671
mLastLocation is set up by
getting the last location

3
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:10,277
from the FusedLocationApi for
the API client.

4
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:14,770
You simply say
LocationServices.FusedLocationApi.getLa-

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,800
stLocation and then passive the client.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,240
This has getLatitude and getLongitude
properties, which will return a double.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,260
So you can just call these and
then convert that to a string,

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,830
with String.valuieOf and
then set the text of labels accordingly.
