1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Here's my solution. First, I use randint to assign the true location of the car.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My initial guess, called guess1, is also chosen at random.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You see these independent random choices with equal probability.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now there are two possibilities. Either truth is equivalent to guess or it isn't.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
When truth is equivalent to guess, Monty will pick one of the two other doors.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's just implement this. I will let Monty pick a random door using randint.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Of course, he might have picked the correct door, which contains the car,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
which is also my guess, and when that's the case I just rerun the random number generator

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
until it finally finds a door that is not the true door or equivalently not the guess.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That this pick. If we look carefully, this might run a number of times.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But when it returns, he picked one of the remaining doors at 50% chance.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In the else clause, the truth and my guess are not the same.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So, Monty now has to pick the remaining door with probability 1.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How do we get get Monty's choice?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now I'm going to do a little cute trick.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I know that the sum of all doors--1 + 2 + 3--equals 6.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If I subtract from 6 the truth and my guess, I get the third door.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This equation--6 - truth - guess--will give us the number of the door that isn't truth

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and isn't guess 1.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
To flip my door, I can now do the same trick I did over here.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I pick the one that wasn't my initial guess, which is subtract guess1 from 6,

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
pick the one that isn't Monty. That gives me guess 2.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If that guess is the same as the 2 door, I increment k by 1.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Then I return the final number over here.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This gives me a single simulation.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I run through this n times.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So, I added a loop for i in range n, move everything to the right a little bit,

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and then this simulation is run n times,

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
returning my desired ratio of the successes over the total number of experiments.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's run it.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
When I run it 1000 times, I get a number like 0.672.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's not exactly 2.3, but obviously there is some randomness involved in the simulation.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If I increase N to 10,000, I get a number slightly closer to 0.66.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Do it 400,000, I get 0.66748.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That is awfully close to 2/3.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's really interesting to see that the switching helps.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Put differently, say I use guess1 as my final guess to compare to the truth

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
as opposed to guess2 and run this.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I get 0.331.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The interesting thing about guess1 is--the reason why it works is--

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
all the code from if truth all the way to here--guess2--is now irrelevant.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I can comment all of this out here in the middle, which I've just done,

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and just retain the assignment of the truth, which is a random number,

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the assignment of guess1, which is a random number,

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and then I just check where these two agree.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Clearly, the probability must be a 1/3.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
All this story about showing the open door has no effect on this.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That little thing here that I simulated and when I retained the original guess

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
then all the story about opening the door has no effect on the chances of my guess,

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
prove that the chance is to be 1/3 for the original door.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Therefore, switching goes up to 2/3.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Isn't that cool?

53
00:03:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the story of Monty Hall and the very famous quiz.
