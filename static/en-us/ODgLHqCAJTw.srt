Hi.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,330
I'm Cameron Pittman.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,750
>> And I'm James Williams.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,720
>> We're here to help you
get started with JavaScript,

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,320
the defacto programming
language of the Web.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,059
>> Now, you won't be a JavaScript
ninja when all is said and done.

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,587
But you will have enough knowledge to
start writing your own scripts and

8
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:22,010
resources, to figure out
what you don't know.
