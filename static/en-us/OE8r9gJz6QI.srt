00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,075
Now we've presented our
DiceViewController in three different

2
00:00:03,075 --> 00:00:08,060
ways; programatically, using
a combination of code and Storyboard,

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,970
and entirely in Storyboard.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,130
Recall that in the first solution,
the incoming instance of

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,820
DiceViewController is
manipulated directly.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,330
The current view controller has a chance
to prepare the incoming view controller

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,090
and what did that preparation involve?

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,850
The roll view controller sets the two
dice values on the dice view controller.

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,340
When we use a segue the dice view
controller never makes an appearance in

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,340
our code because story board
hides the creation of the object.

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,000
So now we need a new hook to allow
communication between the two view

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,740
controllers.

13
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,610
The method we need is
called prepareForSegue.

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,840
All view controllers
inherit this method and

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,060
it's invoked right before
any segue is performed.

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,340
Its entire purpose is to allow
the current view controller to configure

17
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,270
the incoming object.
