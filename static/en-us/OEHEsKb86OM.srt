00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,300
This course has five lessons that
are depicted in this course map.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,360
But, before we dive into them,

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,620
it's important to have a firm
understanding of network basics.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,860
So, we're going to start with
what I'm calling lesson zero.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,820
In this lesson, we're going to
talk about how apps send and

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,730
receive data over the network.

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,800
Then, we'll show you how to implement
this concept in iOS, using Swift.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,960
We'll do this by building a very
simple app that downloads an image

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,230
over the network and
displays it to users.

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,190
Also as we go through the lesson,
we'll be keeping track of terms and

11
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,570
concepts in a concept list to
help us keep everything straight.

12
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,110
You'll see it in just a minute.

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,640
Let's get started by
inspecting some popular apps.
