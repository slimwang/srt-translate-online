1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,890
Now that we have a derived feature x, before we go on to making

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:11,020
Kernel density estimates, let's look at a simple histogram of this feature x.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,040
Let's switch to our IPython notebooks.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,000
In te block of code here in the IPython notebook,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,750
we have defined the variable x.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,860
We are going to bin it between zero and one, with 100 bins.

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,450
We are not going to normalize it so we can look at the number of entries.

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,630
Let's run this piece of code.

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,880
Once the code has finished running,

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,640
you will see a histogram that looks like this.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,390
This is our variable of interest x.
