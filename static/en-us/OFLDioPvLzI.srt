00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,040
Since we've talked about several situations now that involve two different

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,820
variables or two quantities that we might want to relate to one another in an

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,725
equation. I think we should review what equations with two variables really

4
00:00:11,725 --> 00:00:17,148
mean. Now, I gave you this exact quiz way, way back in Lesson 5-1. But looking

5
00:00:17,148 --> 00:00:21,730
at it again might refresh our memories a bit. So, what can an equation with two

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,230
variables do? Can it describe mathematical relationship between two variables?

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,433
Can it show the output for a given input? Can it show how changing one quantity

8
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:34,766
changes another quantity? Or can it demonstrate cause and effect? Please pick as

9
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:37,456
many of these answers as you think are correct.
