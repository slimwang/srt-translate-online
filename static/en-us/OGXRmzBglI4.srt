00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,900
I'm Mike Wells and
this is my bad interview experience.

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,700
So during an interview one time,

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,510
I was given 15 minutes to write
the computer side of tic tac toe.

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,870
A function that would
play the computer side.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,570
Now I play tic tac toe
a lot with my kids.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,520
And we all know, if you get
three corners, you win the game.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,340
So that's what I approached it as, and
I'm standing at the white board and

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,210
I keep mumbling to myself just
get three corners and I win.

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,080
I'm telling the interviewer if
I get three corners, I win.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,455
And I wasted fifteen minutes trying to
win the game of tic tac toe and, at

11
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:45,335
the end, I didn't even have a function
that would play the game of tic tac toe.

12
00:00:45,335 --> 00:00:46,075
It was horrible.

13
00:00:46,075 --> 00:00:46,915
It wouldn't even run.

14
00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:51,645
It would have been better for
me to just write a function that would

15
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:54,085
put an X in the very
first available slot.

16
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:56,175
Instead, I'm too worried about
winning and winning and winning.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,660
I walked away from that, and

18
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,940
I had a friend who interviewed at
the same company, and I was like, dude,

19
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,269
I had this question, and
I didn't do very well.

20
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,350
And he laughed about it,
and he reassured me.

21
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,940
He said, I bombed it as well the first
time and then we sat down and

22
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,400
worked through another solution
that not only played the game, but

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,460
also played it very well.

24
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,490
So that was fun and I get to learn
a little bit from the process as well.
