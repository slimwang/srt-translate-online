Well, this time you're going to get similar answers.

00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:06,810
The big difference is that the maximum number of threads per SM is now 1536.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,136
All these other numbers are the same. The maximum number of registers per SM is still 64K.

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,653
The maximum amount of shared memory per SM is still 48K.

5
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:18,186
The maximum number of thread blocks per SM is 8.

6
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:22,224
So we have the same limiting factor, which is the maximum of threads per SM,

7
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:27,697
but now the answer is a little different. Now we can only run a single thread block per SM,

8
00:00:27,697 --> 00:00:33,267
and that means our total number of threads per SM will be 1024.
