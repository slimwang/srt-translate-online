1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,130
So, in particular, the way I heard you write it down was that

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:10,070
A must consider the sort of worst case counter strategy by B right?

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,330
>> I see, because when A chooses the row, then B was going to

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,150
make things bad for A along that row, so that's the counter strategy you mean.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,910
>> Right, and in fact, when you try to do it the other way with B. Well,

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,720
B has to do the same thing. B has to consider the worst case counter, as well.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,440
And in this particular case, the way we set it up.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,070
Where the values for A. A is always therefore trying to maximize.

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,410
And B is always trying to minimize A. Which works out

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,100
to be the same thing as maximizing itself. Does that make sense?

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,870
>> Yeah! I mean, other than the fact that, you know, I name

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,795
my first child Max. I really wanted to name my second child Min.

13
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:47,640
>> [LAUGH] That actually would have been pretty cool. Why didnt you do that?

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,720
>> Because I'm married to someone with more sense then i have.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,100
>> Yeah i understand, i completely understand. Okay so, A is

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,510
trying to maximize B is trying to minimize they both have

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,140
to consider the worst case that the other will do. And

18
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,930
so whats thats going to is going to force them through exactly

19
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,270
the same process you went through. We just figure, I'm going to

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,630
make the choice so that my opponent makes the counter choice,

21
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,920
the worst case choice. I will end up as best as

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,110
I can. So A is going to basically try to find the

23
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,370
maximum minimum, and B is trying to find the minimum maximum.

24
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:19,620
>> Hmm

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,170
>> In fact that strategy has a name, or that way of

26
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,280
thinking about it has a name. What do you think it's called?

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,360
>> The minimum, maximum.

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,190
>> Yes, or Mini max.

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,560
>> Which is movie production company, I think.

30
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,790
>> No, that was Miramax. Do you recall

31
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,330
that where you have seen Mini max before

32
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,100
Michael? In some other class that you once

33
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,920
taught or once took years and years ago?

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,480
>> Mmm. No.

35
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,290
>> Mini max was exactly the algorythm that

36
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,470
we use for game search. And intro to AI.

37
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,960
>> Oh, which was a game tree, which is just what we

38
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,880
started with in this case. Even though we turned it into a matrix.

39
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,780
>> Exactly. So

40
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,180
in the end, we, you know, this matrix induces a game tree, if you want to

41
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,810
think about it that way. Or, game tree

42
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,500
induces a matrix, if you want to think about

43
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,990
it that way. And the strategy then, in sort of basic AI search, and the strategy

44
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,090
in game theory is Minimax when you're in

45
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,440
a two player zero sum game of perfect information.

46
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,570
>> So is there a way to do alpha beta pruning on this?

47
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,800
>> All alpha beta pruning does is gives you a more efficient

48
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,700
way of finding the answer.

49
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,180
>> I see but it's the same answer no matter how you set it up.

50
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,840
>> Right. Cool.

51
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,070
>> That's right. Okay, so this is pretty cool.

52
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,410
So, we have set up a kind of game

53
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,810
where we have multiple agents, you know, or at

54
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,860
least two agents in this case, who have different

55
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,950
strategies. And we actually sort of know, [SOUND], you

56
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,360
know, sort of, in a world where it's a

57
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,480
zero sum game, and you know the other person

58
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,190
is trying to minimize what you get, maximize what

59
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,280
they get. That the mini-max strategy would actually

60
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,900
give you sort of an answer, in this

61
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,650
case, by the way. We say that the value of this game for a is three.

62
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,070
If a does the rational thing, and b does the rational thing, that is trying to

63
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,600
maximize their own value, you will end up

64
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,790
in this situation. That's kind of cool, don't you think?

65
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,950
>> Very cool. I feel like there should be a theorem.

66
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,320
>> There is in fact a theorem. I'm going to write it down.
