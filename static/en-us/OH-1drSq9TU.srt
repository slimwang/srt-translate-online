00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So here's the goal of secure computation. Let's suppose Alice and Bob meet at a conference.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
They don't yet know each other despite the fact that they've been talking to each other

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
through units 1 through 6, but let's pretend they're not quite so friendly yet,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and they both have their smart phones.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
On their smart phone, they have an address book.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What they want to do is figure out, do they know any of the same people?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is a pretty common occurrence at conferences.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Often, the way people do this is the slow, "Were you ever at this place?"

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
"Do you know someone here?" "Do you know anyone there?"

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
They want to do it more efficiently, so what they'd like to do is have a protocol

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that allows them to compare their address books and find all the people they know in common.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In this case, it would match Dennis since they both know the same Dennis and then they would

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
see the matches but not reveal anything else about their address book to the other person.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
They want to do this by executing some protocol

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
where at the end of the protocol both parties would know the matching entries

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
but not learn anything else about the other person's address book.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
More generally, we have two parties - A and B. They have some private information.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
They want to perform some secure computation,

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and at the end of that they learn the result of some function on both of their inputs,

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
but they don't learn anything about the other party's input.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now it's time for a question.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's sort of a trick question, but if you were paying attention at the beginning of this unit,

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
you'll be able to answer it correctly.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Can we achieve this property using cryptography?
