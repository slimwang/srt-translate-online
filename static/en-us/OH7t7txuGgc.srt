00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,240
Interesting question is sort of what is the state of the art

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,100
in computer vision now?

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,490
What are things that are people doing with computer vision?

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,510
How might that compare a little bit to the way humans do vision?

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,070
Here is a, a simple example of stuff that, fact used to be sort of considered to

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,110
be difficult, but is actually now pretty standard.

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,620
So let's talk about simple optical character recognition.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,160
So here's an example from some license plate readers.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,240
And license plates are somewhat easier because there's a fixed font.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,520
In fact, not that long ago doing OCR was considered very hard.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,302
Today if you have a scanner, or

12
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:35,469
if you have Adobe Acrobat, it comes with OCR built in.

13
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,850
Because that's how ubiquitous and sort of easy it is.

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,301
A little more challenging,

15
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:42,510
many of you may have started using automated teller machines.

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,481
Where you can deposit bank checks with hand written numbers that are the amount.

17
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:52,206
And also, for quite a while the Post Office has been recognizing the ZIP

18
00:00:52,206 --> 00:00:54,310
codes using, machines.

19
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,290
Again, on handwritten envelopes.

20
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,570
So that's an example of computer vision extracting the meaning.

21
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,690
What are the numbers that are there?

22
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,950
Another thing that's very common these days is face detection.

23
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,480
Just about any digital camera that you buy today, you pick it up,

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,140
using the default setting, it will find the faces.

25
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,600
So, here's an example.

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,210
One of the cool things, by the way, is bunch of lectures in the future,

27
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,290
we'll talk about the technology that basically does exactly this.

28
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,910
So the next time, so when we get to those, you pick up a camera and

29
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,180
it finds the faces.

30
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,970
You'll say, oh, I know how they're doing that.

31
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,210
But actually now, cameras can do more.

32
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,210
I think the one on the left, I think is from the web,

33
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,170
from Fiji, that if you take a picture of somebody, and they blink.

34
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,930
You know, and that can be really annoying, it'll tell you they blinked.

35
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,860
Maybe even more interestingly, Sony has something called the Smile Shutter,

36
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,210
which will watch for people.

37
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,820
And you sort of press it, and say, take a picture now.

38
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,320
But actually it waits until you, it sees the person smile.

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,650
And even further these days, there are cameras that will recognize who you are.

40
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,380
So this is a screen taken from a shot where it does camera based login.

41
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,530
So it knows about a bunch of different people.

42
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,521
You walk up to the computer, you say, yo, computer it's me.

43
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:03,210
Actually you don't have to say anything, and the computer says, it's you.

44
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,210
And it logs you in.

45
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,840
So that's face recognition.

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,880
We're going to talk also, a little bit, about face recognition.

47
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,699
Although the face detection stuff techno,

48
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,880
that technology is one that will be sort of more fundamental to the class.
