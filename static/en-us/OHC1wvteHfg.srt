1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So this first one is actually false.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We don't know that the shortest tour for the input graph has length 1056.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's the smallest one that we happen to have found,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
but if we ran the algorithm numerous more times,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
then we might find a smaller one,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and the only thing we know for certain is that

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the minimal vertex cover is at least 618

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
because of our factor 2 approximation.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We also don't know that the random algorithm is likely a factor 3 approximation,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
again because we would need to run it

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
many, many more times to really be certain of that.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now we have found a tour that is at most

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
1.71 times as long as the optimal one

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
because we found a tour of length 1056,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and we know that the optimal one is at least 618,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
which is 1.71.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now we have not found a tour that is at most

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
1.43 times as long as the optimal one,

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and if we plug that into our previous equation and we solve it for X,

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
then we would get X equals 1.43 times 618,

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
which is about 883,

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
which we didn't find a tour of 883.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So that is not true.
