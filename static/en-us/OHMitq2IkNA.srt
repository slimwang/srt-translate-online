00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:01,479
Hey Tommy, what do you think of our app?

2
00:00:01,479 --> 00:00:04,551
>> Yeah, look, you can even put
your paw on this red paw button.

3
00:00:04,551 --> 00:00:06,248
>> And if you want,
we can add you to it too.

4
00:00:06,248 --> 00:00:10,417
>> Yeah,
I don't think he's a fan of our app.

5
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:12,890
>> Man, Tommy,
why do you have such high standards?

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:13,942
>> I don't know.

7
00:00:13,942 --> 00:00:16,567
This just means we need to step
up our game in the next lesson.

8
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:21,027
>> Actually, speaking of which, we had
a problem with the previous lesson.

9
00:00:21,027 --> 00:00:23,118
>> What, then why did we teach it?

10
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,311
>> Well, we don't want to directly call
the SQLite database like we're doing

11
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:28,110
right now from an activity code.

12
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,350
because that's just an easy
way to introduce bugs.

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,728
because for example,
if we were to have a typo in activity,

14
00:00:32,728 --> 00:00:35,182
that would just insert invalid
data into the database.

15
00:00:35,182 --> 00:00:36,147
>> I guess so.

16
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:39,696
>> Well, how about in this lesson, we'll
be introducing a concept called content

17
00:00:39,696 --> 00:00:43,106
providers, which will act as a layer
between the database and the activity.

18
00:00:43,106 --> 00:00:45,667
So there's going to be a lot of
benefits to using content providers.

19
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:48,517
So one reason that we're going to be
using it in our app is to ensure that

20
00:00:48,517 --> 00:00:50,831
the data we're inserting
into the database is valid.

21
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:52,777
>> Okay, I think that makes sense then.

22
00:00:52,777 --> 00:00:54,130
Content providers then.

23
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,907
But we're going to have to introduce
things like URIs, UriMatcher,

24
00:00:57,907 --> 00:01:00,831
content resolver,
all of these different things.

25
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:02,419
Are you sure you want to cover all that?

26
00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:04,568
>> Yeah, absolutely,
I think our students are ready for that.

27
00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:06,260
And so is Tommy, right?

28
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,165
So content providers are going to help
us a lot later on when we want to take

29
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:12,175
advantage of other framework classes
to load data from a database

30
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:13,715
more smoothly into the UI.

31
00:01:13,715 --> 00:01:16,655
>> Yeah, the content provider works
well with those framework classes.

32
00:01:16,655 --> 00:01:18,043
I guess we should use it then.

33
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:18,706
Let's go for it.

34
00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:19,675
>> All right, let's go Tommy.
