1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,670
Now that you have a cluster
running it's time to test it out.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,340
You need to make sure everything
is running as it should.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,540
To test the cluster's processing
capability you can run terasort.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,710
Typically you test your cluster
on a terabyte or more data but

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,010
since you didn't provision that
much storage you'll do less.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,600
You'll have to type in
some long commands here.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,340
So like before I'll give you
the command so you can copy and paste.

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,300
First create a home folder for any data.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,500
Next you'll need to create some
random data for the terasort example.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,290
Teragen writes rows of
random data to a file.

11
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,220
Here are our random data.

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,681
Each row is 100 bytes long and
we have 500,000 rows.

13
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:40,780
So 50 megabytes in total.

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,180
Remember this is replicated
across the cluster so

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,140
it takes up 150 megabytes
across the three data nodes.

16
00:00:47,288 --> 00:00:51,270
Now run terasort on the data you
generated which will sort the data and

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,680
write it to a file sorted data
If the cluster was configured

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,790
properly everything should
have run without feeling.

19
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,370
Next, we can measure the input and
output IO speeds with test DFSIO.

20
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,410
This will write in removable
files to and from H.T.

21
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,460
F.S and record the average IO speeds for
these tasks.

22
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,890
Then to read files from disc.

23
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,670
The results are written to
test DFSIO results dot log.

24
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,890
If you want to view them later.
