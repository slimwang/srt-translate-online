00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this question I'm going to ask you about whether certain image functions are linear.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A function is linear if each resulting pixel of the processed image

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
is a linear combination of input pixels.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They could be weighted by constants like plus 1 or minus 1,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and they could be added up. Addition is linear.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But for example, taking the square of a pixel is a non-linear operation.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I realize this question goes beyond what we discussed in class,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
so please think a little bit about it and understand the difference

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
between linear and nonlinear in trying to answer these questions.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
First is our gradient kernel here: minus 1, 1.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Please check if it's linear or nonlinear.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Again, the linearity of an output image is given if the output image is a linear function

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
of the pixels in the input image.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
How about our Gaussian kernel that we discussed in class of size 5 by 5?

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Is the kernal linear or nonlinear?

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How would we take the absolute value of a pixel?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If pixels are negative, we just ignore the negative sign and map back to the absolute value.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Is it linear or nonlinear?

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We talked about the gradient magnitude kernel,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
which was defined over a square root of the squares of the image gradients.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Is this a linear or nonlinear operation.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Finally, if you were to calculate the absolute brightness of a grey-scale image,

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
or let me call this the average brightness.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We have an imager of a certain size and like to calculate just the average brightness

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
of all the individual image pixels. They are all in greyscale.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Is this linear or nonlinear?
