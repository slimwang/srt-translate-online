00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,450
Let's check out the features
of the My Favorite Movies app.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,470
When open the app we're presented
with this nice login screen and

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,890
the user is prompted for
their username and a password.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,760
I'll go ahead and
enter my credentials and log in.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,760
Once we're in were presented with this
tab control and it has four tabs.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,250
And the log out button is in
the top left hand corner.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,380
And on the first three tabs we have
the statically defined movie genres.

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,450
We have sci-fi, comedy, action.

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,350
And in any of these tabs there's 20
movies listed in no particular order.

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,400
Then on the last tab we have
our favorite movies list.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,000
For some of you,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,740
you may have no movies here if you
haven't favorited anything yet.

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,300
But as you can see I have three movies
here that I've already added to my list.

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,710
I happen to know that the movie
Fury is on the Action's tab and

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,080
this is a movie I just recently
watched and I really liked it.

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,490
So I want to add it to my favorites but
I need to select it here first.

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,060
Then on the detail view, I'll tap the
heart icon to add it to my favorites.

18
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,080
If we go back to our Favorites list.

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,620
There you can see Fury's
been added to the bottom.

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,600
What's happening here is when I
tapped the heart button here I

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,010
favorited the movie and
that data was posted to the server.

22
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,480
Then when I returned
to the Favorites tab

23
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,490
on a separate request that movie was
returned to my new favorites list.

24
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,400
It's pretty cool.

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,090
Now that you know what this app should
do when it's done the next step is to

26
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,830
figure out to use the movie
database to create this app.
