1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,760
For the first one,
Messages is the correct answer.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,590
This is very timely information and

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,740
it's not going to be relevant many hours
later, if the wearable is not connected.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,508
This one is Data Items.

5
00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:13,010
These are settings which would
be useful to store permanently

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,410
in case a new wearable
is paired up later on.

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,570
For this question,
the answer is Data Items.

8
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,810
While on a run, the wearable
might not have data connectivity.

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,470
So store it in the data layer to
ensure it will be synced up later on

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,890
when possible.

11
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,370
This one is Messages.

12
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,140
This is information which
is only relevant right now.

13
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,650
Later on it will not be useful, so

14
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,840
there's no need to store it
permanently in the data layer.

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,020
And for this question here,
the answer is Data Items.

16
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,870
This notification may be around for
a while, and it's important that it

17
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,820
shows up on the device,
even if it's not currently paired.

18
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,450
This cannot be lost, because it
might be important to the user.
