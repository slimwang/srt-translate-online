00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,142
One thing to notice about the last equation we had was that it had not just one

2
00:00:04,154 --> 00:00:08,318
variable but 2, n and d. Now thinking about the situation in which we develop

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,317
this equation, what do you think we can say about what an equation with two

4
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:16,315
variables can do? Pick as many as these answer down here as you think makes

5
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:16,636
sense.
