1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,490
Well, C is true but irrelevant.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,420
B is false but irrelevant.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,970
A is the correcting thing.

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,440
The imagery that you create by doing that reflection has the same statistics.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,780
And I guess I should have also written, no obvious edge induced.

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,410
Right? When I did that reflection,

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,810
it was actually hard to see where those edges were.
