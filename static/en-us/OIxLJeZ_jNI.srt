1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:06,740
And the answer is 0.57 over here and 0.43 over here.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,450
And the rationale is that the posteriors are normalized to 1.

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,942
So we've taken 0.04, for example, and

4
00:00:13,942 --> 00:00:20,060
dividing 0.04 by the total, which is 0.04 plus 0.03.

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,300
When you work this out, it's the same as 4 divided by 7, or 0.57.

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,630
And when you divide 3 by 7, you get 0.43.

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,950
That's the correct posterior answer in this example.
