While in development,

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,300
Service Workers can be a bit of
a pain to work with it first.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,490
So let me show you a few tips and
tricks.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,120
Generally, I work in
an incognito window.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,939
That way, I can be sure that each
time I close and reopen the window,

6
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:20,093
the Service Worker and anything stored
in the cache has been blown away and

7
00:00:20,093 --> 00:00:21,368
I'm starting fresh.

8
00:00:21,368 --> 00:00:27,297
Chrome://serviceworker-internals is
a super helpful tool.

9
00:00:27,297 --> 00:00:31,715
It'll show you all of the installed
Service Workers, their state,

10
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:34,930
allow you to update them or
get rid of them.

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,330
The open DevTools window and pause
JavaScript execution on Service Worker

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,390
start up for debugging is helpful if
you need to debug the install event or,

13
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,000
code that's run when
the Service Worker first wakes up.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,820
But be careful with it,

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,460
if you have multiple sites with
Service Workers installed it'll open for

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,670
every site, which can be a pain
when you're debugging one site.

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,620
When you open a page
that has a Service Worker

18
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,720
the browser spins up
that Service Worker.

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,070
Then if you open another page that falls
within the scope of that Service Worker,

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,710
the browser doesn't spin up another
Service Worker it uses the same one.

21
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,130
That means if you have multiple tabs or

22
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,640
windows open there's
only one Service Worker.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,630
But what happens when you
update the Service Worker?

24
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,010
The new Service Worker sits idle waiting

25
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,330
until all of the windows that used
the previous Service Worker have closed.

26
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,790
Check out the skip waiting and
client's claim for a way to avoid this.

27
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,430
In addition to the Service Workers
internal page,

28
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,640
you can also use the Resources tab

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,900
in the Chrome DevTools to see what's
going on with your Service Worker.

30
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,310
It also gives you access to the cache.

31
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,610
So you can verify everything
was cached properly.

32
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,860
Finally, if you didn't use
an incognito window and

33
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,135
you want to get rid of everything,
you can use,

34
00:01:56,135 --> 00:02:01,960
chrome//settings/cookies and
remove everything there.
