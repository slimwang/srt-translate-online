00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,040
We're now going to look at the confusion matrix.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,010
It is important to know that selecting a model is dependent on

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,100
the problem being considered and the application of the model.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:12,650
Often for

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,740
practical problems, we're interested in measures other than just accuracy.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,630
Let us consider a kind of contrived example.

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,530
We have many bottles of wine, where some are poisoned.

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,290
In this case,

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:33,020
it is important that we always catch the bottles of wine that are poisoned.

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,830
So labeling a good bottle of wine as poisoned, which is a false negative,

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,980
implies some wasted wine.

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,590
However, labeling a poisoned bottle as good,

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,960
which is a false negative, can imply a far dangerous mistake.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,280
So, in this case, we can sacrifice accuracy for some other measure where we give

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,050
a lot more value at minimizing the false negatives versus the false positives.

16
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,850
Here is a quick quiz.

17
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,590
Give an example of a classification problem where the cost of

18
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,320
a false positive outweighs the cost of a false negative.

00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,440
