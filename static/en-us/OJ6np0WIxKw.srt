00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,730
I've started out by just writing L2 minus L1. And we can notice that both of

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,986
these have a factor of 10. So let's just go ahead and pull that out. So

3
00:00:09,986 --> 00:00:15,640
factoring out that 10 and then also distributing this minus sign to both terms

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:21,610
inside the second parenthesis, gives us this. 10 times log of 2P minus log of

5
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:28,470
B. Minus log of P plus log of B. Something that pops out in this expression is

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,920
that we have a minus log of B and a plus log of B. So these two things are

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,910
going to cancel each other out, awesome. That's how we get rid of that B and

8
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,620
that's why we didn't need to know its actual value. Looking at what this

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,250
equations reduces to then, we can see how much simpler everything is. We still

10
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,000
however have another variable left in here. What do we do with this P? Well I

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,700
think that we have to bring back our quotient rule again. But this time we are

12
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,480
going to use it in the reverse order from how we did before. We're going to

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,090
condense this expression into just a single log. This gives us 10 times log

14
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:12,130
base 10 of 2P over P. Well, and look at that, if we divide 2P by P, these Ps

15
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,255
just cancel each other out. That's going to leave us with something super easy.

16
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:19,749
10 times log base 10 of 2. This is just a number, let's use the calculator to

17
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:21,759
evaluate this. We have 10 times log base 10 of 2. That's equal to 3.01 etc.

18
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:37,794
Which I'm going to round to just 3, so our answer is about 3 decibels.
