00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Evans] The answer is the second choice.

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If a guest checks in but never enters the room, here's what goes wrong.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If Alice never enters the room, then the next guest--who's very tall--

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
who checks in, she'll get a key that is the next value here,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which is going to be hashing m - 2 times,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but the value of the stored x is still hash of m + 1,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and that means the value of hashing of the hashing this new key

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
will only be the hash of m, which won't match the value of x.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So the new guest won't be able to open the door.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The hotel operator would need to do something to reset the value of n

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
or resynchronize the door and the check-in.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And apparently, the hotels that adopted this way of doing keying

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
never imagined the possibility that a guest would check in

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but never actually enter their room with their key.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Apparently, this happens more often than you might think, though.
