1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,995
>> We see from this lesson that there are a variety of different treatment options

2
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:05,082
for psychological disorders.

3
00:00:05,082 --> 00:00:08,808
>> Psychologists from a biological perspective may use drugs or psychosurgeries as

4
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,645
a treatment option.

5
00:00:10,645 --> 00:00:13,895
>> Whereas, some psychologists may favor psychotherapies, such as behavioral

6
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:18,580
therapy, cognitive therapy, or even humanistic therapy for treatment.

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,716
>> And given that so many of these treatments are effective and have evidence to

8
00:00:21,716 --> 00:00:26,566
support them. Many psychologists favor combining them. So for instance, we can

9
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:29,294
combine cognitive behavioral therapy, with drug therapy to treat a lot of

10
00:00:29,294 --> 00:00:31,365
different kinds of disorders.

11
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,023
>> And we also see that mind and space meditation is rising in popularity for a

12
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:38,445
treatment option of disorders such as depression, anxiety, and even

13
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:44,345
schizophrenia. In addition, if you remember our lesson on consciousness, you'll

14
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:47,383
recall that there are other positive benefits to mindfulness meditation

15
00:00:47,383 --> 00:00:52,565
including decreased overall stress levels as well as improved mood. So it'll be

16
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:55,400
interesting to see in the years to come what further research tells us about

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,200
mindfulness based meditation.

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,400
>> And finally, we see that by using a variety of these techniques, a person with

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,450
a mental disorder can live a completely full, happy, productive and very

20
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,350
enjoyable life, which is great news for all of us.
