1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,230
The UINavigationController manages
a stack of UI View Controllers.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,870
As such, you can have as many
View Controllers as your app needs.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,510
You need at least one View Controller,

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,010
and you can add as many as
it makes sense for your app.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,470
You can always add and

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,400
remove View Controllers from
a UI View Controller stack.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,740
Note that this is in stark contrast to
the UI tab bar controller you will learn

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,880
about later in the course, that manages
a fixed set of UI View controllers.
