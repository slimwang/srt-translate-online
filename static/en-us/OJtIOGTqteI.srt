1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,368
These should have given 42, 16 and 4. This last one should have surprised you

2
00:00:07,368 --> 00:00:10,443
if you haven't coded before. Mostly Java follows the same rules that you learn

3
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:19,392
in algebra. Here x is 3 and y is 4. Multiplication happens before addition and

4
00:00:19,392 --> 00:00:26,400
then we add 4 to 3 and get 7. 2 and 4 gives us 6 and we multiply it to get 42.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,136
It's possible that your algebra sense took over here and you read xy as x times

6
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:39,320
y. But it should actually be 11 because xy is a variable. Then y over 2 and 3,

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:47,287
3 and 2 and 11 gives us 16. For this last one it kind of looks like Java just

8
00:00:47,287 --> 00:00:54,550
miscalculated. I would've expected this to be 4 plus 5, which is 9 over 2.

9
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,650
Which would be 4.5. Let's go back to [UNKNOWN]

10
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,810
to talk about what happened.
