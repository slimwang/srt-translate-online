1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,840
Third strategy is mediators. In mediator situation,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,420
a new implementation element is introduced for

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,480
each invariant. And it's called a Mediator. Each Mediator is responsible for

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,310
maintaining one invariant. And knows what the dependent components are.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,320
The independent event receiving component knows only that they

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,360
must inform the mediator, when their attributes change value. For example,

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,270
when the Scrollbar is adjusted, it alerts the relevant Mediator. Which in turn,

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,560
requests the new position from the Scrollbar. The Mediator realizes the new

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,320
content is required from the FileManager. Requests it, and pass it

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,580
to the ViewPort. That is each Mediator has knowledge and responsibility for

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,110
the maintain, maintenance of one invariant. And by the way, Mediator is

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,300
an example of a design pattern. Which we will explore later in the course.
