00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,410
In 1988, Michael Kearns and Leslie
Valiant posed the following question.

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:10,400
Can a set of weak learners be combined
to create a single, strong learner?

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,279
One answer to that
question came in 2009.

4
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,783
Back in 2006,
Netflix offered a $1 million prize for

5
00:00:18,783 --> 00:00:22,988
a machine learning algorithm that
could do 10% better than their own

6
00:00:22,988 --> 00:00:27,350
algorithm at predicting which movies
their customers would like to see.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,033
The prize was not awarded until
three years later in 2009.

8
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:37,905
The winning algorithm was not a single
algorithm, but a combination of several,

9
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:39,500
or an ensemble.

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,940
This lesson is about ensemble learners.
