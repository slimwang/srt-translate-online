1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We have already covered the lowest harvest rate of 2.0 * 10⁵ tons per year,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and we saw that we have a problem with over fishing if we are below this equilibrium point.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If we are above that equilibrium point, the amount of fish will not decrease to zero.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
For the lower value, it depends. Namely, it depends on the initial amount of fish.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The upper harvest rate clearly amounts to over fishing independent of the initial amount of fish.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The loss is always larger than the gain.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In this case, we surely have the situation that the amount of fish decreases to zero.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If we use this harvest rate that just touches the peak of our gain graph,

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
things get a little tricky.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If we start with an amount of fish that's below 1 million tons, we lose more than we gain per time,

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
which means that the amount of fish is going to become zero eventually

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If we are in the region above 1million tons also the loss is larger than the gain

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
so we are moving towards lower amounts,

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but in principle, we would be stopping at this equilibrium point where the loss equals the gain.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is what would be called semi-stable equilibrium.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
On the one side, it is unstable and on the other side it's stable,

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
but imagine what happens if we have eventually reached this equilibrium from the other side,

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
just a tiny disturbance would suffice to make you drop down to the left end of that graph.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Almost surely the amount of fish will decrease to zero if we pick the rate of 2.5*10⁵ tons per year.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And this rate is called the maximum sustainable yield.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In theory, you could be harvesting at this rate forever and ever,

22
00:01:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but of course, that's pretty dangerous whenever there's this largest disturbance.
