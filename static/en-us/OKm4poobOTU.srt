00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,505
>> The answer here is y equals negative 3 halves x plus 7 halves. Now remember,

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:09,486
just because you see fractions, doesn't mean it's wrong. Let's see how we got

3
00:00:09,486 --> 00:00:14,505
that answer. Again, this is a two-part question. First, we have to find the

4
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:19,955
slope. And then, we have to find the equation. So, first, let's find the slope.

5
00:00:19,955 --> 00:00:26,387
I know the equation of slope is y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1. I'm going to go

6
00:00:26,387 --> 00:00:34,126
ahead and label my points, this is x1, y1 and this is x2, y2. Again, this helps

7
00:00:34,126 --> 00:00:41,904
me make sure I put the numbers in the right places. So, the slope y2 is negative

8
00:00:41,904 --> 00:00:49,224
1 minus y1, which is 2, over x2, which is 3 minus x1, which is 1. So, we have

9
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:56,167
negative 1 minus 2 is negative 3 over 3 minus 1 is 2. So, we know the slope is

10
00:00:56,167 --> 00:01:02,883
negative 3 halves, which is why you see negative 3 halves x in the equation.

11
00:01:02,883 --> 00:01:10,204
But, how did we get 7 halves? There's a couple different ways to do this. We

12
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:17,225
also know that the slope is equal to y minus y1 over x minus x1. So, our slope

13
00:01:17,225 --> 00:01:23,605
was negative 3 halves and that's going to equal y minus y1, y minus 2 over x

14
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:30,423
minus x 1, which is 1. And again, I can cross multiply. When I cross multiply, I

15
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:36,226
have negative 3 times x minus 1 equals 2 times y minus 2. Now, I have to

16
00:01:36,226 --> 00:01:43,178
distribute. After I distribute, I have negative 3x. Negative 3 times negative 1

17
00:01:43,178 --> 00:01:49,625
is positive 3 equals 2y. 2 times negative 2 is negative 4. To put this in slop-

18
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:55,763
intercept form, to put this equation in slope-intercept form, the first thing

19
00:01:55,763 --> 00:02:01,343
I'm going to do is subtract 3 from both sides, and I get negative 3x equals 2y

20
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:08,037
minus 7. If I just go ahead and add 4 to both sides, I get negative 3x plus 7

21
00:02:08,037 --> 00:02:17,167
equals 2y. And I can still divide everything through by 2. And I get y equals

22
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:24,860
negative 3 halves x plus 7 halves. And we know that negative 3 halves x plus 7

23
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,603
halves equals y, is the same as y equals negative 3 halves x plus 7 halves. Now,

24
00:02:30,603 --> 00:02:36,987
we're going to try a couple of problems with parallel and perpendicular lines.
