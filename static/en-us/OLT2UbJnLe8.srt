1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So what's the running time of this going to be?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Is it (logn) like the other heap operations we've been looking at?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Is it θ(n)?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Is it θ(nlogn),

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
which I had said most sorting can be done in (nlogn),

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but it's not clear if this actually achieves that.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Or is it more like (n₂)?
