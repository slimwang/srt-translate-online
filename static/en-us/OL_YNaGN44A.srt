1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,350
Here, the only values of m that make the inequality true are in interval II.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,240
The numbers between negative 2 3rds and positive 5. In the first interval, we

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,564
can test the number that's less than negative 2 3rds. Well, negative 1 is less

4
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:19,220
than negative 2 3rds. We know this since negative 1 can be rewritten as

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,040
negative 3 3rds. We want to plug in negative 1 instead of negative 3 3rds,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,080
since it's easier to work with an integer than it is with a fraction.

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,778
Substituting the value of negative 1, m for m. We get the inequality statement

8
00:00:31,778 --> 00:00:36,376
that 6 is less than or equal to 0. We know this isn't true, so interval I is

9
00:00:36,376 --> 00:00:41,830
false. Next, we want to test the value in interval II. I think the easiest

10
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:46,625
value to test in this region would be 0. When we plug in 0 for m, we lose these

11
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:52,760
two terms to get negative 10 is less than or equal to 0, which we know is true.

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,102
So yes, these values can be included in our solution set. And finally, we test

13
00:00:57,102 --> 00:01:02,226
a number in interval III. I'm going to use the number 6. You could of course

14
00:01:02,226 --> 00:01:05,990
use other numbers, 10 would have been another great one to use. Plugging in 6

15
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,490
in for m will get the inequality 20 is less than or equal to 0. This isn't

16
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,740
true, so we know that this part is not included in our solution set.
