Hi, I'm Peter Chapman.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Last semester I TA'd for CS101 where we built the search engine.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This time around, we're going to build a web browser

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
using the power of programming languages in CS262.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When I'm not working on my start-up search engine, searchwithpeter.info--

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
you should check it out--I'm going to be helping you with homework answers

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and answering questions in the forums,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so I'll see you in class.
