1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's do match first.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Match interfaces with the matchset, finds the set of remainders.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If there is a set of remainders, then it finds the shortest one.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The shortest remainder should be the longest text, and then we want to return that.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We want to return the text, and it's a match not a search,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so the match has to be at the beginning of the text, and it would go up to match.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So we match from the beginning of the text. How far do we want to go?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Well, everything except the remainder. How much is that?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, we can just subtract from the length of the text the length of the shortest,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and that gives us the initial piece of the longest possible match.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Here search calls into match.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What we do is we start iterating. We start at position number zero.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If there is a match there for the text starting at position zero, then we want to return it.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If not, we increment i to 1, and we say does the text from position 1 on--

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
is there a match there and so on. We just keep on going through until we find one.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Here what we want to say is "if the match is not None, then return m."

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Notice that it would be a bad idea to say "if m return m."

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Normally it's idiomatic in Python to say that if we're looking for a true value.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But the problem here is that the empty string we want to count as a true value.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A pattern might match the empty string. That counts as a match, not as a failure.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We can't just say "if m" because the empty string counts as false.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We have to say "if m is not None."
