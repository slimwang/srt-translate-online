1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,300
Algorithmically it's pretty
straightforward to do this.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,120
All right.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,320
We start off at any point in time we
have a set of particles at the last time

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:16,149
step and each particle has a state,
like its position and a weight.

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,590
And we're also going to be given a new
action, like let's take a step to

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,890
the meet, to the right two meters, and
we're going to take a new measurement.

7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,490
And then here's how
the particle filter runs.

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,530
We start off with a new
set of particles,

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:34,400
empty and a normalization constant of 0,
makes sense.

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,370
And then we just do
the following n times,

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,190
where n is the number of
particles that we need, all right?

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:45,910
So, the first thing we do is we sample a
particle from the previous distribution

13
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,415
that's from this distribution here,
according to its weight.

14
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:52,790
Okay, so
we just sample a particle, okay.

15
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:58,110
The next thing we do,
this is actually a combined step, okay.

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,200
It says control, but it really
should say control and control and

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,950
diffusion, right?

18
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,660
We sample a new state using two things.

19
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,130
Whatever the old one was,

20
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,940
so that's the value we pulled
from the particle, right?

21
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,040
That's this xt here.

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,820
We've sampled the particle.

23
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,450
It has a particular state
that goes right in there.

24
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,280
We also have the action.

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,240
And then, we have to sample
from the new distribution.

26
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,340
So, let's suppose the action is taking
a step immediately to the right.

27
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,860
Every time we do this,
make it go all right?

28
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,310
Take a step meter to the right and then,
I'm going to sample from a distribution

29
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,470
because there's actually some
uncertainty about that step, right?

30
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,450
That's our process noise, so
it's a little tight Gaussian.

31
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,540
I generated a,
a little bit of noise and I add that.

32
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,820
That's what this sampling value is here.

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,590
Using the previous sample, the control,
and then whatever the noise is, okay?

34
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,380
Then what I do is I
re-weight that sample.

35
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,840
What do I weight it by?

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,830
I weight it by how likely would
the measurement have been,

37
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,780
this is my likelihood, okay?

38
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,900
How likely would that
measure have been if that

39
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,710
new sample is actually where the the
object was or where the robot was?

40
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,000
That becomes my new weight.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,180
All right.

42
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,260
That's the multiplication
step we did before.

43
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,900
We took our prior, we had those lumps,
we multiplied and we got them through.

44
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,610
We just keep track of
the sum of those weights,

45
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:31,250
we add that particle to our growing set
of particles, and we do this n times.

46
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,430
Now we're all done, except one problem,
our weights don't sum to what?

47
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,860
They don't sum to 1 because
they were whatever they were.

48
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,610
We just did this multiplication.

49
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,280
So all we have to do is because we've
been keeping track of the sum of the sum

50
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,900
of the weights, that's theta.

51
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,260
We divide all the weights by that value.

52
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,050
And that's normalizing the weights.

53
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,900
When we're done, we have a new
distribution, bunch of particles.

54
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,100
Each particle is at a particular state.

55
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,970
Each particle has a weight.

56
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,400
And the sum of those weights is 1.

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,235
And so that's a valid,

58
00:03:00,235 --> 00:03:04,830
sampling-based representation
of the probabilistic density.

59
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,520
And that's it.

60
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,050
That's all of particle filtering.
