1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,490
Investors see thousands
of deals every year and

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:08,420
they are in a place where they can
really select the ones that they feel

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,281
close affinity with, believe in and
want to go with going forward.

4
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:15,582
So, for
them it's really about a matter of fit.

5
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:19,870
At a very high level,
I think they look at three categories.

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,035
The first category, the team.

7
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:24,480
They look at the team and they want
to be in a place where they invest in

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,870
people that they say, hey I want
to work with this entrepreneur for

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,730
the next five to seven years and beyond.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,750
So do they have good
chemistry with the person?

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,359
Do they think they're the right
team to push the startup forward?

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,360
The second category they
look at is the market.

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,680
Is the market opportunity big?

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,440
Is this something really
worth going after?

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,620
Is there a big problem to be solved
here and do I think there's a good match

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,890
between the team and the market
opportunity they're going after?

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,300
And the third item is the product or the
technology of what the team has done so

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:04,000
far to actually showcase that there's
a chance they'll exceed on their vision.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,590
So those three things and
in each place the team, the market,

20
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,020
the product, investors look at a slew
of things and sometimes they decide

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,800
not to invest because they think
the market is not big enough or

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,070
the team is great but
maybe don't have the expertise.

23
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,800
Maybe the product is too early.

24
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,930
And they want to see more proof points,
but

25
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,050
those are the three big buckets of
items I think most investors look at.
