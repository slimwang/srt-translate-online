1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,840
Separating the data and control plane can allow

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,880
for independent evolution of the data and control plane.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,080
Separating vendor hardware from the logic that controls

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,770
the behavior of the network, and the potential to

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,080
more easily reason about network behavior since the

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,790
behavior is now controlled from a single logically-centralized control

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,380
program. While it's possible that separating the control

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,070
plane from the data plane Could result in architectures

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,710
that are more fault tolerant or more scalable.

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,960
The separation of data and control plain does not

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,980
inherently make the network more fault tolerant or more

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,690
scalable. Therefore, neither of the first two options apply.
