00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,810
Welcome to this unit on networking. It covers how

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,090
computers communicate, from the very simple connections in a machine

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,810
cluster, to the architecture of the internet, which makes it

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,610
possible to reach most any willing computer around the world.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,840
We will assume a basic familiarity with technologies and terms,

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,590
such as anyone working with or programming computers would acquire

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,780
today. And we'll focus on how all these pieces fit

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,440
together. To make network communication possible and so simple for

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,200
its end users.
