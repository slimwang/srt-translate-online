00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,392
Now that the rational zero test has given us eight possibilities for zeroes at

2
00:00:03,392 --> 00:00:07,666
this function. Why don't we test some of them out? Now, of course, figuring out

3
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:10,203
the value of the function at any of these values for x will give us useful

4
00:00:10,203 --> 00:00:15,000
information. But right now, I'm really only interested in which ones of these,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,150
when plugged into our function, give us f of x 0. Or rather, f of whatever

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,404
value we plug in equals 0. Here's how we're going to go about doing this. I've

7
00:00:24,404 --> 00:00:27,515
made a list of the values of the function at all the possible zeroes we had,

8
00:00:27,515 --> 00:00:32,262
and I'd like you to evaluate all of these function values. All you need to do

9
00:00:32,262 --> 00:00:35,800
for this quiz is, starting at the top of the list, work your way down, and as

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,222
soon as you find a value of the function that equals 0, write a 0 in the box

11
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:45,658
next to that value. You can leave all the other boxes blank, and remember, you

12
00:00:45,658 --> 00:00:50,179
can stop after you have found just one zero. The top most one.
