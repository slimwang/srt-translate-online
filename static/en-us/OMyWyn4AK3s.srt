1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,050
In this lesson,

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,080
we'll cover the minimum changes required
to get your app running on Android tv.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,792
We'll also discuss how to prep
your development environment.

4
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:10,903
Users will launch your app from
the Android tv home screen.

5
00:00:10,903 --> 00:00:13,069
Your app will appear in the apps row,
and

6
00:00:13,069 --> 00:00:16,406
will be represented by a 320
by 180 pixel banner image.

7
00:00:16,406 --> 00:00:18,126
When the user chooses our banner,

8
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:21,283
Android tv will launch an activity
we specify in the manifest.

9
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:21,797
But first,

10
00:00:21,797 --> 00:00:25,390
I want to show you there's an even
better way to attract users to your app.

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,170
That's recommendations.

12
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,770
This is the recommendations row, and
your app can suggest content to appear

13
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,810
right here, front and
center on the Android T.V. home screen.

14
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,434
For example,

15
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,765
let's say the user just watched the
first couple of episodes in the series.

16
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:41,015
Your app could recommend the next
episode to appear right here.

17
00:00:41,015 --> 00:00:43,352
And of course,
since Android TV is built by Google,

18
00:00:43,352 --> 00:00:46,286
users can find your content by
searching for it with their voice.

19
00:00:46,286 --> 00:00:47,912
More on Reqs and Search later.

20
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:50,396
Let's take a look at our
application manifest.

21
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:53,949
The most important thing to note is
the leanback launcher intent filter.

22
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:57,535
This identifies our app as being
enabled for TV, and it's required for

23
00:00:57,535 --> 00:00:59,940
our app to be considered
a TV app in Google Play.

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,393
It's also used to specify the activity
that will be launched when a user

25
00:01:03,393 --> 00:01:05,884
chooses her app on the Android T.V.
home screen.

26
00:01:05,884 --> 00:01:09,420
Above that, you can see an activity that
will be launched when the user runs our

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,505
app on a mobile device.

28
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:14,199
If you plan to use the lean back support
library, as we will in this class,

29
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,240
the new must include Theme.Leanback.

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,572
This is required by most of
the fragments provided by

31
00:01:18,572 --> 00:01:19,584
the support library.

32
00:01:19,584 --> 00:01:22,276
If you'd like to create your own theme,
no problem, but

33
00:01:22,276 --> 00:01:25,714
be sure to inherit from Theme.Leanback
and override specific styles.

34
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:29,043
Now, if you're modifying
an existing app to also run on TV,

35
00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:33,307
it's important not to reuse the same
activity layout as for mobile devices.

36
00:01:33,307 --> 00:01:36,689
Building a slick user interface like the
one we saw earlier can be challenging,

37
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,113
but I've got great news for you.

38
00:01:38,113 --> 00:01:40,301
The leanback support library
includes fragments and

39
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,640
widgets that will make this hella easy.

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,900
Leanback provides fragments and
widgets for building T.V.

41
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,060
apps, including a catalog browser,
a details view, and playback controls.

42
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,211
Also included are nice card views for
displaying text and pictures.

43
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:54,129
Recyclerview helps us scroll through and

44
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:56,437
display large lists of
media items efficiently.

45
00:01:56,437 --> 00:01:58,235
This is important to do on a T.V.

46
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:00,942
device where media is rich and
memories limited.

47
00:02:00,942 --> 00:02:04,704
In order to be listed as compatible
with TV devices and Google Play,

48
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:09,138
your app must declare that you use
the feature android.software.leanback.

49
00:02:09,138 --> 00:02:13,132
If your APK will also run in other
devices like phones, tablets or wear.

50
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:16,035
Then you must declare
that required is false.

51
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:20,142
Also note that leanback here refers to
the Android TV home screen launcher app,

52
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:21,631
not the support libraries.

53
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:25,090
So you use this regardless of whether
you use the support libraries or not.

54
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,389
Now, if you're using Android Studio,
all of the dependencies for the Leanback

55
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:31,221
libraries will automatically be
added to your build.gradle file.

56
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:34,170
On the other hand, if you're using
Eclipse, see the instructor notes.

57
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,253
Also, a quick note for

58
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:38,279
completeness, Leanback depends
on the v4 support library.

59
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:41,789
Users will interact with your app
using a TV remote control, or

60
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:42,923
a game controller.

61
00:02:42,923 --> 00:02:46,592
Because of this, make sure your app
supports a d-pad control scheme.

62
00:02:46,592 --> 00:02:49,469
Android automatically applies
directional navigation between your

63
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,888
layout elements automatically.

64
00:02:50,888 --> 00:02:54,290
So you usually don't need to do anything
extra to have your app work with

65
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,207
a remote control.

66
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:57,510
Just in case navigation
doesn't work out of the box or

67
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,108
it doesn't work the way you prefer.

68
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:02,521
You can create a custom control scheme
by checking out the instructor note.

69
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:04,704
Let's talk for
a moment about T.V. hardware.

70
00:03:04,704 --> 00:03:07,225
Now obviously T.V.'s have a lot
of hardware differences with

71
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:07,930
a mobile device.

72
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,810
I don't know about yours but my T.V.

73
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,830
doesn't have an accelerometer for
example.

74
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,190
Will cover these in detail later.

75
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,460
But for now there's one feature you
always have to specify is not required

76
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,460
in your manifest.

77
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,830
And that's a touch screen.

78
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,300
More detail soon.

79
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,040
Last, let's talk for
a moment about Android versions.

80
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,230
Android T.V.
support first appeared in Android 5.0.

81
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,970
Before you begin building Android T.V.

82
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,020
apps update your SDK to version 21 or
higher.

83
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,220
Also update your S.T.K.
tools to version 24 or higher.

84
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,670
And be sure that your project targets
at least A.P.I. level twenty one.

85
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,590
More details on these are in the notes.

86
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,920
Okay, that's everything you
need to know to get started.

87
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,300
In the next lessons, we'll talk
about hardware differences and

88
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,770
the lean back support library.

89
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,150
Then it's on decode.

90
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,530
What's the name of the intent filter,
you need to specify for

91
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,950
your main activity on T.V. Refer to
the developer training if you get stuck
