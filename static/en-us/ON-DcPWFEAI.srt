00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,310
Structured analysis and design techniques are functionally oriented.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,990
They concentrate on the computations that need to be made.

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,940
The data upon which the functions operate are secondary to

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,120
the functions themselves. Object Oriented Analysis and

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,570
Design on the other hand is primarily concerned with the data objects.

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,000
These are defined first in terms of their attributes and data types.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,710
Later the functions are defined and associated with a specific objects.
