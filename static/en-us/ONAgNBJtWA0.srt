00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,251
RSA can be used for
encryption and signature.

2
00:00:03,251 --> 00:00:07,918
Its security is based on the assumption
that factoring a large number is

3
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:08,710
very hard.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,668
Diffie-Hellman is used for key exchange.

5
00:00:11,668 --> 00:00:16,239
Its security is based on the assumption
that the discrete log on large numbers

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,090
is very hard.
