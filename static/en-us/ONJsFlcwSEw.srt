And one more thing. On mobile, you can use a telecolon URL to create a

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,260
URL that when activated will actually dial

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,340
a telephone number. Of course, on desktop, these

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,900
URLs will typically fail, so you probably

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,410
want to deactivate them using a desktop media

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,750
query. This is a really handy feature, particularly

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,030
for business websites. Customes can instantly dial you.
