1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,650
So now our users can view dinners as
a starting step in the shopping process.

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,940
The next step is to let them
put dinners in the cart.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,320
We're going to add a button
to the Order Dinner screen

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,220
to let users put the dinner in the cart.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,240
So far, the order dinner activity
has used the generic show_info

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,550
layout but now it needs its own layout
file so we can add the buttons to it.

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,650
We'll still use the show info fragment

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,980
to show the information
about the dinner.

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,773
So you're going to add a new layout file
called order_dinner.xml to the layout

10
00:00:35,773 --> 00:00:37,260
folder.

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,560
This is a scroll view with
a linear layout, and it uses

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,400
the UseInfoBoxFragment to show the
information about the selected dinner.

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,590
And then it has some buttons.

14
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,820
The first button is Add to cart, and
there's some more buttons in here.

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,220
And they're commented out for now, and
you can add them in as you need them.

16
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,920
So you're going to be adding
the button to the Order Dinner screen.

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,770
And first you're going to
add order_dinner.xml.

18
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,519
And then you're going to need to update

19
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,270
order dinner activity
to use the new layout.

20
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,470
And you do that in the on create
method and specify the new layout.

21
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:19,237
So to send a hit to analytics when
a user puts a product in the cart,

22
00:01:19,237 --> 00:01:23,938
you need to create the product and
the product action as before.

23
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:28,419
And set the product
action to ACTION_ADD.

24
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:29,642
So you're going to need to

25
00:01:29,642 --> 00:01:32,970
define some methods in
the Order Dinner Activity class.

26
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,340
To add the dinner to the cart and
to send the Add to Cart hit.

27
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,399
Now for the add dinner to cart,
skeleton code only is enough.

28
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:51,093
Since this is a course about analytics,
not about implementing shopping carts,

29
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:55,390
we can gloss over the code to actually
add the dinner to the cart with a wave

30
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,180
of our hand.

31
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,695
But since this is a course
about analytics, I do expect

32
00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:04,825
you to implement the method that sends
the add to cart hit to analytics.

33
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:07,295
So a full implementation here please.

34
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:14,380
So a method that's used as the action
of a button must take a single argument

35
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,430
of a view.

36
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,200
So you'll need to define a method,

37
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,940
let's call it addDinnerToCart,
that takes a view.

38
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,500
And then it adds the dinner to the cart
and sends it here to analytics.

39
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,600
And for now, we don't need to implement
the code to actually add the dinner to

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,050
the cart, but it's nice to get
the feedback that something happened.

41
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,750
So I always like to Add a toast,
so go ahead and show a toast so

42
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,180
that when the user clicks a button
they see that something happened.

43
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,990
You're going to need to make some
other changes in the code for

44
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,080
the order dinner activity because you
won't be able to pass the dinner and

45
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,750
the dinner ID, from the method that's
activated by clicking the button.

46
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,026
And of course, you'll need to make sure
that the button action of the Add to

47
00:02:58,026 --> 00:03:02,960
Cart button calls the add
dinner to cart method.

48
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,810
So go ahead and do this coding and
then try out your app.
