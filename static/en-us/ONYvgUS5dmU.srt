00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,180
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,740
At this point, you know that
performance is important, and

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,710
you know what the parts
of the pipeline are.

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,870
So, now it's time to learn how to
use the tools at your disposal

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,780
to identify and destroy jank.

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,230
>> Yeah.
The main tool you're going to

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,580
use is Chrome's DevTools, and
in particular, the timeline.

8
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,850
>> In this lesson you'll dive
into DevTools' Timeline view

9
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,500
to start to identify exactly
where jank is happening.
