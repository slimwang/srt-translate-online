00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,632
Let's go through an example. In the last lessons you may have noticed our

2
00:00:03,632 --> 00:00:08,914
examples have been centered around social science. Like social networking, with

3
00:00:08,914 --> 00:00:13,385
the cloud example and your engagement in class. But in this lesson and the next

4
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:17,648
we'll be using a lot of examples from the fields of biology and medicine. Since

5
00:00:17,648 --> 00:00:21,912
statistics is heavily used in those fields as well. I drew a finch here, and

6
00:00:21,912 --> 00:00:26,388
that's because this next example deals with the beak width of finches.

7
00:00:26,388 --> 00:00:31,534
Specifically, scientist have looked at finches to make hypotheses about

8
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:36,831
evolution. By mapping a trait over time, like beak width. We can tell if the

9
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:42,271
environment is selecting for a particular size of beak width. Maybe there's a

10
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:47,390
particular beak size that better help this finch survive. But sometimes there

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,262
are random fluctuation in beak width due to variation in the population. Some

12
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:57,900
finches just have bigger beak widths than others. Therefore to determine

13
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,786
whether there is a significant change in beak width within the population over

14
00:01:00,786 --> 00:01:06,600
time. We need to use statistics. If the mean beak width does significantly

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,462
increase or decrease in size. This is referred to as Directional Selection.

16
00:01:11,462 --> 00:01:15,620
Then the environment allows the survival and reproduction of finches with

17
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,444
bigger beak widths. Let's say we know that the average beak width of all

18
00:01:20,444 --> 00:01:25,948
finches is 6.07 millimeters. This includes finches that have been studied over

19
00:01:25,948 --> 00:01:30,562
the last few years. But now let's say we're studying a sample of finches from

20
00:01:30,562 --> 00:01:35,722
today. We want to know, do finches today have beak widths that are different in

21
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:41,800
size? That means our null hypothesis is that, the population mean for finches

22
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,115
today is equal to what they have been. And what should the alternative

23
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:53,536
hypothesis be? That mu is less than 6.07, greater than 6.07, or not equal to

24
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:55,994
6.07.
