1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,105
So here's my question again and this is the model that we agreed upon. Lets pair

2
00:00:05,117 --> 00:00:10,091
some math with this model.I would have one stamp plus 2 piles of 3 or 2 times of

3
00:00:10,103 --> 00:00:15,243
3. Okay, here's what exiting about this math. I can actually calculate this math

4
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:19,875
two ways, I could do 1 plus 2 and get 3 times 3 which is 9 or I can do 2 times 3

5
00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:24,109
which is 6 and then add 1 which is 7. I know that the second answer must be

6
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:27,747
correct. I have 7 stamps in my diagram so I know that I need to do

7
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:32,343
multiplication first. This 2 has a choice. It can either go with multiplication

8
00:00:32,354 --> 00:00:36,813
or it could go with addition. I know multiplication takes priority. That's so

9
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:41,459
that way I can get the correct answer of 7. Just like in my model. Okay, so when

10
00:00:41,471 --> 00:00:45,627
I think about the order of operations, I know multiplication occurs before

11
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:49,734
addition. Multiplication has to happen before addition. It's at a higher

12
00:00:49,746 --> 00:00:53,572
priority level. It turns out that multiplication is also done before

13
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:57,557
subtraction. We know this because subtraction is the same as adding the

14
00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:01,911
opposite. For example, 3 minus 1 times 2. Subtracting a positive 1 is the same

15
00:01:01,923 --> 00:01:06,130
thing as adding a negative 1 or adding the opposite. So I can have 3 plus

16
00:01:06,142 --> 00:01:10,622
negative 1 times 2. Here the negative 1 can go with either the multiplication or

17
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:15,238
the addition. I know that multiplication comes first, it has higher priority. So

18
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,495
I should do 3 plus negative 2 and I get 1. So when thinking about the order of

19
00:01:19,507 --> 00:01:24,024
operations, we know addition and subtraction should be on the bottom, they come

20
00:01:24,036 --> 00:01:28,166
last. Multiplication should come before addition and subtraction I'm going to

21
00:01:28,406 --> 00:01:31,503
keep track of our order of operations right here, and we'll come back to this

22
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:34,236
later. Alright, let's check your understanding of this with a quiz.
