First of all, where does 5 fall on our distribution? Here, in between 3.4 and

2
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:11,232
8.2. How many standard deviations below the mean is that? Looks like about 1.5

3
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:16,832
or somewhere in between 1 and 2. So that's important. To keep in mind when we

4
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:22,372
use the z table. So what we need to do first is figure out exactly how many

5
00:00:22,372 --> 00:00:28,127
standard deviations 5 is from 13. How far is 5 from 13? It's 8 away. And how

6
00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:34,166
many standard deviations of 4.8 fit into 8? This is negative 1.67 if we round to

7
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:40,098
the nearest hundredths place. And remember, it's negative because 5 is less than

8
00:00:40,098 --> 00:00:45,045
the mean. So now we can bring up our z table. So here's the z table. And I

9
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:50,479
shared it with you in the link at the bottom. So we have negative 1.6 here. And

10
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:56,901
for negative 1.67, we find where this row and this column, intersect. And that's

11
00:00:56,901 --> 00:01:03,585
here at 0.0475. So if we look at our distrubution, then the proprotion less than

12
00:01:03,585 --> 00:01:10,096
5 is 0.0475. That means that a little less than 5% of students have gotten less

13
00:01:10,096 --> 00:01:12,945
than 5 points per post on average.
