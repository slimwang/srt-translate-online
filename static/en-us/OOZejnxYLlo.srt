1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This is again the simulation of heat conduction along a wire.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now, thermal diffusivity and Δx² are spared out and only the result

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
after 10 seconds is being shown--no intermediate results.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The result after 10 seconds is going to be complex enough

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
because we're going to modify the step size.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Find the step size that barely works. We don't want to see temperatures below the ambient temperature

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and in particular, we don't want to see negative temperatures.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Leave three decimal places of that step size.
