1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,270
All data store queries are performed using indexes,

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,520
and knowing how they work is important when you

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,340
design and build your applications. If you have

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,550
worked with a relational database management system, and SQL.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,870
You should be aware that those indexes are

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,330
not the same as data store indexes. Indexes in

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,740
RDBMS are a query optimization used to retrieve your

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,740
result faster. While indexes in Datastore are, in fact,

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:30,580
required to perform a query on that data at all. So you if you want to query for

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,080
Datastore data, there has to be an index for

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,740
that data. Be sure to remember this. So let's

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,870
look at Datastore indexes by going back to conferences.

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,680
And look at what happens when we perform a

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,440
search on the property city. In fact, let's even

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,950
talk about what happens before the query. When storing entities,

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,810
Datastore also updates index tables, which are

17
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,140
later used to find entities when the query

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,280
is made. These index tables consist of an

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,790
index value, that maps to a matching entity

20
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,450
key. Taking the city Berlin as an example,

21
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,033
the index value would be constructed using the

22
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:10,801
kind, conference. Then the property, city, and finally

23
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:15,030
the value of the property, Berlin. Here are

24
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,680
the index values for the cities Halloween,

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,590
London, and Paris. So again, the index value

26
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,600
is a combination of the kind, property, and

27
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,030
value of the property. Each index value then

28
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,010
points to the entity key where the value

29
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:34,150
resides. So a matching entity where city is

30
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,570
Berlin has the following key. And one with

31
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,920
London has the following key, and so on.

32
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,880
So let's say your favorite city is, Paris.

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,040
And you would like to get all conferences that

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,030
are in Paris. Then Datastore would look at the

35
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,160
index table where city is Paris, and find all

36
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,140
matching entities. Since data store require index tables

37
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,350
to perform queries, every property that you query for

38
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,624
will need an index table. By default, Datastore creates

39
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,310
these automatically. But we will also see how you

40
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,510
can control this later on.
