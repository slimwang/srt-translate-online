1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I would say the answer is this one, and the reason for that is it has two clearly larger groups

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and two smaller group that are about the same size.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
All the groups over here are pretty different sizes and the same here,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the all groups here are the exact same size.
