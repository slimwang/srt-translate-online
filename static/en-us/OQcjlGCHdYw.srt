1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,160
Joe Kraus came to speak at Wycominator.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,980
He was the previous founder of Xsite,
an old search engine company.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,280
And then eventually he did his own
new start called JotSpot at the time,

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,530
which was this freemium
software-as-a-service wiki company.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,910
And they had set up pricing and
in his talk at YC, it just made sense.

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,640
It was like, oh, we thought about
pricing where the top end tier of

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,150
the pricing would be stuff that
people didn't need to get.

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,968
Permission from legal or financial or
get a special document or

9
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:32,326
review done, that people can just
pay it on the corporate credit card.

10
00:00:32,326 --> 00:00:33,440
$200 a month, he said.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,490
It seems to be what the limits are for
that.

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,390
And then we step down the features
based on the usage, downwards.

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,220
And then we always knew we
wanted to have a freemium plan.

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,110
Or a free plan that people can try
out the service because we felt like

15
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,070
our user experience was going
to be what sells a lot of

16
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,122
what sells a lot of what Wufoo does.

17
00:00:51,122 --> 00:00:53,810
Although I think completely
different about that now when

18
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,920
I advise companies about going freemium.

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,984
But that's how it started,
it's just starting with his price and

20
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:01,293
that made sense and
then we figured out the tiers.

21
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:03,784
Where it was going to be the cutoff for
the functionality,

22
00:01:03,784 --> 00:01:05,696
just based on looking
at our competitors.

23
00:01:05,696 --> 00:01:07,430
Here's what they do,
can we be more generous?

24
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,420
Do we have a guess on what's going to
me us different or what have you?

25
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,110
And I think one of the best things that
we did is we offered plans that offered

26
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,310
unlimited forms.

27
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,500
Because it was this idea, you get
them hooked into this idea that you

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,840
can use forms for
anything and everything.

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,610
And yes,

30
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,670
everyone's going to come in on one
vertical or one very specific use case.

31
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,740
But if you have the idea,

32
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,050
it's like oh, there's an unlimited
resource of these things.

33
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,660
Which it kind of truly is, because the
marginal cost of building another form,

34
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,100
allowing people to make another one,
costs us nothing.

35
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,840
And so it's easy to be generous on that.

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,140
But what we want to do is hook them in,
where now everyone in the organization

37
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,530
using Wufoo for
all different kinds of uses cases.

38
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,248
And then they start thinking about
problem solving in the Wufoo ways,

39
00:01:48,248 --> 00:01:52,105
like I can use Wufoo for this, I can
do this for this, or do this for this.

40
00:01:52,105 --> 00:01:55,832
And then that's what makes a
subscription business do really well is

41
00:01:55,832 --> 00:02:00,021
that when people start relying you on in
a long term relationship sort of way.

42
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:02,473
It's like this is a long
term solution for

43
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:05,076
lots of different
problems in the company.

44
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:08,078
I think what's tricky is Wufoo's one
of those generalized products where it

45
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:09,900
could be used for
lots of different stuff.

46
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,630
We had every industry,
market or vertical using Wufoo.

47
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,150
And that is because forms is the first
step of interaction of collecting data,

48
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,970
interacting with people.

49
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,850
Creativity was always
our biggest problem.

50
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,670
People not knowing
what do I do with this.

51
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,680
It sounds neat but how do I utilize it?

52
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,290
So we spent a lot of time
on education to get people

53
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,980
get hooked on in their first use case,
so

54
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,110
that way they'll eventually
learn the other ways to use it.
