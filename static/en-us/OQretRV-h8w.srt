00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Another particle filter question.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Check the following statements if they're true.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
They are usually easy to implement.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
They scale quadratically with the dimensionality of the state space.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They can only be applied to discrete state spaces.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Finally, if none of those applies, check the final check mark over here.
