00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,778
To find the number of seconds this is going to take, we need to divide 1.5

2
00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:09,225
times 10 to the 11th by 3 times 10 to the 8th. Let's use our calculator to do

3
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:14,007
this. We have 1.5 times 10 to the 11th. You want to divide that by 3 times 10

4
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:21,190
to the 8th. And look at that. We get 500. 500 seconds is just over 8 minutes.

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,820
So when we look at the sun, we're seeing 8 minutes into the past. That's some

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,689
crazy stuff.
