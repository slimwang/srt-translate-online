00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,822
On this interval of the domain, f of x is actually decreasing. So as you move

2
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:09,442
from one x value to the right, increase in the value of x, the curve here is

3
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:14,228
dropping. The y values or rather the f of x values are decreasing as x values

4
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:19,125
are increasing. So whenever a function is going down or has a negative slope we

5
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:22,713
say that it is decreasing on that interval of the domain.
