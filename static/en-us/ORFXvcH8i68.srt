If you got x squared, 4x, 2x and 8, excellent work. I know I have a square of x

2
00:00:05,596 --> 00:00:10,911
on each side, so the area must be x squared. For this rectangle, one side is x

3
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:16,248
and the other side is 4. So I get an area of 4 times x. This rectangle has an

4
00:00:16,248 --> 00:00:21,641
area of 2x, since this side is 2 and this side is x. Our last rectangle has an

5
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:27,633
area of 8. This short side is 2. And this horizontal piece is 4. 2 times 4 makes

6
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:27,837
8.
