00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,080
You've learned a lot about visual encodings and visual perception.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,360
Now hear from Johnathan as he breaks down a very complex graphic

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,880
from The New York Times.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,910
>> Thanks Chris.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,600
The visualization that I'm going to be focusing on comes from

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,600
The New York Times, and was created by Jeremy Eskinouse, Matthew Block,

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,020
Shan Carter, and Amanda Cox.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,190
This entire visualization was built in D3 and

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,220
can be found in at the URL in my browser at the top here, and

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,680
all you need to play with the graphic is simply any modern web browser.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,630
I really suggest that you go to the page to play with the interactive graphic.

12
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,430
I'm just going to talk through a few visual encodings and

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,410
elements of why I think this is a very effective visualization, but

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,270
you do not really get the full effect until you experience it yourself.

15
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,690
As you can see here, if you hover over each circle,

16
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,420
you should get more information about each company.

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,630
And at the top here, are next bud ins to progress through the animation and

18
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,040
the narrative of this visualization.

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,379
One of the quickest, easiest, and clearest ways to communicate with your

20
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,460
reader and audience is through the effective use of a title.

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,900
As you can see here, the visualization is very obviously trying to

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,260
communicate how Facebook's IPO compares to the IPOs of

23
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,690
every other tech company in recent if not all of history.

24
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:27,080
Of the visual encodings we talked about earlier, this visualization uses size,

25
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,780
shape, x and y position, and color to encode its information.

26
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,040
Though this visualization uses five visual encodings to convey its

27
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,340
information and data, not all these encodings I would say are equal.

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,100
Two of these encode the same information and

29
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,680
was typically referred to in visualizations as double encoding.

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,700
In this case, the y axis, representing company value,

31
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,130
is encoded both in the y coordinate or

32
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,420
y position of its circle, but also in the size or radius of that circle.

33
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,800
The greater a company's value,

34
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,000
the larger its circle will be, and the higher it will be placed on the y-axis.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,360
This double encoding of the company value,

36
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,010
really emphasizes its importance in this visualization, especially since,

37
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,540
as Chris just covered, positional encodings are the most accurate encoding.

38
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,630
Also in this case, the x axis, or x position, encodes the year of the IPO,

39
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:32,050
but also color, at the far left, is encoded by the brightness of the red and

40
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,310
at the far right we have the bluest blues.

41
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,480
So, in this case, color and

42
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,080
x position both encode the year that the company IPOed.

43
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,520
In this visualization,

44
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,540
shape does not encode any concrete information since there are only circles.

45
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,680
Since you always have to choose a shape for a bubble chart like this, a circle

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,750
is a neutral shape, at least until you start using other shapes in conjunction.

47
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,870
But if there were circles, squares, maybe triangles,

48
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,140
each of those can encode a different type of company maybe by its industry but

49
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,260
in our case, again, since there's only circles,

50
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,180
shape does not encode much concrete or valuable information.

51
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,960
A fifth encoding that we haven't explicitly covered and

52
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,780
is sometimes not formally thought of as a visual encoding is opacity.

53
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,260
Opacity is very similar to color saturation or

54
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,460
density, as we covered previously, but it is not exactly the same.

55
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:30,030
The opacity in this case, refers to how transparent each of the circles are.

56
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,490
And while the opacity doesn't communicate any information about the data points,

57
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,290
in our case it does allow us to se the relative distribution of

58
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,660
the data points and how they overlap.

59
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,410
Since there is many companies that apparently IPOed in the year 2000,

60
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,310
they all had relatively small company values at the time.

61
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,930
We see a very dense dark purple, but if you notice as we go up,

62
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,300
we have a few circles where we can notice the overlap, and

63
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,210
some circle that are off on their own, with no overlap.
