1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,660
Okay Michael, so here is a, another little game for us

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,790
to play. And, what I want you to notice about this

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,310
game before I describe it to you in detail is that

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,030
we have relaxed yet another one of the constraints. So, we

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,660
started out playing two player, zero sum, deterministic games of perfect

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,920
information. There's also a finite in there somewhere. From now on

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,980
we're just going to assume everything's finite, because why not? And then,

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,250
what we did last time. Just a few seconds ago. Is we

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,770
relax the deterministic part, so we have two player,

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,280
zero sum, non-deterministic games of perfect information, and now

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,840
we are going to relax the requirement for perfect information.

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,540
So now we're going to look at two player, zero-sum,

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,920
possibly non-deterministic games of hidden information. And this is

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,520
really important Michael because, this last little bit of

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,740
relaxation, going from perfect information to hidden information is

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,340
going to be sort of a quantum leap into the

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,720
difficult problems of game theory. So this is where

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,060
it actually starts to get interesting so we have been

19
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,960
building a foundation so far and now we are

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,720
going to get to the interesting and complicated stuff, okay?

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,970
>> Wow, one of the things that I learned

22
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,030
just now is that the opposite of perfect is hidden.

23
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,500
>> Yes.

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,740
>> I always thought the opposite of perfect is imperfect but okay but hidden.

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,910
I guess if I do not have a perfect face I should hide my face.

26
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,900
>> Thats in fact the atomology

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,270
of the phrase.

28
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,958
>> Alright, I understand now.

29
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:21,240
>> Yeah, cool, It's in wikipedia. Here we go, let me describe

30
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,990
the game to you, are you ready? This is a version of

31
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,100
mini poker where there are a set of cards, but they have

32
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,250
no numbers of faces on them they are just red or black, okay.

33
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,570
>> And red is bad, for our hero, Player

34
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,590
A, and black is good for our hero, Player A.

35
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:40,740
>> Okay?

36
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,260
>> I see.

37
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:41,693
>> So--

38
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:42,660
>> Wait. Why's it have to be red?

39
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,860
>> I don't know, man. You know, red. You know how it is. Okay.

40
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,090
So, here are the rules. They're all written down on the screen, but let me

41
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,730
walk through them with you. So A is delta card. Magically. It will be red

42
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,880
or black. and, the probability of it being red or black is 50% each. Okay?

43
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,570
>> Yes.

44
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,300
>> Right. So we have a uniform prior over, over the

45
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,120
color. Now, remember red is bad for A and black is good

46
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:12,380
for A. So, it's going to turn out without loss of generality, that if A gets

47
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,200
a black card, A's definitely going to hold onto

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,030
the card. Okay? Now A gets this card.

49
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,930
B, player B, does not get to see the card. A can choose to either resign or to

50
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:27,190
hold. If A resigns given a red card, then he looses 20 cents. Okay?

51
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,430
>> Okay. Wait. So A's dealt red. A may resign if

52
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,290
but only if red.

53
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,260
>> Right.

54
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,890
>> And then A loses 20 cents.

55
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,770
>> Right.

56
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,400
>> Okay. Alright, okay.

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,530
>> Okay, so this is a betting game. It's not strange it makes perfect

58
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,760
sense its sort of a metaphor for life. Now A can choose to hold instead,

59
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,800
hold the card. Thus requiring B to do something. So if A holds the card B can

60
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,700
either resign or can demand to see the card. Now if B resigns

61
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,230
then A gets 10 cents. Regardless of the color of the card. Okay?

62
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,240
>> Yep.

63
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,360
>> That make sense?

64
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,910
>> Yep.

65
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,730
>> Okay. Now if B chooses to see the card, in fact demands to

66
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,000
see the card. Then if the card is red, then A loses 40 cents. But

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,770
if the card is black, then A gets 30 cents. And since we're betting, this

68
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,500
means that whatever A wins, B loses and vice versa. That makes it zero sum.

69
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,590
>> Got it.

70
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,640
>> Okay, is this all make sense?

71
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,420
>> Yeah, I

72
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,030
don't know if I can hold all those different numbers in

73
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,760
my head. But I, but the basic pattern of it is,

74
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,920
that as you say Red is, red is bad, black is

75
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,680
good. If A gets a bad card, A can essentially either fold

76
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,465
>> Mm-hm.

77
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:39,060
>> Right, resign? Or kind of bluff, like hey I've

78
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,070
got this great card and then A and if

79
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,470
B believes that the card is bad then and

80
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,660
calls A or, or, or, and, and just folds then,

81
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,680
then A gets, A wins that. But if B says no I think

82
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,260
maybe you're bluffing and calls him, then

83
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,470
everybody's rewards are more extreme, I guess.

84
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,850
>> >Exactly. So it's just a version of poker. A weird version of poker.

85
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,180
Simple version of poker. But a version of poker, none the less. There's a

86
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,940
minor little detail here which isn't that

87
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,930
important, but you know, notice it's written

88
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:13,270
that A will A may resign if its red. Basically, A will never resign

89
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,870
on a black card. Because it just doesn't

90
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,140
make any sense. And so there's really, it just,

91
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,240
there's not point in riding it out. Okay.

92
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,950
Because black is always good, sort of, nothing bad

93
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,160
can ever happen to A, if A gets a black card. So there's really sort of no

94
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,970
point in riding anything out. But that's just

95
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,750
a minor detail. Regardless these are the rules. Okay?

96
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,460
>> Okay.

97
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,570
>> You got it? Sure.

98
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,530
>> I'm going to re-draw this as a game tree which might make

99
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,120
it a little easier to keep all the rules in your head.
