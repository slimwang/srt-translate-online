00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,400
Here's an illustration of that process if we have an object of class Foo and

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,770
it has various attributes in it. And if we wanted

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:17,310
to associate with each class Foo, Foo, some number of instances of class Bar,

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,920
we could just have a vector in each instance. And each of the vector

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,010
elements would refer to one of the instances of the, the target class.
