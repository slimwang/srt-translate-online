1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,990
So now you know the process
of building an engaging game.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,930
And you have insight into how game
design can keep players returning

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,060
to your game.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,968
>> So what do you think with
key takeaways from this lesson.

5
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:13,420
<< I think the most important
thing I learned is,

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,050
that there's no one way to monetize a
game or get your players engaged in it.

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,590
But to make a great game, you always
want to keep your audience in mind and

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,970
choose the best game pace for them.

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:24,590
>> Yeah.

10
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,570
Building a game so
it gets more difficult over time and

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,560
involves friendly competition is a great
way to keep your game interesting.

12
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,960
>> And keeping players interested and
having high player retention

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,930
is the main way a game will
make money and not fizzle out.

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,300
>> Besides game pace we also
made sure that our game was

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,870
easy to use across devices by saving
all our data into the cloud and

16
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,640
building in an easy restart mechanism.

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,310
>> And finally we talked
about how to get a fan base

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,940
who can help you promote your game
through social networks and outreach.

19
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,190
>> A couple of times we've also
mentioned ways to make money in your

20
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,110
game through in app ads,
purchases and so on.

21
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,210
But we'll talk about this in
more detail in the next section

22
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,440
which is all about
monetization strategies.
