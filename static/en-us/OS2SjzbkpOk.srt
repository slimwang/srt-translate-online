Okay, in my story I had one single stamp so I noticed that in A, B, C, and D, I

2
00:00:04,925 --> 00:00:09,484
have a single stamp here. So the difference has to be with the piles. I made two

3
00:00:09,496 --> 00:00:13,774
piles of three stamps so I know I need to find 2 piles in my diagram. Answer

4
00:00:13,786 --> 00:00:17,810
choice B has three piles, cause I see the three red circles of two. So this one

5
00:00:17,822 --> 00:00:21,530
can't be right. And answer choice C, I have one pile of six. So that's not

6
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:25,470
right, either. When I look at answer choice A, I have three stamps in one pile,

7
00:00:25,562 --> 00:00:29,380
and three stamps in another. I know that answer A has to be correct. D is not

8
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:32,970
correct. I have four stamps in one pile, and two stamps in another pile.
