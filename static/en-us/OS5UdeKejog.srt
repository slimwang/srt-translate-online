00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,010
The contacts app is actually a perfect
example of when you would want to

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,098
use a content provider.

3
00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:07,360
You can the provider and
then under the hood, it'll either

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,490
access the database or it might talk
to the file system to get photos.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,090
And having it all wrapped up
inside the content provider

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,210
also makes it really easy to share this
data with other apps on the device.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,350
Say, for example,
you have a social networking app.

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,050
It might want to have access
to your list of contacts, or

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,180
it might want to add information
to existing contacts.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,430
And the way that these apps communicate
with each other is through an agreement,

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,540
which is the contacts contract.

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,610
There's one more benefit
that I wanted to mention.

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,510
The framework actually
takes care of security for

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,160
you with the content provider.

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,180
So the data is safe and
it won't be provided to other apps

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,760
unless those apps have the proper
permissions to access it.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,300

about the contacts provider,
