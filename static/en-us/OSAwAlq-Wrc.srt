00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,405
Here's a list of some algorithms,

2
00:00:02,405 --> 00:00:07,344
and you need to identify which of these is a bulk parallel algorithm.

3
00:00:07,344 --> 00:00:13,883
So finding the largest value in a set as if I have a collection of numbers, and I want to find which one is biggest.

4
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:17,387
Summing elements of an array as if I have an array of values,

5
00:00:17,387 --> 00:00:21,012
adding them all together to get a final total sum.

6
00:00:21,012 --> 00:00:26,971
Adding 2 strings together as if I have a string, for example, hello everybody.

7
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:34,037
Another string, how are you today? Combining them to make a single string of hello everybody, how are you today?

8
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:41,245
So identify in these boxes which of these algorithms would be a bulk parallel algorithm.
