In the previous lesson, we examined some techniques for

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:07,540
learning about concepts from examples. But those were simple concepts that we

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,470
learned from a few examples. Concepts like arg or foo,

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:16,250
which was our imaginary, hypothetical concept. The real world

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,780
concepts can be much more complicated than that. Consid, as an example,

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,120
consider the eight animals shown here. Each picture shows a very cute

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,340
animal here. How many of these do you think are birds? Which ones are birds?
