00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We've congratulated ourselves for getting this far. We've still got a ways to go.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now the question is what do we do next?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It may seem a little bit daunting, but there's so much to do, and when I get that feeling,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I remembered the book Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott, a very funny book.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In it, she relates the story of how when she was in elementary school and there was

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
a big book report due where she had to write up descriptions of multiple different birds.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And she was behind and it was due soon, and she went to her father and complained,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
"How am I ever gonna get done. I'm behind," and her father just told her, "Bird by bird."

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
"Just go and take the first bird, write up a report on that, and then

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
take the next bird off the list and keep continuing until you're done."

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's go bird-by-bird and finish this up. What do we have left to do?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, we got to figure out how to put letters on one particular row while dealing with the crosswords,

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
then we got to expand from that to all the rows and then we got to do the columns as well,

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and then we got to worry about the scoring.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There was a couple of minor things to be put off like dealing with the blanks.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's a lot to do, and let's go bird-by-bird .
