00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,040
So here we are in the manual and

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,390
I guess it didn't take that
much searching after all.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,029
The option is -a for all.

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,196
So if we type ls -a,
we'll see our dot files too.

5
00:00:11,196 --> 00:00:14,520
Oh, and there's .secret.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,360
So the answer to the quiz
question was ls -a,

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,424
but also be correct
if you said ls --all.
