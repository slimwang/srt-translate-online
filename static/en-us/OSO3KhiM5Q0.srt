1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,020
So let's quickly review which properties I indexed.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,520
The name property's indexed. We're very likely going to

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,830
want to search for conferences by name. The description

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,180
property is not indexed. We're not going to query

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,055
for the conferences by description. And it's actually fairly

6
00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:19,590
typical, that if a property is going to have possibly

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,420
a long text string as its value, that you're

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,310
not going to index it. And city is indexed.

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,510
We're going to want to query the conferences by city.

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,600
For example, which conference is taking in place in Tokyo?

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,720
Which ones in San Francisco? In our case, the start

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,320
date is not going to be indexed. It's not that unlikely

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,040
that you might want to query conferences by start date.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,990
It's just that in our case, we're not going to do

15
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,210
that. Now you could have figured out which properties are

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,380
indexed, by looking in the source code for conference. For example,

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,030
we see that name is indexed. Description doesn't have

18
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,920
the @index annotation. So it's not indexed. And so

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,010
on, for the rest of the fields. But an

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,769
easier way to check once you've actually created some conferences,

21
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,630
is just to look in the Data Store Viewer.

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,190
And the Data Store Viewer shows you which properties are

23
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,990
not indexed, by this little unindexed annotation. You've probably

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,670
already seen this. And that just means that the property's

25
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,740
not going to be indexed. You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes

26
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,350
to figure out that the converse is true. If you don't see

27
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,280
that @index mark here, then the property is going to be indexed. So

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,960
here we can tell that max attendees is going to be indexed. Now

29
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,550
that we've got some conferences, we can go ahead and learn how

30
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,460
to query on them. And Magnusson's going to talk to you about the

31
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,630
different types of queries. And then I'll talk you through how to

32
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,610
write the code to write the queries. See you in a minute.
