00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,426
It sounds logical that happy people don't go to war, but we don't know that

2
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:09,050
McDonald's makes people happy, for one thing, and even if it does, many other

3
00:00:09,062 --> 00:00:13,426
factors could make people unhappy again. For this one, I'm thinking that

4
00:00:13,438 --> 00:00:18,142
countries that have McDonald's tend to be more economically developed. And

5
00:00:18,154 --> 00:00:22,386
therefore have more money, so it's implausible they wouldn't be able to afford

6
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:26,637
to go to war. That's my own hunch, but I'm pretty sure this is implausible. For

7
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:30,872
this one, we don't know anything about how many people eat at McDonalds and how

8
00:00:30,884 --> 00:00:35,166
often, and we don't even know for sure if eating McDonalds would make people too

9
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:39,942
unhealthy to engage in a war. This one seems to be the most plausible option.

10
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:44,644
Countries with McDonald's are more open to globalization, and less inclined to

11
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:49,151
go to war. But I have to admit, that would be pretty awesome if we could obtain

12
00:00:49,163 --> 00:00:53,800
world peace just by building a McDonald's in every country. If that were true, I

13
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:55,845
would definitely advocate for that.
