For your next feet of coding magic, I'd like you to write a method that returns

2
00:00:03,726 --> 00:00:08,658
the location of the first occurrence of Mad Hatter in the text. I'd also like

3
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:11,634
you to add a line to the tester program, so that it prints the location of the

4
00:00:11,634 --> 00:00:15,690
first occurrence in Mad hatter. For this one it's okay if you just print the

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,807
actual and not the expected. What is the actual value? What is the location it

6
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:20,470
prints?
