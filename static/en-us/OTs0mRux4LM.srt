1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,780
So the [UNKNOWN] agent figured out that handle is fixed should go

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,840
beneath object enables drinking, but not beneath object is liftable.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,440
So the agent will put handle is fixed here, in this particular explanation.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,760
This is correct. If the agent has background knowledge,

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,430
it tells it that the reason handle is fixed is important is,

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:25,270
because it makes the object manipulable, which in turn enables drinking.

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,090
Then the agent can insert this additional assertion here in the explanation.

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,720
Even more, if the agent has additional background knowledge that tells it,

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,650
the defect of the object has a handle, and that the handle is fixed, together

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,700
make the object orientable, which is what makes the object manipulatable, then

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,790
the agent may come up with a richer explanation. The important point here is,

12
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,215
that as powerful and important as classification is, it alone is not sufficient.

13
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:56,000
There're many situations under which explanation too is very important.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,910
Explanation leads to richer learning, deeper learning.
