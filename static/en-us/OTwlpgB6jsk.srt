1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,330
I'd really like to give big hugs
to all the people who made this

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,430
course possible.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,800
That of course includes the whole
production team, especially Amanda,

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,710
Catherine, and Morgan,
as well as Charlie and Robert for

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,790
their work on the mini projects.

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,570
All these good people deserve credit for
the really good parts of the class, and

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,290
none of the blame for the less good
parts, which of course falls on moi.

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,940
And finally, I want to thank
serial computers everywhere for

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,730
their patience and understanding.

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,514
[SOUND] Especially when
I was staying up way

11
00:00:30,514 --> 00:00:35,280
past everyone's bedtime,
keeping the lights on.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,143
So with that, I'm out of here, toodles!

13
00:00:39,143 --> 00:00:41,821
Lights out!

14
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:42,680
Cut.

15
00:00:46,194 --> 00:00:49,887
[MUSIC]

16
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:53,950
Viva la HPC!

17
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,866
Viva la HPC!

18
00:00:55,866 --> 00:00:59,012
Viva la HPC!

19
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:00,510
Viva la HPC!

20
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,007
Viva la HPC!
