1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,950
In the MainActivity.java file, we modify
the MainActivity decrement method.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,640
First we create an integer
quantity variable and

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,300
initialize the value to two.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,680
Then we update the quantity variable to
have a value equal to the current value

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,020
of quantity minus one.

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,820
In this case, the current value
of quantity will be two, so

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
two minus one equals one.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,910
So when we display quantity,
it should have a value of one.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,730
When I click on the minus button,
then it updates to one on the screen.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,710
I can add a breakpoint and
run the app in debug mode.

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,960
If I click on the minus button,
the breakpoint is triggered.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,230
I can click step over, and then I
immediately see the quantity variable

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,390
is down here with a value of two.

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,770
If I click step over again,
then quantity has been decreased by one,

15
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,390
and now quantity equals one.

16
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,590
If I click resume,
then the screen updates to one.

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,540
Awesome.

18
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,080
Now we have all the small
pieces in place.

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,280
In the next video, we're going to finish
hooking up the quantity picker so

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,130
that it works when you
tap it more than once.
