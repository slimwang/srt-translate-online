1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,730
So I think my favorite app would be Sound Hound.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,390
And basically your out at a party or a store.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,310
And the song comes on and you're like "oh, this

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,900
song is awesome but I don't know what it is". And

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,080
you pull out the Sound Hound and it listens to

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,676
a little bit and it tells you it's Jay-Z and

7
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:21,030
BeyoncÃ©, Bonnie and Clyde. I can't think of anything about

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,100
it that really annoys me. If they could improve it there's

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,270
songs that it doesn't recognize. Like they're building the

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,760
library the whole time and I'm sure it, you know,

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,540
they can make it faster but if say as they're

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,640
building their library later on. And it recognizes one of

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,570
the songs they didn't recognize earlier if it would

14
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,300
just text me and it would be like that song

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,970
that you were listening to eight months ago? This is

16
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,910
what it was and then I, that would be amazing.

17
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,240
>> I think my favorite app is C25K and the C

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,010
stands for couch potato and it's basically where you.

19
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,920
>> If you have no running experience, it

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,530
gets you up to running 5k in eight weeks.

21
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,980
>> Some of my favorite features in this app is that it allows you to play

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,465
music while you're running and then whenever the

23
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:09,070
app talks to you, it pauses the music.

24
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,160
>> So I never have to worry about running over

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,570
the time that it allotted for me or anything like that.

26
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,550
>> It uses the playlists

27
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,870
that are already in my phone, so if I create playlists, like, I

28
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,950
love Justin Timberlake, so I have a

29
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,040
running Justin Timberlake playlist and if I'm

30
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,200
in the mood, then I put that o, or if I'm into like some

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,170
nineties music, I have my nineties running

32
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,310
playlist, so I love having that option.

33
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,860
>> So one of my favorite apps is Pinterest, it's a service that

34
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,092
allows you to collect digital images you like and put them into boards.

35
00:01:39,092 --> 00:01:42,270
>> So, there's various uses of it and

36
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,960
personally I've been trying to come up with a visual theme for our website.

37
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,850
>> And I use that board to collect different

38
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,590
images on robots cause that's a theme were pursuing.

39
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,210
>> And I just put them into a board and I can quickly see

40
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:02,760
like patterns and like, things I like in one place so that's very powerful.

41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,440
>> And I can use that for inspiration, mobile and desktop across

42
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,160
various different platforms.

43
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,200
>> So, an app that I didn't like that I downloaded a while back.

44
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,480
>> I think it was called SleepBot and basically, it

45
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,760
uses an an accelerometer to track your movements as you sleep.

46
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,450
>> And it figures out when, how deep of a sleep

47
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,720
cycle you're in and wakes you up when you're not in

48
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,920
such a deep sleep cycle. It wasn't very reliable the way

49
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,460
it works is that you say you want to wake up, let's say

50
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,470
at say 6:30 and it'll either wake you up up to 15

51
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,030
minutes before or up to 15 minutes after that didn't always happen.

52
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,090
>> It could have been an hour, two hours or it would just never ring.

53
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,555
>> It's not a good idea when you have a job.

54
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:49,460
>> [LAUGH]. So last app I remember uninstalling

55
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,610
I think was called Public Bike SF. It

56
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,380
gave you biking routes through the city. So,

57
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,530
San Francisco's a very hilly city and it tells

58
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,440
you like you're going here to here. Take these streets so

59
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,730
you don't have to you know, climb up this crazy hill and

60
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,470
go back down it but I'm not using my phone while I'm

61
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,720
on my bike. So, it was basically just useless and really slow.
