Here's what it might look like. That is, we use some kind of collection class,

2
00:00:04,246 --> 00:00:08,740
a hash table or a set or an array to hold all the pairs of associated objects.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,720
Each of the columns is going to correspond to an attribute in an instance and

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,980
we have one instance for each of the links in the original association.
