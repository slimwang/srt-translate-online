If you use the app and then you select two dice, you might notice that this

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:11,660
scale goes from two to twelve and that's because this app sums up the two rolls.

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,535
But this is still the same concept because when you take the average, you sum up

4
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:21,430
the two rolls and then you just divide by two. So, the distribution will look

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:26,536
exactly the same pretty much as what is shown here. Except the scale will just

6
00:00:26,536 --> 00:00:31,016
be these numbers divided by two. But the important thing is that the shape of

7
00:00:31,016 --> 00:00:37,310
the distribution will be the same. So let's roll 2 dice once. So we get that the

8
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:43,390
sum is 9, which means that the average would be 4.5. If we roll again we would

9
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:50,054
get that the average is 3 and the sum is 6. And we can keep doing this a number

10
00:00:50,054 --> 00:00:56,646
of times and you see that the more we roll the dice and plot the distribution of

11
00:00:56,646 --> 00:01:02,634
the sums or the averages, it looks more and more normal. Play around with this

12
00:01:02,634 --> 00:01:05,163
applet because it's a really good learning tool.
