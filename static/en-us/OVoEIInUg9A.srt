In the post, Noah says he would take a line chart, a histogram or

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,970
bar chart, and the table on his island.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,600
For me, I would take a scatter plot to represent relationships between

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,320
variables, a stacked bar plot to represent comparisons, and

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,400
finally a line plot to represent trends in time.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,900
I often think the most interesting insights come from comparisons and

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,520
juxtaposition of data and time, so my charts might be slightly biased.
