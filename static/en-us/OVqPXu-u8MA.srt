1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,360
For the solution we look for the list array.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,070
Each element in the list represents one days forecast. Given

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,860
the day index we find the temperature node and then

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,700
the max temperature. And this is what the code would

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,340
look like. We change the JSON string into a JSON

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,590
object. Then we look for the list array. Within that

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,730
we find the day we care about. Then we look

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,660
for the temp node. And then find the max temperature.
