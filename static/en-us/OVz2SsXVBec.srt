1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,540
Let's look at number 1.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,470
Before I reveal the answer,
I'm going to copy this code and

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,700
paste it into Android Studio.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,060
I want to show you what kind
of error would come out.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,090
Now when you were solving this quiz,
you didn't need to use Android Studio,

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,510
you could have solved it by just
looking at the code here and

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,280
then writing in the answer.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,520
So, whether or not you use
Android Studio, it's fine with me.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,260
To make the code work,
I created a new project and

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,270
then I modified the activity
main layout file so that it

11
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,080
would have a bunch of views with these
ID's that we're going to be referencing.

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,780
I'm not even sure what this
layout would look like, but

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
I just wanted to put the views in here
with the corresponding view ID names.

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,210
That way, my code will work here.

15
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,570
So for number one, I pasted the code
here, and I see that there's an error.

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,270
Android Studios says it cannot
resolve the method setText.

17
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,780
If you remember from the last video,

18
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,510
I mentioned that setText
is a TextView method.

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,100
That means you can only call
this method on TextView objects.

20
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,920
In this case,
we're calling it on nameTextView.

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,705
A nameTextView is declared
to be a view object,

22
00:01:00,705 --> 00:01:04,057
we need to change this
to be a TextView object.

23
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,942
Then we get an error saying
there is incompatible types.

24
00:01:08,942 --> 00:01:12,390
A textview, an object of type
TextView is required, but

25
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,700
instead it found an object of type view.

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,570
That's because find view
by ID returns a view, and

27
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,950
this left-hand side requires a TextView.

28
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,860
That means we have to add this to cast

29
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,730
the view returned by
findViewById into a TextView.

30
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,800
Then we can store this whole thing,

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,090
which is the nameTextView,
into the left-hand side variable.

32
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:40,760
Then the error goes away, and we can
set text, "Laura" on this TextView.

33
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,510
The error is on line 1, so
I wrote the correct code right here.

34
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:49,540
The general explanation is that we need
to cast this view into a TextView and

35
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,050
then store that inside
a nameTextView variable.

36
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,340
That way,
we can call nameTextView.setText,

37
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,850
which is a TextView method,
on the next line of code here.

38
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,830
Let's move on to number two.

39
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,290
I'm going to copy this code and
put it into Android Studio.

40
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,590
Here's the code I pasted in.

41
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,620
The first line of code seems to
be correct, there's no errors.

42
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,550
But the second line has
a red underline and

43
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,420
it says there's
an incompatible types error.

44
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,990
It says, a string is required but
instead it found an int.

45
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,290
To understand this better,

46
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,250
we should look up the method getMaxLines
within the TextView documentation.

47
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,580
In the TextView documentation,
I'm going to search for

48
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,650
the getMaxLines method.

49
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,770
And here it is.

50
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,120
There's no input parameters, and

51
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,520
the return value of this
method is an integer.

52
00:02:34,758 --> 00:02:38,194
So that's why Android studio was
complaining, because this method,

53
00:02:38,194 --> 00:02:39,911
if it's returning an integer, but

54
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:42,700
we were trying to store it
into a String variable.

55
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,870
As a result, I need to change this data
type of the variable to be an int.

56
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,470
Then the error goes away.

57
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,620
So, the return value of
this method is an integer.

58
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,060
So, we can store it inside
this maxLines variable.

59
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,870
There is a warning still remaining.

60
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,870
Saying that the variable
maxLines is never used.

61
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,260
But this is just a code snippet.

62
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,760
I assume that if this
was in a regular app we

63
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,740
would actually want to
use this variable later.

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,380
So, the error's on line two and
here's the updated code.

65
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,340
The general explanation is that
the return value of this method should

66
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,480
be an integer.

67
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,620
Let's move on to number three.

68
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,830
Here's a code for number three.

69
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,960
I copied and pasted the code for
number three in Android Studio.

70
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,812
There's an error message that
says incompatible types.

71
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:29,400
An ImageView was required,
but instead it found a view.

72
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,740
This is similar to the error
we just saw with the TextView.

73
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,960
This method returns a view.

74
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,270
And, on the left-hand side, we're
trying to store it inside an ImageView.

75
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:42,370
So we need to cast this view
object into an ImageView.

76
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,330
This is valid because the view with
the ID icon actually is an ImageView,

77
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,630
so it's okay to cast
it into an image view.

78
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,560
Now that the right-hand side
evaluates to an ImageView,

79
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,700
we can store that into the variable
on the left-hand side.

80
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,770
This variable has a data type ImageView
so now everything matches up and

81
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,430
the error is gone.

82
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,640
On the next side,
we can call an ImageView method,

83
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,180
SetImageResource, onto
this IconImageView object.

84
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,830
There is one remaining error saying
that it cannot resolve symbol logo.

85
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:17,310
That's because I just didn't add
an image in our app with the name logo.

86
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,410
If I added that, then the error would
go away, so our code here is correct.

87
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,400
Here's the correct code where I
cast this view into an ImageView.

88
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,330
Lastly, we have number 4.

89
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,080
I pasted the code here in Android Studio
and surprisingly there's no errors.

90
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,960
The code is trying to find
a view with the id title, and

91
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,150
that should return a view, and that gets
stored in this variable called TextView.

92
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,900
TextView has a data type of View, so

93
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,940
that matches with the right-hand side,
so this whole line of code is correct.

94
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,410
On the next line we're taking
this object, which is a View And

95
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,410
we're calling a setVisibility
method on it.

96
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,763
The method takes in one input
parameter which is View.GONE.

97
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:02,790
I can check the documentation
to verify why that is.

98
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,050
In the documentation for
the view class, I can search for

99
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,400
the method setVisibility.

100
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,970
I can see that setVisibility is
a method within the view class.

101
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,310
It takes this input, an integer that
represents the visibility state.

102
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,175
The possible visibility values
are VISIBLE, INVISIBLE, and GONE.

103
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:24,490
Since setVisibility is a method
within the view class,

104
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,320
this is a valid call here.

105
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,280
There's no need to cast
this into a TextView

106
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,200
because the method that we're calling
is a method of the view class.

107
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,010
Now if we were trying to
use a TextView method,

108
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,860
then we would need to
cast it to a TextView.

109
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,600
So for this question,
you should put no error, because

110
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,930
setVisibility is a View method, and
it's okay to leave it as a View object.

111
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,480
These were hard questions.

112
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,860
It's okay if you didn't
get them correct.

113
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,080
In the next test, you'll have
a chance to practice this more.
