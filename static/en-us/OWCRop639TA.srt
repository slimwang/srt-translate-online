1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So, we've just learned about what's probably the most important

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
piece of math for this class in statistics called Bayes Rule.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It was invented by Reverend Thomas Bayes, who was a British mathematician

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and a Presbyterian minister in the 18th century.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Bayes Rule is usually stated as follows: P of A given B where B is the evidence

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and A is the variable we care about is P of B given A times P of A over P of B.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This expression is called the likelihood.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is called the prior, and this is called marginal likelihood.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The expression over here is called the posterior.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The interesting thing here is the way the probabilities are reworded.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Say we have evidence B.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We know about B, but we really care about the variable A.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So, for example, B is a test result.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We don't care about the test result as much as we care about the fact

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
whether we have cancer or not.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This diagnostic reasoning--which is from evidence to its causes--

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
is turned upside down by Bayes Rule into a causal reasoning,

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
which is given--hypothetically, if we knew the cause,

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
what would be the probability of the evidence we just observed.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But to correct for this inversion, we have to multiply

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
by the prior of the cause to be the case in the first place,

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
in this case, having cancer or not,

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and divide it by the probability of the evidence, P(B),

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
which often is expanded using the theorem of total probability as follows.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The probability of B is a sum over all probabilities of B

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
conditional on A, lower caps a, times the probability of A equals lower caps a.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This is total probability as we already encountered it.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So, let's apply this to the cancer case

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and say we really care about whether you have cancer,

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
which is our cause, conditioned on the evidence

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
that is the result of this hidden cause, in this case, a positive test result.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's just plug in the numbers.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Our likelihood is the probability of seeing a positive test result

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
given that you have cancer multiplied by the prior probability

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
of having cancer over the probability of the positive test result,

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and that is--according to the tables we looked at before--

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
0.9 times a prior of 0.01 over--

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
now we're going to expand this right over here according to total probability

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
which gives us 0.9 times 0.01.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's the probability of + given that we do have cancer.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So, the probability of + given that we don't have cancer is 0.2,

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
but the prior here is 0.99.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So, if we plug in the numbers we know about, we get 0.009

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
over 0.009 + 0.198.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That is approximately 0.0434, which is the number we saw before.
