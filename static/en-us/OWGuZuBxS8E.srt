1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,230
So, that's gradient descent. As we mentioned, gradient descent is

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,330
just one machine learning technique and one of the most basic.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,780
There are a number of sophisticated machine learning algorithms for

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,290
predicting and classifying our data points. And if this is interesting

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,239
to you, I'd really recommend you to go out there

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,690
and read more about machine learning, and really dive into some

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,070
of those algorithms. Let's talk about Assignment 3. In this

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,545
assignment, you'll use methods we learned during this lesson. So the

9
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:29,340
t-test and linear regression using gradient descent, to make some conclusions

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,070
and predictions about our data. First you'll use the t-test in

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,620
order to compare various sub sets of our subway data to

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,700
try and make some conclusions about subway ridership. For example, do

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,000
people ride the subway more if it's raining? Or maybe they

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,160
ride more if it's the weekend. Then we'll use linear regression

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,130
to try and build a model that predicts how many total

16
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,980
riders the New York City subway will have. On a particular

17
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,700
day and time, given a variety of factors. For example, the time of

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,540
day, whether or not it's a weekday, how the weather is, et cetera.
