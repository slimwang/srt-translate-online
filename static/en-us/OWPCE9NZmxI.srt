00:00:00,257 --> 00:00:04,323
Very cool. Alright, here's how my verify algorithm works.

2
00:00:04,323 --> 00:00:08,323
First, I make sure that we have a mapping

3
00:00:08,323 --> 00:00:09,888
from all of the nodes of the graph to--

4
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:12,407
Hmm, I didn't check everything-- Well here's what I checked

5
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:14,956
Make sure that the number of nodes in the coloring

6
00:00:14,956 --> 00:00:16,472
matches the number of nodes in the graph.

7
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:18,323
If not, then this is not a good coloring.

8
00:00:18,323 --> 00:00:22,539
Then for each node in the coloring list,

9
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:26,389
well, if it's the case that the coloring for the node

10
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:30,658
is not a valid color, then we say that's bad

11
00:00:30,658 --> 00:00:34,172
and then we check all of the neighbors of the node,

12
00:00:34,172 --> 00:00:38,506
and we check for each combination of node and its neighbor,

13
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:40,190
whether the colorings match, and if any of the

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,089
colorings match, that's bad, because that means

15
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:44,007
two adjacent regions with the same color,

16
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:45,440
so we return false.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,556
And if we survive all of those tests,

18
00:00:47,556 --> 00:00:50,524
then at the end of the day we return 'true'.

19
00:00:50,524 --> 00:00:52,588
The thing that I didn't check for that I probably

20
00:00:52,588 --> 00:00:54,339
should have checked for, is to make sure that

21
00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:58,372
the nodes that are in use in the certificate,

22
00:00:58,372 --> 00:01:00,658
are the same as the nodes that in use in the graph.

23
00:01:00,658 --> 00:01:02,056
That would be kind of weird.

24
00:01:02,056 --> 00:01:04,271
Or, if it has nodes that aren't in the graph,

25
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:07,889
then this will actually crash, which is not good,

26
00:01:07,889 --> 00:01:09,290
so I probably should have checked for that.

27
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,622
But the essence of it is just this:

28
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:14,533
We're running through all of the edges in the graph,

29
00:01:14,533 --> 99:59:59,999
and making sure that the colors don't match.
