00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,858
So for this I'm going to want you guys to fill in the chart that I'm about to

2
00:00:02,858 --> 00:00:06,900
make. Now first, we know that our Nervous System is divided into two main

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,487
areas. One, that deals with our outside body. An the other that's responsible

4
00:00:12,487 --> 00:00:17,250
for our brain an spinal cord. Then we further divide this system into two more.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,533
One that deals with sensory information and one that deals with our involuntary

6
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:24,802
systems. We divide the involuntary system into the Sympathetic and the

7
00:00:24,802 --> 00:00:29,638
Parasympathetic. One of these systems brings us back to normal and the other

8
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:35,150
system is responsible for the flight or fight response. Here are your options,

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,840
the Somatic Nervous System, back to normal, Central Nervous System, Autonomic

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,872
Nervous System, fight or flight, Peripheral Nervous System. Type in the answers

11
00:00:45,872 --> 00:00:46,939
in these blanks.
