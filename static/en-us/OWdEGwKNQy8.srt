1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,950
Now, I'm going to just try to outline the different things we will cover in

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:03,730
this class.

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,370
First module of this class is introduction.

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,430
We will talk about, what is computational photography?

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,020
I'll just give you an example of a kind of a,

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,510
a newer type of a camera that has been an artifact that's been produced, as we

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,950
have started diving deeper into the whole concept of computational photography.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,350
We will learn more about what are different artifacts of

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,520
computational photography, and

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,070
what I'll do in this module is introduce you to two simple concepts.

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,460
Well, actually, they are not that simple, but some concepts that actually would

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,800
be valuable for you to kind of remember throughout the course and

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,940
these will be the things that I'll kind of use as examples throughout,

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,690
will help us understand how we are going to do computational photography.

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,430
I'm going to provide some sort of a context on the scope of

16
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,770
what is computation and how does it really relate to all the other disciplines.

17
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,325
As I've stated, computational photography is a discipline of it's own now, has

18
00:00:56,325 --> 00:01:00,860
its own conference and publications and stuff like that in the academic manner.

19
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,579
But of course what we're interested in

20
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,180
is learning what other disciplines impacted.

21
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,110
In this one, in the first, when we get started,

22
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,900
initial weeks, we'll have a couple of assignments for you.

23
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,430
One to get started basically doing simple processing with images and

24
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,100
stuff like that.
