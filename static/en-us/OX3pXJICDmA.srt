1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,070
The correct answers are number one and number three.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,540
Using a principle component analysis,

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,640
we could probably find the features that are more important that others.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,980
We could also scale the features such that the numerical values of

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,600
the variations they have are similar.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,250
And thus, it is easier for the model to make a distinction.
