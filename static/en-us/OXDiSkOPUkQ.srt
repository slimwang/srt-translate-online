1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:04,735
So how do we know that? Well, researchers gathered data from people who worked

2
00:00:04,735 --> 00:00:08,215
closely with animals for a long period of time and particular species of

3
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:15,062
animals. Such as animal trainers, zoo keepers, and wildlife experts. The key

4
00:00:15,062 --> 00:00:19,149
was that people had to be very familiar with many individuals of a certain

5
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:25,533
species, so they could rate unique behavioral tendencies, that is personality.

6
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:29,949
What they found was that members of the same species acted in unique ways over

7
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:35,669
a long period of time. That is they possess unique personality traits and

8
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:40,633
surprisingly the dimensions of personality that we use for humans is relatively

9
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:46,981
similar to those seen in animals. Let's look at this figure, here we see we

10
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:54,368
have ocean. So open this to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion,

11
00:00:54,368 --> 00:01:00,908
agreeableness and neuroticism. Here we see that these animals have a unique

12
00:01:00,908 --> 00:01:06,668
trait of openness so they vary in their openness to new experiences. We see

13
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:12,602
consciousness in chimpanzees and horses. So within these two species, there's a

14
00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:18,060
variation of how conscientious different animals are. As for extroversion, we

15
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,533
see that nearly all of the animals, except the hyena, rat and chickadee show

16
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:29,164
variations in being extroverted. Similar to extroversion we see agreeableness

17
00:01:29,164 --> 00:01:35,458
is seen in many animals, except for guppies, chickadees and octopus. And for

18
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:40,499
neurotocism, we see that many animals exhibit this feature, except for a few.
