00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,940
Now that we know when the player
gets hit by an icicle,

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,670
let's start keeping score.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,620
We'll say that the players' score
is the number of icicles that

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,010
fall off the screen
without hitting them.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,030
Right now though, we don't have a way
to tell the user what their score is.

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,600
Let's fix that by adding
a head up display or HUD.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,340
That's really just
a fancy way of saying,

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,060
let's throw some text into the corners
of the screen showing the score.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,560
Check out the to-do's in
the course code to add the HUD.
