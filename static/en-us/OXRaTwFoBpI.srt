Smoking cigarettes is one way in which some people reduce stress. And it may be

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,735
the case because the active ingredient in cigarettes, nicotine, actually

3
00:00:08,735 --> 00:00:14,176
relaxes skelatal muscles. This is why people say smoking relaxes them. However,

4
00:00:14,176 --> 00:00:19,152
we also know that nicotine activates the sympathetic nervous system. This

5
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:23,272
causes increase in heart rate and blood pressure. And, you recall, that this is

6
00:00:23,272 --> 00:00:27,678
not good for extended period of time. As you recall from our lesson on

7
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:31,390
consciousness and drugs, many people use alcohol as a way to self medicate or

8
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:37,374
to reduce their stress. Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant and it

9
00:00:37,374 --> 00:00:42,548
actually causes relaxation in the short run. However, long term use of alcohol

10
00:00:42,548 --> 00:00:46,076
can result in a variety of negative effects, including damage to the heart,

11
00:00:46,076 --> 00:00:49,324
cirrhosis of the liver, negative effects on the brain, in addition to

12
00:00:49,324 --> 00:00:54,110
physiological, as well as psychological dependence.
