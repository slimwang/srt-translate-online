00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,702
Let me show you my solution. First of all, notice in BlueJ, that the dog,

2
00:00:03,702 --> 00:00:09,333
house, and car class, implement a drawable interface. You see that with these

3
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:14,764
little arrows with a triangle on the end. If we open up one of them then we'll

4
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:22,152
see the implements class over here. Now let's look at the scene class. Note

5
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:26,386
that we now have a single ArrayList, everything gets added to that one

6
00:00:26,386 --> 00:00:32,573
ArrayList and we just have one loop. So you can see how interfaces dramatically

7
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:38,514
simplified this program. What made it all work? The fact that you can convert

8
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:45,098
from an object of a class to the interface type. In this case drawable. And so

9
00:00:45,098 --> 00:00:49,823
all these elements were convertible to drawable and then to draw them we can

10
00:00:49,823 --> 00:00:56,135
invoke the draw method on each element. We know they all have a draw method

11
00:00:56,135 --> 00:01:01,984
because they're all drawables. Sara has a few exercises prepared to make sure

12
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:06,260
that you understand when you can and when you can't convert between two types.

13
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,400
And then, she will show you a new interface that expresses when an item is

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,390
likable in a social network.
