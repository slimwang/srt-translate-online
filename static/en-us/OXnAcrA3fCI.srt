00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,420
Let's look again at our code for computing the largest

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,220
value. We duplicate the lines asking the user to enter a

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,770
value. Can we avoid this special case for entering the

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,040
value the first time? What if, instead of initializing largest with

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,260
the first double, we initialize it as 0? Will this

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,080
work? Yes, it will work. It will fail if only one

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,820
input is provided. It will fail if the data set

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,060
contains 0. Or it will just fail for some data sets.
