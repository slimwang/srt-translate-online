00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520
Today, network file systems are an

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,490
important component of any computing environment, be

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,130
it a corporate setting or university setting.

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,610
There are companies that have sprung up

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:19,070
such as NetApp solely to pedal scalable NFS products. In this lesson, going

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,480
beyond NFS we learned a lot of

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,870
concepts pertaining to the design and implementation

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,850
of distributed file systems, in particular

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,830
how to make the implementation scalable

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,770
by removing centralization and utilizing memory

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,090
that's available in the nodes of a

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,530
local area network intelligently. Such techniques

13
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,070
for identifying and removing bottlenecks are the

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:51,390
reusable nuggets that we can take and apply to the design and implementation

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,330
of other distributed subsystems in additions to file systems themselves.

16
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:01,190
Overall, in the set of papers that we studied in

17
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:06,710
this lesson module spanning, GSM, DSM and DFS,

18
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,480
we discussed the design and implementation of subsystems that found creative

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,390
ways to fully utilize memory that's available in the nodes

20
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,520
of a local area network.
