1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,450
Here's another example of partial derivatives.

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,880
So here we have another animal that tends to have stripes.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,200
Although, I would not get as close to this one.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,950
So first question.

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,960
Which one is the x and which one is the y?

6
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,260
Well, let's see.

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,320
Again, we have some vertical stripes here.

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,290
And we see them right there really strongly.

9
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,590
So that changes as you go to the x.

10
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,260
And they don't show up over here so much.

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,860
But here we have horizontal stripes, all right, that show up nicely.

12
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,670
You probably figured out by now that on the left hand side we have the partial

13
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,490
with respect to x.

14
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,150
On the right hand side, the partial respect to y.

15
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,990
And in fact if you take a look at this, you'll see that, and

16
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,470
I'm going to make sure I put these in the right way, is that when I get to this,

17
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,090
this edge right there, which is this edge right there.

18
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,340
That as it gets brighter, that value goes high.

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,290
So the filter that I'm using here is this minus 1, plus 1 correlation filter.

20
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,520
I take that value at my right,

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,640
subtract off the one from my left and that's the value.

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,910
And now, correlation versus convolution matters.

23
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,390
Because if I swapped it around, things would be different.

24
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,320
On the y side it's also going to be plus 1 or minus 1, but I write it like this.

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,490
And the reason that I do that is,

26
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,470
one of these is the filter that you would use for computing the y gradient.

27
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,900
But whether it's the one on the left or

28
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,830
the one on the right will depend if whether in your universe you make y go

29
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,710
up positively or you make it go down positively.

30
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,140
And that's a choice that you get to make.

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,220
You can put the origin of your image in the top left hand corner like

32
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,300
computer scientists tend to think about them or in the bottom left hand

33
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,910
corner like mathematicians for thousands of years have done that.

34
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,630
Only computer scientists would screw with that, but we did.

35
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,780
So you, you'll probably have to figure it out which way y is in your world and

36
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,350
then apply the right filter.

37
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,710
By the way, I can take the magnitude of this.

38
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,980
That is just take the, the sum of the squares and

39
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,100
take the square root, and I would end up with a picture that looks like that.

40
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,350
And that should start to give you a hint as to where we're headed because that

41
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,610
looks an awful lot like an edge image.
