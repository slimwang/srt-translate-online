You've made it to the end
of this session on arrays.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,870
Arrays are a wonderful
collection type in Swift.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,600
They're easy to create, easy to modify,
and easy to iterate through.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,320
And rest assured, you'll be using
them a lot in your apps to represent

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,670
multiple values and instances.

6
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:14,590
We'll see in the next session.
