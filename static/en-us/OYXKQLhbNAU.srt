1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,930
All right, that ends today's, relatively short lesson.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,740
We've just, a flavor of projective geometry.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,000
There are entire, I want to say books,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,140
there are entire lifetimes dedicated to projective geometry, mostly in France.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,802
They've got this thing about it.

6
00:00:15,802 --> 00:00:19,402
But in particular, out of France, came from [FOREIGN] group and

7
00:00:19,402 --> 00:00:23,510
others was the application of projected geometry to computer vision.

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,460
And it really revolutionized some of the, the work that was done in terms of

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,630
how people thought about stereo and other types of relationship between views.

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,230
What we're going to do, is we're going to discuss,

11
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,880
we're going to use this a little bit in our next two lectures where we

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,960
talk about what's called the essential matrix, and the fundamental matrix.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,370
Those are a little more intense, so hang on.
