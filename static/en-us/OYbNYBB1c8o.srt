In the last quiz I mentioned that Pong
was one of the first video games, but

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,680
it wasn't the first.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,820
So, what was the first
widely available video game,

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,100
according to Wikipedia anyway?

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,510
As a hint, we will require correct
punctuation in the name of the game.
