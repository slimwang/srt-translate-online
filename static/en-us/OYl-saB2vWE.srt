1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,880
Before you answer questions about all that you've learned so

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,660
far, I want you to hear from Scott and Cole again.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,610
They're going to share some amazing resources so

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,030
that you can create great data visualizations.

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,190
What tools or resources would you recommend that students use?

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,500
>> There are things like D3, right.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,620
There are like JavaScript libraries and these tools that are built.

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,290
To help you build totally customized visualizations.

9
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,870
So that's sort of like on the advanced end.

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,940
On the other hand you have tools that are a little more like create, kind of

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:34,570
create a canned visualizations like a chart wizard built into Microsoft Excel.

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,760
>> Mm. >> Or.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,370
Or also like OpenOffice or LibreOffice, like these other sort of office type

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,660
programs, which are really great, or Apple's Numbers does more things.

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,230
Tableau I think is a fantastic tool for starting out and they just came out with

16
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:53,700
a Mac version, which is great, as it opens it up to a lot of us who use Macs,

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,250
and Tableau, I, I don't want to say it makes like, they're not like

18
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,390
canned visualizations but it lets you just like, really fast, drop a data set on

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,960
there and give yourself like a number of visual representations of that data.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,630
So you're like, oh show me this as a bar chart.

21
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,340
Show me, to me as a area chart, line chart, whatever.

22
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,260
Or if this is geographic data like, show me this data on a map.

23
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,460
Like in a really fast way.

24
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:22,100
So that's an awesome, sort of like exploratory tool and on the technical side,

25
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,200
you know, there's like the other end of the spectrum from D3.

26
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:31,190
Now in-between, there's a lot of stuff in-between like other chart libraries or

27
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,270
online tools.

28
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:36,240
The tools I think I'm excited about right now are sort of in this.

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,830
In between place where, where they

30
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,300
let you sort of dump your data in and generate some sort of visualization.

31
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,810
But it's not trying to be the final visualization.

32
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,170
And then you export that, bring it in to some other tool, and

33
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,890
start adjusting it.

34
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,840
So for example there's a tool out of the Density Design Lab.

35
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,440
In Italy called RAW.

36
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,886
>> Hm. >> That's capital R-A-W.

37
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:01,540
>> Mm-hm.

38
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,520
>> And you put some, basically drop your data on it and

39
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,229
it figures out sort of this is a representation I think will work.

40
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,060
But it doesn't give you, and, and it's all, like ,in one page.

41
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,190
It's kind of like one, two, three.

42
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,360
You just go down this list and then you get, like, a graphic of some sort.

43
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,720
And then you take that graphic, and you export it, and maybe bring it into

44
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,970
Illustrator, or some other program where you can do kind of the manual steps.

45
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,660
So then you can say, oh can we not set my, my fills and

46
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,680
strokes and then reposition things.

47
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,100
I think that's like, really nice and

48
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,380
really powerful, because it, it doesn't involve any coding.

49
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,720
It doesn't involve a steep learning curve.

50
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,100
And it also doesn't burden you with an interface that gives you a million like,

51
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,360
options for customization.

52
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,010
>> Mm. >> It's just saying I'm just going to get you started and

53
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,050
like get you past that initial push so you have this one graphic and

54
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,570
then you can take it and tweak it.

55
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,699
So there's a lot of exciting stuff like that I think that you can use.

56
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,320
So what tools or resources would you recommend for students who are getting

57
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,740
started be it maybe it's a blog or a particular software tool that you use.

58
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,930
>> Sure so when it comes to tools I think my number one piece of

59
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,760
advice is try not to let your tool be a limiting factor.

60
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,190
>> Mm. >> Right. Take the tool that you know and

61
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,950
get to know it as well as you can.

62
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,030
Most tools can be bent to meet your needs and

63
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,480
you can add more tools to your repertoire over time.

64
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,020
But, the knowledge of fancy tools need not be a barrier for entry in this space.

65
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,550
I, for example, do almost all of my work in Excel.

66
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,220
Because, it's still the most pervasive for business communications,

67
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,760
which is where I spend the majority of my time.

68
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,540
When it comes to other resources out there, there is a wealth of information in

69
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,610
the blogosphere, an a lot of really great content.

70
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,920
One word of advise, is there's a lot of not great content as well,

71
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,180
so be a discerning.

72
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,500
Purveyor of data visualizations, right?

73
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,580
When you come across a graph in a newspaper or

74
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,120
in a blog, study it and note what you like and what you don't like.

75
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,710
And work to emulate those things that you see in other people's work that works

76
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,090
well and avoid the bad.

77
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,490
When it comes to some specific blogs that I'd recommend, and

78
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,230
again there are a whole lot of good ones out there, but

79
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,180
I'll go through just a couple of my favorites today.

80
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,440
First off is the Functional Art.

81
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,920
So this is done by Alberto Cairo,

82
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,519
he has a book of the same name that we talked about briefly.

83
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,330
Next is Visualizing Data which, which Andy Kirk runs.

84
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,220
Flowing Data is Nathan Yau's blog and

85
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,870
he curates a lot of stuff that other people do and.

86
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,930
Yeah, another good example.

87
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,760
And then I would be remiss not to mention my own blog at Storytelling with Data.

88
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,690
And actually one more resource while we're flipping through pages here

89
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,430
is John Schwab's Help Me Viz.

90
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,090
So we talked earlier about seeking feedback.

91
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,400
This is a place where you can actually submit data visualizations and

92
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,960
get feedback from the community and has been growing and

93
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,510
has some really good content.

94
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,480
Also if you're interested in just looking for data visualizations and

95
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,800
examples of good stuff and bad stuff, it's, a nice place to flip through.

96
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,300
>> Wonderful.
