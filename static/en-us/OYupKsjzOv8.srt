00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,290
Diving into the visual metaphors
that we used in this course,

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,230
I want to ask some questions.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,100
How the internet service architecture
designs that we just described

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,540
translate in the context
of the toy shop.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,900
Consider a toy shop where every worker
knows how to build any type of toy, so

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,770
this is like the homogeneous
architecture example.

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,450
If the rate at which new orders
are arriving starts increasing,

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,990
how will you keep this homogeneous
architecture balanced?

9
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,700
Note that this quiz is open-ended,
and also as a hint,

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:36,550
you may want to think about answering
the quiz by saying add more of what.
