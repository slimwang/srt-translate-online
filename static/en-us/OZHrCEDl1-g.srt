1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,520
>> You know, one of the things we, both of us have

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,760
talked about for a long time is the importance of a conceptual model.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,660
>> True.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,270
>> And, the fact that, you know, the designer has some model of

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,510
what this thing is, and the person using it is trying to figure out

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:19,690
what the model is, and the only thing to go on is the device itself. And,

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,698
you said, you had trouble with this. And it looks to me

8
00:00:25,698 --> 00:00:29,810
like it's a pretty straightforward bowl, so what's the story?

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:34,060
>> Well I, I came across this at a hotel in, in Stockholm, Sweden. They

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,780
had a whole big stack of them jumbled up for us to put our breakfast cereal

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,060
in. And so, I made the mistake of putting my breakfast cereal in it. I happen to

12
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:51,260
have some cereal here. [SOUND] I poured the the cereal into the bowl, and

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:56,970
then I added some milk. And I do like my milk, so.

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,132
>> All the way up to the rim.

15
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:03,432
>> Yeah, because that's just the way I like it

16
00:01:03,432 --> 00:01:07,904
and then I put it down on the table. [NOISE]

17
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:09,918
>> [LAUGH].

18
00:01:09,918 --> 00:01:16,469
>> Because the base of the bowl is at an angle to where the bowl is.

19
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,820
>> Now that does not require an, a warning notice. That requires a redesign.

20
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,140
>> So the conceptual model of a bowl is that it's flat.

21
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,670
>> Yes.

22
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,724
>> And horizontal. And you.

23
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:31,087
>> [CROSSTALK] And that's what people expect.

24
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:32,788
>> And as long as you're holding it this way, it looks like it is, right?

25
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:36,080
>> Yes, and particularly the way it was jumbled one bowl on top of the other.

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,242
>> Right, so, and actually.

27
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:37,600
>> [CROSSTALK] And there was nothing that let you know.

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,490
>> You were, you were holding it in your hand when you

29
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,930
filled it. If you had filled it while it was on the table,

30
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:43,860
>> Right.

31
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,010
>> Then it would have been okay.

32
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:45,250
>> Yes.

33
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,505
>> Except, you maybe couldn't have put as milk in as you want.

34
00:01:47,505 --> 00:01:51,140
>> Yeah, but this is a breakfast buffet, so you're standing there with the

35
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,660
bowl in your hand. Now what was it, it was intended for was to

36
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:01,590
make a nice presentation for having the chef fill this bowl and then a

37
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,930
waiter bring it out to your table. So they pressed it into a different service.
