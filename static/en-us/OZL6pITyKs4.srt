1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,010
So, here you have a picture of Einstein.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,560
And each one of these is a different octave.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,740
So cut in half, cut in half, cut in half.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,440
And then you can see we go from crisp to blurrier, to blurry, to blurry.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,950
It's probably the only time Einstein was fuzzy in his life.

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,790
And then, just as we showed in this picture before.

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,900
We can subtract example these two, and get that difference, all right?

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,770
Or we can subtract these two, and get that difference, right?

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,320
So, these are our difference of gaussian images.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,890
And then what we can do is we can take each pixel in one of these and

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,240
compare it to its neighbors in space and its neighbors in scale.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,010
Then when you do all of that, you can find the extrema and it looks like that.

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,220
So, this is an Einstein picture with really bad dots.

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,570
But some of those extrema might be higher than their neighbors but

15
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,310
not very high.

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,570
This happens in Colorado.

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,400
So, you want to make sure that the contrast or

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,910
that value is higher than a particular amount.

19
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,270
So you say, ah-ha, here are places with contrast.

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,295
But we say, wait a minute, we said before that when we use Laplacian and

21
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:05,890
Gaussians, we might have nice contrast but

22
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,420
it might be high just in one direction.

23
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,160
So along an edge.

24
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,210
So what do we do?

25
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,370
We remove the edges and voila, these are our detectors, okay.

26
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,270
And what's important here is these are detectors that are robust with

27
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,030
respect to scale.

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,430
Because we pulled out all the extrema at all the different scales.

29
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,960
And this was David Sieff detector.

30
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,540
So this can be written sort of like this.

31
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,380
So for scale invariant detectors for SIFT,

32
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,520
here we've shown that you're going to do difference of Gaussians in space and

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,430
difference of Gaussians you're taking the difference of all these Gaussians and

34
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,930
comparing them in space and in scale and you're picking the maxima.

35
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,790
And here's a reference from again the Journal of Computer Vision where he

36
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,950
talks about this.

37
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,560
There is another approach that's quite related.

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,630
It uses both things that we just talked about.

39
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,700
First, you essentially do the Harris corner detection at lots of

40
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,490
different scales.

41
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:07,050
And then you also take a look at the Laplacian in the scale direction.

42
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:16,020
And you find points that are the maximum in space, in the Harris measure.

43
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,440
Right, that's the amount of maximum suppression.

44
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,130
And our maximum in space in scale in the Laplacian direction.

45
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,140
And this is sometimes called the Harris-Laplace detector.

46
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,160
The paper here ICCV is one that's referenced.

47
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:36,620
And you know, I can show you here's a nice little demonstration that had,

48
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,250
with change of scale that, well,

49
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,750
first, you can see the original Harris detector, in fact, does really poorly.

50
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,740
That's what we saw before.

51
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,950
The SIFT detector, that's the thing in the green line.

52
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,230
That was the thing we showed you before,

53
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,870
it does way better than the Harris detector.

54
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,230
But along comes Harris-Laplace, and it does even better.

55
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,360
And so you might say, well, of course we should use Harris-Laplace.

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,680
I will tell you a lot of people do.

57
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,100
I will also tell you that this graph comes from the people who

58
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,060
invented Harris-Laplace, so you know, your mileage may vary.
