00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,840
Congratulations, you've reached
the end of this course.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,910
I hope that you find it interesting and
informative.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,140
And that the behavior of the internet
is a little less mysterious to you than

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:08,820
once it might have been.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,790
I'm going to leave you with one more
story about the importance of speed and

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,670
network bandwidth to the users
of a web application.

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,410
I've put a link to it just below.

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,610
It's a story from Chris Zacharias,
a former YouTube developer.

9
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,340
He tells about how reducing the size
of YouTube's video viewing page

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,460
made the site much more accessible.

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,070
But also that it was hard
at first to see the effect

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,070
without careful measurement.

13
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,910
This story is worth reading and
thinking carefully about.

14
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,370
For anyone who works on large websites
or anything else bandwidth intensive.

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,560
Thanks for your time and
energy taking this course.

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,100
See you around.
