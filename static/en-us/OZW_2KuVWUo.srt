00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Breaking means to apply friction, lots of it, and for breaking it's vital to distinguish

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
between two different regimes of friction--static friction and kinetic friction.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If this object is at rest with respect to that surface, we can apply forces up to a certain threshold force

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
without setting this object in motion, which remains static.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Experiments showed that this threshold of force is a constant times the rate force,

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which often is called N because it's a normal force.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It is perpendicular to the surface. Its coefficient is called the coefficient of static friction Âµs.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
As long as the force that we apply doesn't exceed this force, this object won't be set in motion.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
When this force becomes larger than the threshold, the object will be set in motion.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
For example, if the mass of this object is 1 kg, the gravitational force would be almost 10 N.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
A pretty high value for this coefficient of static friction would be 1,

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
which means that the threshold force is at 1 * 10 N.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It would have to exert a force of 10 N or more to set this object in motion.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If we apply less, it remains static.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Typically, this coefficient of static friction ranges between 1/3 and 1, which means that typically

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
to set an object in motion, we need to apply less force sideways than the force with which

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
gravity pulls that object down.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Things are easier in the kinetic regime.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We need to apply a certain force to keep this object going at a constant velocity.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So this force is nothing else but the force exerted by friction, and from experiments,

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
we find that this force is some constant times the normal force,

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the force exerted by gravity in this case, and this is the coefficient for kinetic friction.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
In the kinetic regime, we got the same expression but it's an equal sign.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In this case it's not a threshold--we compute the force as such.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What's of imminent importance for breaking is that the coefficient of static friction tends to be

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
larger than the coefficient of kinetic friction.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The coefficient of kinetic friction maybe be 1/4 less than the coefficient of static friction

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
or it may even be smaller, and now think about breaking.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We want to apply the maximum amount of friction.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The maximum amount of friction is found in this static regime,

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
because the coefficient of static friction is higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What we need to prevent is the locking of wheels.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
When wheel stays locked, it's sliding on the ground, and we're in the regime of kinetic friction.
