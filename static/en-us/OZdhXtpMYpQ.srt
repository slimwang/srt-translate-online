1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,240
So, enough watching me
tinker with APIs online.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,350
Now, it's time for you to try and

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,260
experiment with API
providers on your own.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,380
These next two quizzes will not only
help you get more accustomed to working

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,560
with APIs, but

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,660
they will also serve as code snippets,
to help you complete the final project.

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,700
Google Maps has a geocoding
feature that can take in a stream

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,540
representation of a location.

9
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,590
And try to find the latitude and
longitude coordinates of that place.

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,610
Use the Google Maps API documentation
to geocode the following

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,510
cities into latitude and
longitude coordinates.

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,680
Use Corel or
to help you make these requests.
