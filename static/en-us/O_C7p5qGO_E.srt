00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Today, we're going to be talking about customer relationships.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In other words, how do you get, keep and grow customers.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So in the last lecture, you remember the business model canvas, all the 9 components of a startup.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We talked about value proposition, we talked about customer segments,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
we talked about channels, but today we're going to focus on customer relationships.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Customer relationships really is about how do you get customers, how do you keep customers,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and how do you grow them.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Here are two get, keep and grow funnels, and the one thing to note is just the one on the top

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
represents a physical channel and the one on the bottom is web/mobile

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and the thing to just remember is at physical channel is we're going to see later of the details

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
inside of how you get or acquire customers are different

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
than how you would acquire customers in web/mobile.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Just know that the physical representation of the customer's life cycle--get, keep and grow,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
is kind of this double-barreled funnel and that's why we draw this way.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It just allows you to kind of understand how do customers get into our company,

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
how do we get them, how do we keep them, and how do we grow them.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And so let's look at both of these get, keep and grow for

18
00:01:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
physical and web/mobile channels in a little more detail.
