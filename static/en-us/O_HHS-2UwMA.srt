1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,360
So this is the situation we have for dispatch. This is what we're

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,530
broadcasting this cycle. This is what we have in our reservation stations. And

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,360
the question is why hasn't this instruction here in,

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,100
RS3 dispatched before this? Because, obviously, it's not waiting for

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,660
anything at this point. So the question is, if this is a beginning of a cycle,

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,450
then why hasn't this already executed before we got to this cycle?

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,020
The first choice is, it was issued in the previous cycle. So basically,

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,970
this says that this instruction was inserted here in the previous cycle, so

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:41,360
that's why it didn't dispatch yet. The next answer is, another instruction was

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,890
dispatched to the add unit, so this one couldn't. And the third answer is

11
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,150
that if the instruction in RS2 is older than the instruction in RS3,

12
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:55,020
it comes before it in program order, than RS3 cannot dispatch until RS2 does, so

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,170
simple, this instruction cannot dispatch because it's waiting for something.

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,890
In this quiz, you need to, select all answers that would possibly be correct.
