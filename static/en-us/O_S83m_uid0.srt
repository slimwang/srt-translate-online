1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,390
Now we're going to write Click Counter
without any help from Storyboard.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,590
You'll begin by creating
a fresh project.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,650
We're going to use the Single View
template in this case.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,990
And remember if you need help,

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,750
you can always follow the steps
in the instructor notes.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,776
Here I've opened
the ViewController.swift file in

7
00:00:14,776 --> 00:00:15,876
the Click Counter project.

8
00:00:15,876 --> 00:00:20,230
If your ViewController.swift file has
extra methods when you first open it,

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,370
go ahead and delete them.

10
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,810
The template automatically creates
those, but we don't need them right now.

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,010
Our next goal is to write swift
statements that will create the subviews

12
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,650
for the label and the button.

13
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,659
We can put the code here in viewDidLoad.

14
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,530
You may remember from course
one that this executes once,

15
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,820
after the initial view object is set.

16
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,060
Let's start with the label.

17
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,040
We can allocate it and
initialize it here.

18
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,140
Without Storyboard,

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,700
we're going to have to position
our label on the screen with code.

20
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,130
All views have a frame property
that we can use to do this.

21
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,770
And we can use the method
CGRectMake to set the x and

22
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,580
y coordinates here and
also the height and width.

23
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,144
So I'll go ahead and set our label's
text to 0, and then try running it.

24
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,265
>> Okay.

25
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,470
So we're not seeing anything yet.

26
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,450
That's because we still need to add our
label's view to the view hierarchy.

27
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,710
That way the label's view is
associated with our existing view.

28
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,204
So here I'll call up the view property,
add the label as a Subview, and

29
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,910
that's, let's try running it again.

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,240
Awesome!

31
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,090
We can see our label now.

32
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,210
We can do similar work with the button,
so let's go ahead and

33
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,850
add some comments so
that our code's a little more organized.

34
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,166
So here I'm setting the button's frame,
setting the title,

35
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:38,586
giving that title a color
we can actually see, and

36
00:01:38,586 --> 00:01:42,754
then adding the button's view
as a Subview of our real view.

37
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:45,171
And, now we run it again.

38
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,980
And now we can see our button and
our label.

39
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,170
Not too bad for a few lines of code.
