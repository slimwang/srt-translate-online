Here is 1 cup of sugar and I know 3 4ths of a cup makes 1 batch of brownies.

00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:08,334
Here's another cup of sugar and I know this 3 4ths cup of sugar makes another

00:00:08,346 --> 00:00:12,218
batch of brownies. So, I know I can at least make 2 batches of brownies. I

00:00:12,302 --> 00:00:16,111
haven't used 2 full cups yet. I actually have some sugar that I can still use.

00:00:16,207 --> 00:00:20,304
So, I know I could've made more then 2 batches of brownies. If you chose more

00:00:20,316 --> 00:00:21,693
than 2 batches, great job.
