1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,020
Turns out that there are some other rectangular grids,

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,630
it's really nice when somebody spray paints the rectangular grid.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,620
Here you're seeing a movie, of a American football play, in fact,

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,650
this is a college football play.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,190
But you'll notice they're running around on a plane because to play football,

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,560
on bumpy things is hard.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,280
All right?

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,159
So since it's a plane, we can rectify that to a different plane.

9
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:28,404
In particular, what about the plane that you would see if

10
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,440
you were looking sort of overhead?

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,299
Okay?

12
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:38,700
So what we've done is, this is just the same frame, mapped to a different view,

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,702
where we've taken these lines which converge and we've made them all parallel.

14
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:44,160
All right.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,466
Now you'll notice that all the points go to the right place,

16
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:53,120
except, the players of course, right, they are not on a plane.

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,074
Just their feet are on the plane, so

18
00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:59,503
their feet go to the right place, but the players themselves are stretched out,

19
00:00:59,503 --> 00:01:02,230
because the players are not on the plane.

20
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,830
But what we did is we applied the entire homography, the, sorry.

21
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,460
We applied the homography to the entire image, so everything on the football

22
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,150
field went to the right place, the players went to a slightly different place.

23
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,940
But you'll notice, if you look at this, you could see exactly what's going on.

24
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,820
Here you see two videos playing at the same time, one is the play as

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,010
observed by the camera, the other one is this rectified thing, a little bit of

26
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,580
shaking is going on here because this was done all automatically.

27
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,780
And by the way, this is like one of the few results I'll show you

28
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,800
that was actually done by a student of mine.

29
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,410
When we were doing that interpreting American football plays, and

30
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,620
this way just a pre processing step.

31
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,840
But the, we're able to recover the projection.

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,060
So if you need to save money on a blimp, this is what you do so

33
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,330
you can see an overhead view.

34
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,050
In fact in some sense this is easier because you see the side of the players,

35
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,900
not just their overhead.

36
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,330
So I probably should have patented this and

37
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,820
made a billion dollars and then I well, didn't happen.
