00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,870
Now for an exercise.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,910
No more programming Turing machines.

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,720
Instead I want you to try to figure out
how long the simulation process takes.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,340
We'll let m be a multitape
Turing machine, and

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,220
we'll let s be its single tape
equivalent, as we've defined it.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,910
If on input x m holds after t steps,
and we can assume t is greater than

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,210
the size of the input, then the single
tape machine halts after how many steps?

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,910
Give the most appropriate bound.

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,159
This question isn't easy, so spend
a few minutes thinking about it and

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:32,780
take a guess.
