1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,700
Let's now try to bring back some of the details on how images are captured from

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,870
these cameras, and try to get into some representations of how mathematically we

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,260
can look at all of these.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,340
Here we basically start off with an image that we want to capture, and

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,120
this is my sensor.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,680
As we looked on the image processing and image representations, most of

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,410
the time we represent an image in this form with x and y, or columns and rows.

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,460
Of course the 3D world has this coordinate axis, Y up X, and Z which could be

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,420
sometimes, in this case, be respective as we go down into the scene.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,700
So imagine if this is my object in the scene,

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,470
what would it actually look like in a 3D camera?

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,970
So to help us kind of get into understanding this kind of concept of

13
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:47,100
a camera model, let's imagine I have an object in this 3D scene.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,660
To help us, we will actually unwrap this.

15
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,910
And now I'm showing the Z-axis, and this way X and Y, so

16
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,770
I've kind of turned it around and looking at this scene from this direction, and

17
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,890
that, that basically is the way I'm looking at it here.

18
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,910
So this is my object, and again shown here.

19
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,060
Basically, I'm just going to give it some value, X, Y, and

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,970
Z, which basically is this point here of this object.

21
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,950
We can basically look at all the values, so X is this,

22
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:18,040
Z is this, sorry Z is, Z would be this value.

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,470
X is this value and Y would be up how high this object is.

24
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,520
Of course the tracing the ray through and imagine this to be a pinhole, so

25
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,968
this is my pinhole of the camera itself.

26
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:30,320
Ray goes through here.

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,670
And of course on the other side,

28
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,290
I should be able to now think about where the image will be formed.

29
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,380
We'll get an inverted image on that side there,

30
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,510
and of course it's on that side of the X axis.

31
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,790
And this would be the value in the image plane on the sensor.

32
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,970
And it's my sensor, this is where the image forms on that side of the camera.

33
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,220
So the camera pinhole is here, the sensor is here, 3D scene is here.

34
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,370
We know that, of course, the sensor should be at the focal plain.

35
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,610
Now using similar triangles we can actually start finding out

36
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,760
more information about where the values of this would be.

37
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,150
The similar triangle basically says that the ratio of xi over f,

38
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:14,390
which is xi over f, should be the same as X-non which is this value here.

39
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:19,140
So xi is this and focal length of course is this.

40
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:27,940
Similarly, X0 is this and in place of f we have the Z value here.

41
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,850
So xi over f is equal to X-non over Z-non.

42
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:36,470
And similarly for y, we can do the same thing and come up with this equation.

43
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,410
We can simplify this to now be able to get the values of xi and

44
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,900
yi with this relationship.

45
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,050
So as long as I know,

46
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,780
of course, the, how far the object is from the scene and where it is, I should

47
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,280
be able to now figure out where the pixel value would be on that image itself.

48
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,670
Of course, we not, not all the time do we know these values from the real word,

49
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,850
especially just from an image.
