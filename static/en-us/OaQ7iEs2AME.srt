1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,360
Android makes it easy to incorporate
translation into your app.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,980
Here I've made a translate app, and
I'm going to make it display text

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,800
that translates automatically
to our language of interest.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,250
In this case, we'll include
translations to Spanish and French.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,740
So I've started with the main
activity with an empty view.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,530
So the first thing we need to
do is to create some text,

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,250
by creating a text view.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,030
And we can do that in our
activity main XML file.

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,150
Right now, we just have our empty
layout, so let's create a text view

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,160
that appears at the top of our screen
and displays the text hello world.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,940
Our text view automatically gives us
our layout width and layout height.

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,400
And since I want to text to
appear at the top of our screen,

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,400
I'm going to give these dimensions
that take up the whole screen,

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,110
which is going to be wrapped content for
both.

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,980
Great, now I need one more parameter.

16
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,940
That's the text that this will contain.

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,690
So, I say android text equals.

18
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,880
Now I can put any string
I want to be displayed.

19
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,560
And I'll put Hello_World.

20
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
Now let's see if this worked.

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,240
It did, we see it appear right
at the top of our screen and

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,210
actually let me change the text size so
that it's bigger.

23
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,519
Okay, I change of text size to be 24 dp,
so that should be bigger.

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,390
Great, now it's a little more
visible and we can change this text

25
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,690
to anything we want just by changing
the wording in our text view.

26
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,730
So instead of Hello World,
I could say goodbye,

27
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,290
and then save it and it'll change.

28
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,230
But to display this in different
languages, we want to be

29
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,980
able to load this string from a file and
change it based on the language we want.

30
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,210
So we don't actually want to hard
code it in our view like we've done.

31
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,065
Instead, for any text we use,

32
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:36,478
we'll want to reference it from our
file that contains all our strings or

33
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,780
strings XML file, or strings that
are contained in our values folder.

34
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,750
So let's take a look at what's in there.

35
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,860
We already have a string called
app name that says translate,

36
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,320
that's the title of our app and
one for settings as well.

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,070
These were automatically generated.

38
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,580
So now let's make our own.

39
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,620
So in our strings XML file,

40
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,200
let's create a string with
the variable name, hello world.

41
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,020
Then this string tag will include
the word or phrase we want to display.

42
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,300
So let's just write in hello_world here.

43
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,258
Then we'll want to reference this
variable when we go to display our

44
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:11,360
text view.

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,740
And to reference it, we'll be using
the variable name hello_world.

46
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,188
So let's go back to our text view.

47
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:21,870
In antibody main,and delete
our hard coded text.

48
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,602
To reference a string variable in
strings to XML, we have to say @string.

49
00:02:28,602 --> 00:02:30,870
And you'll see some pop up,

50
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,100
all the strings that are stored
In our string's XML file.

51
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,280
So we want to say @string then
slash the variable name we want,

52
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,880
which in this case is
our hello world string.

53
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,716
Now let's save this and
see what's displayed.

54
00:02:42,716 --> 00:02:46,025
Hello world, It worked.

55
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:49,485
And loading the string instead of
writing it indirectly makes it easy for

56
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:51,595
us to include different languages.

57
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:52,385
For example,

58
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:56,185
to include the string in Spanish, you
just have to open a translation editor.

59
00:02:57,435 --> 00:03:01,820
Up here we click on the little
world icon, and edit translations.

60
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,470
We see all our string variables,
action settings, app name, and

61
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,790
hello world which I'm going to focus on.

62
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,560
So to add a Spanish
translation to hello world,

63
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,860
I just click on this world icon again.

64
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,140
And you can see all of these options for
different languages.

65
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,670
So I'll scroll all
the way down to Spanish.

66
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,870
And when I click it, these boxes
appear under a Spanish option.

67
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,160
Our app name will stay
the same unless we change it.

68
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,970
And we have to include translations for
Settings, and

69
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,330
hello world, and
any other strings we added.

70
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,649
So let's include a Spanish
translation for hello world.

71
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:39,390
We go down here to the translation
box and type in our translation.

72
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,170
Instead of hello world,
we'll have hola mundo.

73
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,630
And let's add one more
type of translation.

74
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,640
Let's add a French one.

75
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,850
So again we go to a world icon and
scroll down to French.

76
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,470
And we have another column appearing for
the French language.

77
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,940
And I'll write my translation.

78
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,410
Instead of hello world,
I'll have bonjour tu la monde.

79
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,020
And so, all these different translations

80
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,670
are now assigned to a same
string variable, hello_world.

81
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,820
Then, for any devices that are in
Spanish or French our app will check in

82
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,060
here for any Spanish resources or
French resources.

83
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,040
And if it can't find any,
it will go back to a default value.

84
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,029
And it's the same process for
any other languages you want to add.

85
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,970
So localization can
be as simple as that.
