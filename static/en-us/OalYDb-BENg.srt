1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,020
Okay, so photometric stereo is used in a couple of interesting applications.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,230
It does have some challenges, like you have to know the reflectance function.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,190
You have to know that reflectance map.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,420
So typically, it's assumed for

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,730
Lambertian types of stuff, maybe a little bit of specularity.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,080
But, but basically you have to understand the reflectance function.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,865
It also has a problem with shadows or

8
00:00:20,865 --> 00:00:24,860
interreflections, because it's assuming that the only thing that matters.

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,120
Was the orientation of the surface with respect to the light.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,740
There's some smaller problems like the cameras and

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,810
light sources have to be far enough away that, that it's a constant angle.

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,090
That's not so bad.

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,780
Calibration is important, right?

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,790
Remember we're assuming that everything is linear in terms of the intensity,

15
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,190
with respect to the light that's hitting the camera.

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,280
So you need a lot of photometric calibration.

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,810
Before I conclude a couple of things about some shape from shading.

18
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,370
One is, there was a really cool use of it.

19
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,810
There was a paper, it actually won one of the Marr prizes in 1995 in ICCV, and

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,580
it was this idea, that namely shape from shading with Interreflection Under

21
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,860
a Proximal Light Source, Distortion Free Copying of an Unfolded Book.

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,710
And it appeared later in IJCV,

23
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,030
International Journal of Computer Vision, and what they were looking at.

24
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,150
Was this idea that, you know, when you put a book down on a scanner, or

25
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,580
a copier, you get this surface that bends away.

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,550
And you can recover something about that surface structure.

27
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,650
And you should also be able to sort of unshade what happens,

28
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,610
because the light falls off.

29
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,920
Now unfortunately, the images that are in the original picture

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,360
don't reproduce very well.

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,220
So you're going to see something that looks really ugly here.

32
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,310
Obviously it wasn't pure black in here, but it was just very darkened.

33
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,540
And they were able to recover the white and

34
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,380
the text, by essentially undoing the shape from shading.

35
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,770
And I thought that was pretty cool.

36
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,650
Shape from shading also, in the human world of course is much more complicated.

37
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,030
A whole bunch of interesting effects.

38
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,129
One that's well known is this light source direction effect.

39
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,210
So if you see here on the right, you probably see, especially if you're

40
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,270
looking at this sort of vertically, you probably see a sphere lit from up here.

41
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,310
What most people see, if you show them just this thing on the right,

42
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,980
is a dimple, something pushed in, okay?

43
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,130
With, again, the light source coming down.

44
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,450
Now of course.

45
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,150
Figure b, is just figure a rotated around.

46
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,430
So, in one you see something bent out towards you.

47
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,360
On the other you see something pushed in.

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,690
But, the reality is they've just been rotated around.

49
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,970
There seems to be a human preference for

50
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,650
light sources to be up above, instead of down below.

51
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,120
And there's a whole bunch of other work on sort of human effect.

52
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,490
There is another demonstration of human shape from shading.

53
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:55,920
Which is a multi, multi, multibillion dollar industry, and that's called makeup.

54
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,750
So as, and,

55
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,240
and there's no way this without being gender specific, so I will say it.

56
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,710
As many women know, properly applied foundation, can cause

57
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:11,660
the shape of your cheekbones and other parts of your face and other elements.

58
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:17,270
To be perceived as having either a higher shape, or a more rounded.

59
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:22,580
And what you're doing is you're changing the shading just a little bit, so

60
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,380
that the human vision system ascribes a slightly different shape.

61
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,300
To the underlying contour.

62
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,630
And so it's taking advantage of shape from shading.

63
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,560
And you know, good makeup artists know exactly how that works and

64
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,600
that's a, that's a interesting shading phenomenon.
