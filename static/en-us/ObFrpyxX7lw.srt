00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:02,310
For linear regression, we compute

2
00:00:02,642 --> 00:00:04,072
the quotation B and A,

3
00:00:04,329 --> 00:00:05,543
and I give you the formulas

4
00:00:06,186 --> 00:00:08,074
B is calculated as a quotient

5
00:00:08,227 --> 00:00:10,421
of these terms that I’ve given you before

6
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:13,367
divided by those guys here.

7
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:14,653
A as you might remember

8
00:00:14,964 --> 00:00:16,180
is given by this formula.

9
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:18,188
And to compute them, let’s first compute

10
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:19,677
the various components here.

11
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:23,000
Let’s start with N, what is N?
