00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:07,470
Let's now talk about DNS security. To understand the threats and vulnerabilities

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:14,970
of DNS, let's take a look at the DNS architecture. So we have a stub resolver

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,690
which issues a query to a caching resolver. At this point, we could have

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:26,090
a man in the middle attack, or an attacker which observes a query and forges

5
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:32,009
a response. If a query goes further than the local caching resolver, say

6
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,650
for example, to an authoritative name server, an attacker could try to send a

7
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:44,440
reply back to that caching resolver before the real reply comes back to try to

8
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:51,310
poison, or corrupt, the cache with bogus DNS records for a particular name.

9
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,390
This attack is particularly virulent and we will

10
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,960
look at a cache poisoning attack in this

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,890
lecture. Masters and slaves can both be spoofed.

12
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,340
Zone files could be corrupted. Updates to the

13
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,130
dynamic update system could also be spoofed. We

14
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,430
will look at some defenses to cache poisoning,

15
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,400
including the OX20 defense, as well as DNSSEC,

16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,890
which can protect against some of these spoofing and

17
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,830
man in the middle attacks. In addition to

18
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,710
these attacks, we'll look at an attack called

19
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,220
DNS reflection where the DNS can be used

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,500
to mount a large distributed denial of service attack.
