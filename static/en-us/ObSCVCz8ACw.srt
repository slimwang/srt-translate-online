1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:05,299
And the answer here is, although it might be a bit surprising, it's actually that we can't be sure yet.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:11,399
You might be inclined to think that the answer is yes because the reduction from vertex cover to independent set was very simple.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,666
The thing is this reduction, simple as it may be, could still be destroying the approximation factor,

4
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:19,433
and this is what we'll have a close look at now.
