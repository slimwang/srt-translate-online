1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
How much difference does the coefficient of friction make?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's compute what's going to happen if we brake with a very high friction 1.0,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which is really optimistic, and with a slightly less friction.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Our car should be traveling at 120 km/h, which is approximately 75 miles/h.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How long will it take to come to a complete stop? Enter the numbers of seconds with 1 decimal place.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Here's a hint--think about this diagram, how does the velocity of the car depend on time

7
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and think about Newton law from Unit 1.
