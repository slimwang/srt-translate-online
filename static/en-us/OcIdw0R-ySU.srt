00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,880
The answer is android.permission.INTERNET. I'll show you now,

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,380
where it's located in the code. Under the

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,180
main folder open up the Android manifest.xml file.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,660
Within the Android manifest file, we declare uses

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,800
permission, with the name of the permission. We

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,880
verified that the data returned is correct by

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,810
adding a verbose log statement for printing out

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,300
the forecastJsonStr. This is in the fetch weather task.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,830
We can verify that it's going to show up in the logs. For this example, I'm

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,890
going to use the command line. These are the real time logs, and then if I

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:39,120
hit refresh, then I see the weather data here. The verbose log, and this is our

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,040
log tag fetch weather task. Here's the forecastJsonStr,

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,070
and this is all the output from the server.
