1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And because there's only 1 invariance left,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
let me talk about View Point Invariance

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
as the final invariance.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So the appearance of this object depends on

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
from what direction you look, what your view point is.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And you can see it's very different, from different view points.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So this looks fundamentally different from this,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
from this.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's called View Point or Vantage Point Invariance,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and it's one of the hardest invariances

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
because the appearance of the object

12
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
might really alter a lot, from different vantage points.
