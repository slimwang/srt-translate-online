1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,899
The first step is called a probabilistic, context-free grammar, or PCFG.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,666
And what that means is we take this context-free grammar--this is the same one we had before;

3
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:21,832
I just rewrote it on multiple lines, so each alternative separated by the "or" bar is on a separate line by itself.

4
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:30,266
And now we're just going to associate a probability with each of the right-hand sides for each of the left-hand side symbols.

5
00:00:30,267 --> 00:00:36,999
So for a sentence, there's only one way to rewrite a sentence, so that gets probability one.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,466
And for a noun phrase, there are four ways, and we have to divvy up our probability one among them.

7
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:56,999
So let's say we do .3, .4, .2, .1. That's saying that it's going to be rare to have this three-noun compound,

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,566
and fairly common to have a determiner followed by a noun, like "the dog."

9
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:17,566
Now, for a verb phrase maybe we'll have .4, .4, .2. And we can fill in numbers for each of these categories as well,

10
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:24,599
to distinguish between the common and the uncommon words, used as each of the categories.

11
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,999
And we'll go ahead and fill those in. So now what we have is a grammar that specifies all the allowable trees.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,132
So a tree is made up of a conjunction of these rules. We start off with a sentence and we generate a noun phrase and a verb phrase,

13
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:45,566
and then for the noun phrase we generate one of these choices, and so on.

14
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:53,599
And a probability associated with each of those choices. And the probability of the sentence as a whole

15
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,866
to be associated with the tree that we've chosen is just a product of all the individual probabilities.

16
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:10,899
So for example, we can take the sentence, "Fed raises interest rates" and associate a tree with that,

17
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,732
and calculate the probability of the tree. We don't have space here, so let's put it on its own page.

18
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:23,966
So now we have our sentence, we have our first tree, and we have our probabilistic context-free grammar,

19
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:29,232
and now we can figure out the probability of this parse tree. The way we do that is

20
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:32,666
for each of the nodes in the tree, we just look up the probability.

21
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:42,399
So what's the probability of N becoming "Fed"? That's N is Fed, is .3. So we'll write that down here.

22
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:54,999
V becoming "raises" is .6. N being interest is .3. As is N being rates. Now, nP becoming an N, that's here,

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:05,566
that's also .3. NP becoming two nouns, that's .2. A VP being a verb followed by a noun phrase is .4.

24
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:11,732
And a sentence being a noun phrase followed by a verb phrase, in our grammar that's probability one.

25
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:27,100
We multiply these all out, and we get .0003888, or .039%, approximately.
