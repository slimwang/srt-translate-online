1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,310
Once you know where you intend to
distribute your app, you can design for

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,520
localization.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,510
Planning early is key as you need to
consider the space and locations for

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,790
each language.

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,490
You can reuse your default layout
if you build a flexible UI.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,840
The key to this is to allow elements
to expand horizontally and vertically.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,850
And also to leave about 30%
more space than you need for

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,470
your default language, so the
translations will have plenty of room.

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,010
If you need an alternative layout,
though, you can tag it with the relevant

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,450
qualifiers so that the resource
framer can find it automatically.

11
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,770
But, using the mini alternative
layouts will be harder to maintain.

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,890
So you'll need to determine
what's best for your app.
