00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, here's my answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What I do is I make a variable called markers,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which is going to be a bunch of strings of the format of 'markers = %s, %s',

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
substituting in the lat and long for p and points.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Then we're going to join those together with an ampersand,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and then we're just going to append that to the base URL. Simple enough.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay, if I were to run this with just a single point, it still needs to be in a list.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Our function is still expecting a list but one point.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Make up some fake coordinates here and give this a run.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We see that this also works just fine-- "markers=100,200',

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and there's this one markers parameter.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,039
Let's go ahead and use this in our program.
