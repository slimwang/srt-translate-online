1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,433
Nothing like a year free of [INAUDIBLE] and all the things you

2
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:07,508
might have done this [INAUDIBLE] like the combination of technologies.

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:12,912
Like I mean in the [INAUDIBLE] you maybe wanted to look at [INAUDIBLE] and

4
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,674
real time and sudden fashion, right?

5
00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:19,802
If you think you are going to focus on more on the batch [INAUDIBLE].

6
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:24,198
I will not produce then hive, then probably scalding and

7
00:00:24,198 --> 00:00:28,380
cascading all these various tools, that they need to understand and

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,830
how those tools work, in general all right.

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,760
And if you run the real time aspect of the things,

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,030
then you might want to understand more on the as well as the technologies,

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,010
like storm and And some of the abstractions,

12
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,810
like something brought the maps into the storm to Paulise, right?

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,822
These technologies are very important to know how you can extract data, and

14
00:00:50,822 --> 00:00:54,466
how can do starts, doing some simple analytics on top of it, right?

15
00:00:54,466 --> 00:01:00,308
And your peer, your pull and analytic person then not only.

16
00:01:00,308 --> 00:01:05,163
Understanding these components help you better understand how to write analytic

17
00:01:05,163 --> 00:01:09,680
and also you will know how to tune it to get the results that faster, as well.

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,460
And the analytic of the extra burden of knowing some of the statistics, and

19
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,421
the data-mining algorithms, and all the various, like being in a Christian

20
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:21,458
clustering and all the various other outcomes, but they need to know about it.

21
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:21,958
>> Mm-hm. >> Yeah.
