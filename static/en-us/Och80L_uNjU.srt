00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:07,882
Our model is the log of price equals 0.415 plus 9.144

2
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:14,970
times the cube root of carat, minus 1.093 times carat plus a series

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,490
of coefficient times each factor in cut another series of coefficient times

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,723
each factor in color. And another series of coefficients times each factor

5
00:00:25,723 --> 00:00:29,060
in clarity plus an error term. What could

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,500
be some problems when using this model. What

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,910
else should we think about when we're using

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,180
it. Go ahead and enter your answer here.
