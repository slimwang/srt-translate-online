1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,660
So let's go over this for a bark ment.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,050
One of our features that our
competitors don't have is on call vets.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,770
And we also have insurance for
the animal and the sitter's home.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,180
Now for price,

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,430
we actually have a little bit of
a lower price than our main competitor.

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,830
But we have added value that we
just talked about in the product.

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,110
Now for promotions,
I don't want to give too much away, but

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,090
we have the Pal + Paws Walk.

9
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,230
This is where our sitters and
our owners get to meet each other and

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,860
do a 3K for
charity to save shelter animals.

11
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,710
For place, we're only going to
accept nice homes and yards.

12
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,330
We're going to vet the environment
the sitters have for each dog.

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,420
We'll talk more about
this part in a few.

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,180
And for

15
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,530
people, well we have Ronnie and me,
we're both passionate about what we do.

16
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,750
And we're going to go above and

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,830
beyond to make sure this
company gets off the ground.
