00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Our first guest is Peter Winkler who is a world expert in discrete mathematics and combinatorics

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and a mathematics and computer science professor at Dartmouth College.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
His work has had substantial impact on the design of algorithms

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and theoretical computer science.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He is also a celebrated collector of mathematical puzzles,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
having written two books on the subject as well as a monthly column

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
for the communications of the ACM.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now, since I've started off every unit with a mathematical magic trick,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I thought Peter would be an excellent person to beguile us

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
with a few fascinating tricks of his own.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
[Peter Winkler, Professor, Dartmouth College] I have a puzzle from my book about a spy

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
who is trying to convey information to her control,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but the only means she has for conveying information

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
is that there is a 15-bit radio broadcast every morning,

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and she has the ability if she wishes to alter 1 bit of that broadcast.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But she doesn't know in advance what the broadcast will be.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So, this is a case where, potentially, there are 16 different things she can do.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There are 15 bits she can alter, or she can choose not to alter any bit,

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
which means that in theory perhaps she could convey as many as 4 bits

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
of information this way.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Well, surprisingly, she can actually do that.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
All right. Let's make sure that we understand the setup here.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm going to do this as a magic trick.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So, I'm a spy, and I'm in enemy territory, and I've got a message--0110--

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
that I need to transmit to my boss.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Now, that's going to be tricky to do, because I don't want anybody to know

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
that I'm a spy in enemy territory.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Fortunately, there is a radio broadcast tower in enemy territory,

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and everyday it sends out a 15-bit message.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
There's an example of a 15-bit message.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Now, I can use that message to communicate with my boss,

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
but I can't just change it arbitrarily to something completely different,

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
because then people will know that something weird has happened.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But I can flip just 1 bit.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I can zap the message and change just one of the bits,

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and my boss then is going to hear that,

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and we'd like him to actually interpret that as the message that I want to send.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's see if it worked.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hmm...based on the 15-bit broadcast I'm hearing,

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and the protocol that my spy and I arranged in advance,

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I know that the message he is sending to me is 0110. Nice work, agent P.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Ta-da!

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Here's what you can do, and the solution involves nimbers,

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
which come up in other problems as well.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
A nimber is just a binary number.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What makes it different from an ordinary number is that when you add two of them,

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
you add without carry.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So, they're added like vectors in a vector space over zÂ˛.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
They were called nimbers by John Conway,

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
because, as you may know, they are useful in analyzing a game of Nim.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So, what we can do is we take these 15 bits

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and we number them from 1-15,

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
but instead of thinking of those numbers as ordinary decimal numbers,

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
we think of them as nimbers.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Each position has a non-zero nimber starting with 001 for the first position

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and ending with 1111 for the fifteenth position.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What the spy wants to do is to convey some nimber of her choice to her control.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
For example, suppose to wants to convey the nimber 1100 to her control.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What she's going to do is she's going to simply tell her control,

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
"Look at this radio broadcast after I've altered it,

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and add up the nimbers of all the positions of where you see a 1."

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Now, when the spy sees the radio broadcast,

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
she looks at what the nimbers currently add up to.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Say the nimbers currently add up to 1010.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Then if she changed the 1010 bit, they would add up to 0000,

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
so that's what she would do if she wanted to convey 0000.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
She wants to convey 1100 so she adds that to 1010.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That gives her a nimber. She changes the value of the bit at that nimber.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It works. Marvelous.
