1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Consider the case where a number can be either 0 or 1 with 0.5 probability for each.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What is its variance?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Note that this is the same as figuring out the variance of 2 data points,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
1 that's 0 and 1 that's 1.
