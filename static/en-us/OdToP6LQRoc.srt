00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
For the final quiz for this unit, your goal is to change the look up procedure

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,370
to now work with dictionaries.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,780
Before we had look up working where index was a list of entries,

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,080
and we did the look up by looping through the index, that required a lot of work

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,050
we had to go through each entry, check if the keyword matched,

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,050
and then return the one that matched, if we got to the end without finding it,

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,690
we returned none.

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,890
Your goal for the quiz, is to modify this code

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,860
to now work where the index is going to be the dictionary,

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,230
and we should be able to find the entry much more quickly.

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,430
We don't need to loop through anything.

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,200
we can use the property of the dictionary to look up the entry right away.

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,870
If you understand the add to index code that we just did,

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,180
I think you can define look up on your own.

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,980
The one thing to be careful about,

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,950
is that you need make sure that when the index does not contain the keyword,

17
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,520
when it's not in the dictionary,

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,520
instead of producing an error, that it returns the value none.
