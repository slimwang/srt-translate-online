1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,390
Let's go through the prediction and

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:04,400
correction just a little
bit in the Kalman 1D case.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,870
Remember, we're going to assume
that the state of time t, okay,

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,660
is just a constant times whatever
the state was at t minus 1,

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,830
plus some noise that's added,
some process noise.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:18,470
Right?

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,570
So the first thing we would like to do
is we would like to know our estimate.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,650
What's our best guess?

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:29,090
At time t, given everything t minus 1,
when we've got this Gaussian model.

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,846
Well, we're going to write
this the following, right.

11
00:00:31,846 --> 00:00:33,870
If, if something is a Gaussian, and

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,410
I multiply it by a constant,
what does that become?

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,890
It becomes another Gaussian.

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,120
Or another way of saying it,
I have some variable that's distributed

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,660
by a Gaussian, and
I multiply that variable by a constant.

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,110
I get a new value out.

17
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,740
But it's also a Gaussian, all right?

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,950
And in fact,
if you remember from probability right?

19
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,350
It's mean is just going to be that
constant times the previous mean.

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,760
So that's what this equation here says.

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,890
This equation says that if I have my
belief about the mean at time t minus 1.

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,730
After I've done all
my work at t minus 1.

23
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:14,370
And if I believe that my
dynamics are multiplying

24
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,500
the state at every time step by d,
my belief before

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,750
I take a measurement about what the new
mean is just going to be d times that.

26
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,520
That's what this equation at
the bottom says here, right?

27
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,560
Mu minus a time t,

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:36,180
the predicted mean is just d times
the mean from what I had before.

29
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,120
Okay?
Because d is my multiplier.

30
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,570
All right, so you remember that when I
multiply something by a constant and

31
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,810
it's Gaussian, the mean just multiplies.

32
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,320
But what about the variance, okay?

33
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,020
Now we have to update the variance.

34
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,100
There are two things that are going on.

35
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,000
First of all,
we're taking some previous variable and

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,880
we're multiplying it by constant.

37
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,820
That variable had some sigma,
sigma squared to it.

38
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,590
And maybe you remember if you have
a Gaussian, when you multiply that by

39
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,800
a constant, its variance goes up
by the square of that constant.

40
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,690
So just In the multiplication part,
all right.

41
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,780
Whatever the variance was before is
going to go up by now d squared.

42
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,930
But wait, we're not done.

43
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:28,680
We also added in some more noise when
we took that step, right, of d squared.

44
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,630
So that means the new variance
before we take a measurement

45
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,190
is made up of two components.

46
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,376
It's d squared times whatever
the variance was before so

47
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:39,350
that's written as d sigma
t minus 1 plus squared.

48
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:45,960
Sigma t minus 1 plus is the standard
deviation if its squared.

49
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,240
It's the variance of what we
had at the end of t minus 1.

50
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,870
We multiply everything by d.

51
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,540
So we multiply that
variance by d squared.

52
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,410
That's what this term over here is.

53
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,800
And then, we added in some more noise.

54
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,190
Because of uncertainty of how
the thing actually then moved,

55
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,920
that is this d squared okay?

56
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,858
So even if we were multiplying by
a one that is even if we had no idea.

57
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:12,190
There was that, you know,
everything was just a one,

58
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,680
our variance would still grow
because of the added uncertainty.

59
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,206
All right?
So the, the update of the mean or

60
00:03:18,206 --> 00:03:21,198
the update of the variance for
the Kalman is written like this.

61
00:03:21,198 --> 00:03:22,483
All right.
