1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,220
There are many advances that can
be considered the beginning of

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,070
virtual reality.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:09,170
You could look at the origins
of computer graphics or

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,495
maybe start with the philosophical
concept of alternate realities.

5
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:17,785
You could draw a line from the many
advancements in film an animation.

6
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:21,055
Or you could say it all started
with the invention of the computer.

7
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:27,295
And I think those are all
valid places to begin, but for

8
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:33,115
me, the history of VR begins
with 3D display technology.

9
00:00:33,115 --> 00:00:37,875
That's the first line of invention that
leads directly to what we call VR today.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,402
In the beginning of 3D
display technology,

11
00:00:42,402 --> 00:00:46,709
really starts on earnest with
the stereoscope in 1838.

12
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:50,761
This device was created by
a brilliant English inventor

13
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:54,910
names Sir Charles Wheatstone,
and it worked like this.

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,260
One picture is shown to the left eye,
and

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,690
another picture is shown to the right.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,099
The two pictures are of the same object.

17
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,570
One from the viewpoint of the left eye,

18
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,369
and the other from
the viewpoint of the right.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,850
There are a pair of mirrors at 45
degree angles to the user's eyes and

20
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,100
each is reflecting
a picture off to the side.

21
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,960
When the two views of the same
object are shown to their

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,710
respective eye in the same location

23
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:28,110
they fuse to form a view of
a solid three dimensional object.

24
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,080
It's a pretty amazing invention right?

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,180
After the stereoscope, there were
a number of improvements on 3D displays.

26
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,940
And folks experimented with
various kinds of immersive

27
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,830
entertainment machines.

28
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,910
But if we skip past all of those,

29
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,989
the next biggest VR advancement was
undoubtedly the Sword of Damocles.

30
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,849
Many folks consider it the first VR and
AR device and

31
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:57,811
it was invented by
Ivan Sutherland at MIT in 1968.

32
00:01:57,811 --> 00:02:02,646
The Sword of Damocles was the first
device to track a users head motion and

33
00:02:02,646 --> 00:02:07,089
overlay synthetic 3D stereoscopic
computer generated graphics

34
00:02:07,089 --> 00:02:08,448
into their vision.

35
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:12,342
The device had a long mechanical arm
that extended from the ceiling and

36
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:14,610
attached to the user's head.

37
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,500
And the user was shown primitive,

38
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,280
wireframe 3D objects projected
onto a transparent display.

39
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,300
In this way,

40
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,990
the Sword of Damocles was the first
augmented reality display as well.

41
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:32,010
Ivan Sutherland accomplished a great
deal in the field of computer graphics.

42
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,570
And make no mistake, he deeply
understood the potential of VR.

43
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,490
His pioneering work brought us a lot
closer to the virtual reality technology

44
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,080
we have today.

45
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,260
later, in the early 1990s,

46
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,260
we saw virtual reality first
promoted to the general public.

47
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,990
Thanks to advancements made by, NASA and

48
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:57,390
VPL, consumer virtual reality
seemed like it was a possibility.

49
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,340
Movies were released that used
virtual reality as a plot device.

50
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,460
Successful books were written
that depicted virtual reality

51
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,860
as a completely realistic
alternate universe.

52
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,490
But the virtual reality devices
that actually sold didn't

53
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,130
live up to those unrealistically
high expectations.

54
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,280
Nintendo's virtual play
had set was a red and

55
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,219
black, low quality display
that often cause headaches.

56
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,360
Headsets with tracking were
extremely expensive and bulky, and

57
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,330
the displays were poor.

58
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,300
Input systems like data gloves
left a lot to be desired.

59
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,530
In short, virtual reality simply
wasn't ready for the general public.

60
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,480
And after a while, the hype died away,
the industry shrank and

61
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,220
VR was relegated to academic and
military use.

62
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,410
That is until 2012.

63
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,220
When a kick starter was announced for

64
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,530
a new inexpensive VR device
called the Oculus Rift.

65
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,510
The booming mobile phone industry
had driven down the price of

66
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,860
high quality display technology.

67
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,570
And Oculus leveraged this fact and used
a clever single paneled display system

68
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,640
to manufacture an inexpensive,
high quality VR headset.

69
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,778
Shortly thereafter,
Occulus was acquired by Facebook for

70
00:04:08,778 --> 00:04:14,145
$2 billion and we've seen the VR
industry take off like a rocket.

71
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:17,420
We're now experiencing
the second wave of consumer VR,

72
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,550
and this time it's here for good.

73
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,370
It exciting to see how far thing have
come,and we are just getting started.
