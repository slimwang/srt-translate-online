1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,450
But what if you want to actually know
what's going on inside human brains?

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,720
And presuming, presuming these
are people you actually like.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,010
So how would you measure what's
going on in their brain?

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,680
Well, you're not going to stick
electrodes in their brain.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,580
What you're going to do
is something called fMRI.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,680
Okay, or
a functional magnetic resonance imaging.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,360
So many of you probably have had an MRI,
or

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,700
an MRI uses strong magnetic fields to
sort of mess around with electrons in

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,580
order to be able to get
differential density measurements.

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,040
Well, you can do something cool also.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,890
You can use a dye contrast that
the magnetic fields perturb

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,040
differently depending upon how much
oxygen is in that part of the the blood.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,940
So, just like we did before with that
experiment with the monkeys where you

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,090
injected, sort of, that radioactive
isotope connect the oxygen.

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,580
Now what we can do is we can have you
have die contrast, go into an fMRI,

16
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,320
have you look at things, and see what
parts of your brain are lighting up.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,020
All right?

18
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,000
So here's an example, sort of
notionally of an fMRI activation, so

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,370
this is of course obviously a
reconstruction based on the density, and

20
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,110
here you can see the activity
that's being done.

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,290
This is a three dimensional
reconstruction.

22
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,440
This is what a slice would
actually look like, right?

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,910
This is a single activation slice.

24
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,830
And these colors are different levels
of activation compared against a,

25
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,800
a background activation.

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,490
So one of the areas that people were
studying a lot, and arguing about was,

27
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,480
was there a part of the brain that
seemed very responsive to faces, okay?

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,970
And it's called the fusiform face area,
and

29
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,940
it's a little bit controversial
as to whether, or

30
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,150
not something really responds to just
faces, or other sorts of patterns.

31
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,190
This is a paper recently 2004, actually
Nancy Kanwisher, last author there,

32
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:49,650
was a graduate student,
when I was, same department, and

33
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,660
she does great work on
understanding physiology.

34
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,260
And, and these, this paper's one of the,
well known papers, Grill-Spector et al.

35
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,130
And they're just focusing on this area,
this FAA, fusiform face area,

36
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,230
in terms of understanding
where faces light things up.

37
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:12,430
One of the reasons for looking at faces
is that there's been a long history of

38
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,140
sort of faces being special in,
in human vision.

39
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,030
So there's examples that very,
very early on in an infant's life

40
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,810
they have a preference, and they do
test called preferential looking,

41
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,840
if you put something up does
the infant tend to look this way, okay?

42
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,280
So the, the,
the experimenter holds something.

43
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,820
The experimenter doesn't know whether
it's a picture of actually a face,

44
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,730
something blank like this, or something
that has the face pieces on it.

45
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,020
All the experimenter does is he,
he or she holds something up, and

46
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,400
he just says, yep,
I think he looked this way.

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,440
Yep.

48
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,460
Nope.

49
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,930
And the question is do you
tend to get the looking more

50
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,720
when you actually put
up a picture of face?

51
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,010
And the answer is,
says here er, early minute,

52
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,026
very early in life there seems
to be a preference for faces.

53
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:59,226
Likewise there were responses
of various other things,

54
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:03,898
responding to, this is a cell recording,
that when shown faces, responds, and

55
00:03:03,898 --> 00:03:08,400
when shown these other things,
fruits, hands, et cetera, don't.

56
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,880
Likewise, there are measurements
using this fMRI

57
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,730
of areas that respond to faces.

58
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,920
And so, this is another paper,

59
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,990
another picture from that same
paper I showed you before.

60
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,340
And you'll see here that
they've got different

61
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,010
object types that they're showing,
and the idea is that different parts.

62
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,690
See, so you see this area here that
lights up really well with faces,

63
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,180
and doesn't here, here,
here, here, or there?

64
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,260
And the idea is that these
are other objects that,

65
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,540
sort of, took the same,
amount of location, and intensity, and

66
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,860
et cetera, but
only lit up when the faces were there.

67
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,560
So it was an example of understanding
a part of the brain doing a particular

68
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,150
process.
