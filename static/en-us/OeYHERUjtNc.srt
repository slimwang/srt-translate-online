00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] Let me first give you a brief quiz to understand how the projection works

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
in structure from motion.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Suppose we have 3 point features at the known location.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We have a camera over here, camera A,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which can see these 3 point features.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We have a second camera over here, camera B,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
a pinhole camera which can see the same features.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Suppose camera A on the left sees feature 1,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
at the center sees feature 3, and on the right side of the camera plane sees feature 2.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I would like to know for camera B what will be on the camera plane on the left side,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
the center, or the right side.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Which of the features 1, 2, 3 will be seen left, center, or right?
