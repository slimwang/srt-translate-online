1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's about time to get even one dimension more, heat conduction in 2D.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So, we're talking about temperature distribution that depends on time, on x and as a premiere on y.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
One way for visualizing this is a movie.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Each frame of the movie depicts the temperature distribution in x and y

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
at that precise instance of time, then we come to the next frame of the movie

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
which shows us the next distribution in x and y and so on and so on

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and what we expect to see is diffusion.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If there's only one hot spot at the beginning, it should gradually dilute over time.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The heat equation in 2 dimensions does not contain any surprise.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The partial derivative of the temperature with respect to time

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
equals α times the second derivative of the temperature with respect to x

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
plus the second derivative of temperature with respect to y.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Note aside, this expression is often called the Laplace operator applied to T.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Don't confuse this triangle with the delta. It's also often called the Laplacian.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You can imagine the Laplace operator to measure something like

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
the bend of a surface in 2 dimensions and there's a very simple

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
finite-difference scheme for that differential equation as well.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Now, we're looking at one point at the current time and the current values left and right,

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
below and above to compute the next value at that central position.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That next value is temperature after one time step at x and y and we can spell out our estimate.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is the value before times 0 x and y plus the time step

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
times the diffusivity divided by the spatial step size squared and now we got lots of terms

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The values of our function to the left, to the right, below, and above all at times 0

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:12,000
to the left (x - Δx0₁), to the right (x + Δx), below (y - Δx), and above (y + Δx).

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hopefully, it's not already confusing that I'm using Δx to also denote the increment of y.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Now that we've covered the outer point, the inner point remains.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
In one dimension, we are to subtract twice the value of the inner point.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
In two dimensions, we have to subtract four times its value.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's easy to see that this has to be a factor of 4. Imagine that it's equal to 100 Kelvin everywhere

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
then we get 100 + 100, (+), (+) makes 400.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We subtract 4 times 100 so we get 0. The new temperature will be old temperature as it has to be.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There's nothing that could be smooth out if the temperature is already constant in space.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This factor out 4 also hints at what's going to happen with instability.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We have to be even more picky about the step size.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It can only be half as large as in the one dimensional case.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And the other artifacts that we are going to see close to instability are checkered board patterns.
