1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,850
So the very last part of this lesson,

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,960
we'll do some simple analysis about what different filters we'll do, and

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,340
then we'll do more sophisticated filtering later.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,590
Here we have a picture, there's the original one on the left,

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,960
somebody's eye, maybe you know whose eye it is,

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,540
and I convolve it with that filter that's an impulse, what do you get back?

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,080
Well what do you get when you convolve an image with an impulse,

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,730
you get the original, and there it is, it's no change, 'kay so

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,370
when you filter with an impulse, all right.

10
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,090
So here's a slightly interesting one, what happens if I've got an impulse but

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,220
it's actually not centered at the reference point but

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,790
it's shifted over right, by one.

13
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,790
Well what's going to happen is, when I place my filter down the, in the middle,

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,620
it's going to go get the fill, the pixel from the right, and

15
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,060
put that down at the reference point, then I move it over,

16
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,180
and I get the right, now whether I get the one on the right or

17
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,530
the left will depend on whether I'm doing correlation or convolution,

18
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,170
remember correlation I just move it around, convolution I flip it over and

19
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,860
then move it around, but what you're going to end up with is a shifted image, so

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,540
in this case you'll shift to the left if you're doing correlation, so

21
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,740
by shifting the impulse you get a shifted function, and

22
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,536
that's because the idea is that the center coordinate here is 0,0.

23
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,470
All right, what about this?

24
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,464
So now I've got all ones divided by 9 so

25
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:17,530
it's so it sums to 1, what is that going to look like?

26
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,090
Well, we've already seen that, right, that's just a, kind of a crummy

27
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,720
smoothing filter, it's a blur, all right, so I just get out the blurred eye.

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,700
All right, now comes something really cool.

29
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,910
All right?

30
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:35,870
What if my filter, is actually the combination of these two?

31
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,160
Okay?

32
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,798
This is essentially twice the impulse, minus the blur.

33
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:44,379
All right.

34
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:52,040
Now, this is still all linear, so, the output of applying this kernel,

35
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,630
where the kernel is made up of sums and multiplies, can just be done by

36
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:02,710
taking the sums of the original two outputs, and that would look like this.

37
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,690
And you'll notice, I'll show you a better example in a minute,

38
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:10,880
that it's kind of sharpened up the image, it's accentuated the differences, and

39
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,720
this is, drawing something like this, so here, this is filter is called,

40
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,290
a sharpening filter, and it's got these little parts that have to do with the,

41
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,760
the minus, and then the part in the middle.

42
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,500
And if I show this applied to the whole filter, okay, you'll see that,

43
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,330
and you, so, now you know whose eye it is, there is Einstein's eye and

44
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,880
you'll, and if you take a look on your screen,

45
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,010
you'll see that this one is a good deal sharper than the, than the previous one.
