00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
I have another Gaussian question for you--

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,970
this is called a heavytail Gaussian.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,440
So, as you go to +/- infinity,

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,650
the Gaussian levels off at some finite value alpha,

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,550
as opposed to zero.

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,050
My question is--

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:23,890
"Is it possible to represent this function as a Gaussian?"

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,960
This is the formula for the Gaussian again.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,870
Particularly, can you find a Mu and a sigma square

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,000
for which this exact function over here is obtained?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please just check one of these two boxes.
