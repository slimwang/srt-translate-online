1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,220
In this scenario, in order to deal
with an increase in the order rates,

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,270
it would mean that we would
need to add more workers,

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,910
which is analogous to the processes,
or add more work benches,

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,780
analogous to the servers,
where those processes need to execute.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,300
Or add more tools and parts,
so analogous to the storage,

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,310
the state that's needed for
the execution of the service.

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,230
But we don't have to perform
any additional decisions

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,460
to decide what exactly are those
workers intended to do or

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,150
what specific tools or
parts do we need to add.

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,710
Just a little bit more of everything.

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,635
The bottom line is that,
in this scenario,

12
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:39,655
the management is fairly simple.

13
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:43,610
Still takes some time to do this but
we don't have to put a lot of thought

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,045
into exactly how we need to
configure these increased resources.
