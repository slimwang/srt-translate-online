00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,380
Congratulations, you just finished your first lesson. Following the lesson is

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,620
going to be a problem set, where you answer questions based on what you've

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,325
learned so far. Now, this is going to be the format for every lesson to come.

4
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:15,200
>> So if you're ready, go back to the problem set for lesson one and answer each

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,160
question. If you get stuck, go back to the lesson. Or, to the forum, where you

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,780
can then interact with your peers or with us.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,930
>> After you finish a problem set for lesson one, you're ready to move on to

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,430
lesson two. Where we're going to look at how psychologists conduct experiments

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,880
to learn more about human thought and behavior. Now it's important for the

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,560
remainder of the course that you notes while you're watching the lessons. In

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,840
addition, be sure to check the instructor's note section, which is here, to get

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,680
other valuable information that's contained in each lesson. And we'll see you

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,236
in lesson 2.
