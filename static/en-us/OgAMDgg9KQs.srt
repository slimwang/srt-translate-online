1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,050
The answer is 198.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,951
And in general, it's 2 times n- 2.

3
00:00:05,951 --> 00:00:09,950
We could go in the wrong order among
all the non-centered vertices.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,950
So it's possible that every
edge costs 2 except for

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,710
the ones leading in and
out of the center vertex.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,250
Of course, the optimum involves

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,660
just using the blue edges
which only have cost 1.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,280
So in this case,
the optimum has cost 100.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:30,390
By choosing n large enough, we therefore
can get this ratio of 2n- 2 over n,

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,850
as closest to 2 as we want.

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,660
So our analysis that this gives
a factor of 2 approximation is optimal.

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,150
The example just given
shows that our analysis

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,710
of that particular approximation
algorithm for metric TSP is tight.

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,790
There are some graphs at least
that really could return a tour

15
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,560
that has twice the cost
of the optimum 1.

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,760
So we can't improve on the theorem
just by better analysis.

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,710
It turns out that for
the metric traveling salesman problem,

18
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,120
there are algorithms out there
that give better approximations.

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,730
The most famous being
a 3 over 2 approximation

20
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,590
called the Christofides algorithm.

21
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,070
If you're familiar with matching
with general graphs, and

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,180
Eulerian tours, then understanding
it and the approximation guarantee

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,070
isn't too much more work than
what we've done already.

24
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,490
So I encourage you to
look it up on your own.

25
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,690
In addition,
there are many more results for

26
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,410
when various alternative assumptions
are made about the costive edges.

27
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,240
All of them giving different
approximation factors and

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,000
running time guarantees.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,390
If you ever find yourself needing to
solve a traveling salesman problem,

30
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,980
think carefully about what
assumptions you can make and

31
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,330
look up the best approximation
result for your case.

32
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,014
Chances are,

33
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:40,493
you won't be the first person to
encounter that version of the problem.
