1
00:00:00,216 --> 00:00:06,400
And the answer is 0.0079.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,049
In other words, there's only 0.79% chance,

3
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:15,217
0.79 out of 100 that, despite the positive test result,

4
00:00:15,217 --> 00:00:17,884
that you have cancer. And we're going to apply

5
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:19,934
the exact same mechanics as we did before.

6
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:25,296
The result of Bayes Rule, non-normalized of C given POS

7
00:00:25,296 --> 00:00:32,257
is simply the product of my prior probability, 0.001 times 0.8,

8
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:37,172
which is the probability of a positive result in the cancer state.

9
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:41,058
And that ends up to be 0.0008.

10
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:44,040
The non-normalized probability for the opposite event,

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,758
the non-cancerous event, given a positive test,

12
00:00:46,758 --> 00:00:55,207
is 0.999 times 0.1. And that's obviously 0.0999.

13
00:00:55,207 --> 00:01:02,690
Our normalizer is the sum of both of those, which is 0.1007

14
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,040
just add these two values up over here.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,041
So dividing 0.0008, the non-normalized probability,

16
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:14,762
by 0.1007 gives us 0.0079.

17
00:01:14,777 --> 00:01:18,573
We just applied Bayes Rule to compute a really involved

18
00:01:18,573 --> 99:59:59,999
probability of having cancer after seeing a test result.
