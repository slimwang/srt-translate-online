00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,970
Okay, so looking at this screenshot,
there are two TextViews at the top, and

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,050
I can say this because they
have two different text styles.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,800
For example, this one is a little
bit bigger and a little bit bolder.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,015
And now we have the YouTube logo
which is this red icon, and

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,695
so we use an ImageView to display it.

6
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:20,535
And then, last but not least, we have
two buttons at the bottom that you can

7
00:00:20,535 --> 00:00:24,885
tap to skip or go to next, and
we're done, so we can move on now.
