00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,041
Remember that in order to add 3x and 6x
together, I simply added their

2
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:08,665
coefficients and then multiplied by the
variable they both contain to get 9x,

3
00:00:08,665 --> 00:00:13,485
since 3 plus 6 is 9, and the variable in
both terms is x. We can do the same thing

4
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:19,595
to deal with the y terms over here. So
negative 5y plus 9y is going to be equal

5
00:00:19,595 --> 00:00:25,449
to whatever negative 5 plus 9 is times y.
We know that negative 5 plus 9 is equal to

6
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:31,564
4. So our answer is 4y. And we can fill
that in the box. Over here in our original

7
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:37,235
expression, we have four different terms.
And over here, we only have two terms.

8
00:00:37,562 --> 00:00:41,475
This is why we call this simplifying
expressions. This expression is way more

9
00:00:41,487 --> 00:00:45,555
simple than the one over here is. Remember
that I was allowed to put an equal sign

10
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:49,444
here, between these two expressions,
because they are exactly mathematically

11
00:00:49,444 --> 00:00:53,650
equivalent. In order to come up with the
expression over here, I only played with

12
00:00:53,662 --> 00:00:57,710
the terms inside of this expression. I
didn't bring anything in from the outside.

13
00:00:58,062 --> 00:01:00,807
The only way I modified it was by
squishing together things that were

14
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:01,392
already there.
