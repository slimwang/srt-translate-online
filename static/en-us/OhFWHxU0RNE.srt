1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,970
Let's start exploring cameras by
opening up a brand new Unity scene.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,370
Go to File &gt; New Scene.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,223
Now on the hierarchy locate
the main camera and click on that.

4
00:00:12,223 --> 00:00:14,614
Every time you create
a new scene in Unity,

5
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,882
it'll be populated with a main camera.

6
00:00:16,882 --> 00:00:17,745
Perfect!

7
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:21,950
Take a look at the inspector panel,
you should now see a camera component.

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,140
The camera component
has many properties.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,520
Let's look at them.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,900
First up, we have clear flags.

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,680
Clear flags are a property that
indicates what the camera should render

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,700
if, for a given pixel on our screen,
the camera does not see a 3D object.

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,760
Think of this as a control for
the background.

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,700
By default this is set to skybox.

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,800
Skyboxes are a wrapper
around your entire scene

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,590
that shows what the world
looks like beyond your models.

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:56,411
This could be a cityscape, the depths of
the ocean, or just the plain old sky.

18
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:57,199
At their core,

19
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,600
skyboxes are another type of material
which you learned about in lesson two.

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,680
So let's go create one.

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,790
In the project pane,
navigate to the Skyboxes folder.

22
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,080
Then create a new material and
let's call it sky.

23
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,970
In the inspector, select the shader
drop-down and select skybox procedural.

24
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,920
Unity has done an amazing job of making
it really easy to customize our sky.

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,550
As you can see,

26
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,310
there are several properties that allow
us to control the appearance of it.

27
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,220
Let's make a really small
change by changing the sky tint

28
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,100
to a nice sunset red.

29
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,620
As you can see,

30
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,150
making this change to this material did
not change the skybox set in the scene.

31
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,670
But if you look at the preview
at the bottom of the inspector,

32
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,690
you can see that we did
change our skybox material.

33
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,490
Let's apply our skybox to the camera.

34
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,990
Find the camera component in the
inspector and add a skybox component.

35
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,120
Drag and drop the sky material
into the material property

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,054
of our skybox component.

37
00:02:07,054 --> 00:02:10,639
Our skybox is still not
applied to our scene view.

38
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,730
However, if we look at the game view,
we'll see that it's now applied.

39
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,520
We'll talk more about sky
boxes in the next lesson and

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,740
how to apply them to our scene.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,320
But for now, know that they are a very
great way to efficiently show the user

42
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,800
distant objects like the sun or

43
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,740
sky without having to
create a 3D model for them.

44
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,865
Which is super cool.

45
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:35,240
Returning back to clear facts,
let's quickly check the other options.

46
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,980
Our second option is solid color.

47
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,750
As you can probably guess, this sets
the background to a single color,

48
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,270
which we can change with
the background property.

49
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,620
The depth only option is useful in
cases where we have multiple cameras.

50
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,030
For example,
in shooting mixed reality footage.

51
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,380
In that scenario, we need one virtual
camera to capture foreground content

52
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,540
without any background.

53
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,310
In creating VR applications, it's very
unlikely you'll need to use this but

54
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,910
still good to know it exists.

55
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,170
Lastly is the don't clear option.

56
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,114
Never use this for VR.

57
00:03:14,114 --> 00:03:17,342
The don't clear option uses
the image from the previous frame as

58
00:03:17,342 --> 00:03:19,144
the background for the next image.

59
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:23,820
This results in a very
disorienting experience.

60
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,955
And that covers clear flags and
skyboxes.

61
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:31,015
Next we'll be looking
at the culling mask.
