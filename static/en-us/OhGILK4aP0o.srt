00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,940
I came to be a partner
at YC actually because I

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,939
was also someone who went
through the program myself.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,350
I went through Y Combinator
in the Winter of 2006,

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:14,020
the first batch out here in California
and I founded a company called Wufoo.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,915
Wufoo was an online forum builder,
it helps create online surveys,

6
00:00:16,915 --> 00:00:19,890
power event registration, and
process simple online payments.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:26,881
Ran that company for five years and we
then sold that to Survey Monkey in 2011.

8
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:29,152
Interesting thing about that company,

9
00:00:29,152 --> 00:00:32,280
it is not your typical type
of Silicon Valley company.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,060
After we raised our funding,

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,250
after demo day, we purposely
only raised about $100,000 and

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,280
then we moved back to Florida on the
east coast and we operated out of there.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,530
We never had a centralized office so
it's complete remote working team, and

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,440
we only grew the company to
about ten people, on purpose.

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,520
There was a lot of money offered to us,
but we were relatively profitable

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,730
as a startup, so we never needed to take
any money from venture capitalists or

17
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,920
any other investors at the time.

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,874
And when we were acquired,
one of the interesting metrics

19
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:06,634
that sometimes we talk about is that
the average company that sold, or

20
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:11,636
required, or went IPO that year was
about, had raised $25 million and

21
00:01:11,636 --> 00:01:15,852
their average returns to their
investor was about 600%.

22
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:19,311
Wufoo only raised $100,000 for
the life of the company and

23
00:01:19,311 --> 00:01:22,286
our returns to our investor was like,
29,000%.

24
00:01:22,286 --> 00:01:25,119
So, a lot of what I work on with
companies that like combinators is

25
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,522
focusing on building the kind of company
that doesn't need to raise money from

26
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,583
other people and
being extremely efficient and

27
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,770
productive with the resources
they have at hand.
