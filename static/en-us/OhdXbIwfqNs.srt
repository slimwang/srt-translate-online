1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,510
Performance and
speed is something that user love.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,310
In order for
us to see what our performance is,

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,350
we need to look at the speed report.

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:16,500
Speed reports show us how different
request took in our app or site.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,190
You may want to track how quickly the
screens for each new level of the game

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,370
load, or how fast search result have
been brought back to the user's page.

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,080
You could also toggle between
different version of this report, and

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,020
I'll show you what to gain from the
distribution, and the overlay reports.

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,430
By the way, this report is important
enough to be taken to the dashboard so

10
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,170
you can face it on a daily basis.

11
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,870
In my last startup,
we also sent it on a weekly basis.

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,580
So we could see if and
how we improving after each new version.

13
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,300
The main metrics that you gain from
this reports is definitely to see

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,560
what is the average load
time of each and every page.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,960
And here you can see that I
definitely had a problem with my site

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,870
at the beginning of last May.

17
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,340
When we clicking on
the Distribution tab of this page,

18
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,940
we could definitely see what is going
on in different buckets, and that could

19
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,440
help us a lot to identify problematic
sections or buckets in our site.

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,500
Another very important aspect of this
report is to go to the Map Overlay.

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,310
It's important because
we want to see how

22
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,650
different users around the globe
are using and leveraging our site.

23
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:39,030
What is the global distribution,
let's say of the average user timing?

24
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,290
We could see here that the darker
shades indicates longer load time.

25
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,220
This report can show if your app or

26
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,650
site experience got any issues on
particular geographic regions.

27
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,830
It's especially important
if you are using CDNs or

28
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:00,530
stream content that depends on
a geolocation of your users.

29
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,460
Here for instance, you can see that
I clearly got some problems in Chile.

30
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,820
And luckily in the States and Canada,

31
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,020
and over Europe,
I'm quite in a good position.
