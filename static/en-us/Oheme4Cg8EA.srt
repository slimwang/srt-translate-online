1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,120
We can take these two images together,
these motion energy images and

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,110
this motion history image, and

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,360
together we refer to them as what
we call the temporal template.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,650
It was just the model
of how stuff moved.

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,320
All right?

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,830
And then we tried it on
a dataset that we created.

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,290
We had this person who was
way more fit than we were

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,910
do a whole bunch of different aerobics,
different moves.

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,500
And we just said, okay,
can we now recognize if somebody

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,460
is actually doing a new routine,
which aerobics move she's doing.

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,730
All right?

12
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,970
And one of the interesting
things that you can see here,

13
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,020
what I'm showing you here are the MEIs,
all right.

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,470
I'm just showing you the binary version.

15
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,360
And you might say, that this shape,
looks an awful lot like that shape.

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,240
But if I show you the motion history
image of the one on the top,

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,280
you see that, and you can see,
that it's dark down here,

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,590
and light up there, so that's an example
that the arms are moving upward.

19
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,660
When you take a look at this one,
you can see that it's high up here,

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,325
but high down there, so
it's actually going like this.

21
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:08,115
So the motion energy
image would be ambiguous.

22
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:09,705
It shows you where the stuff is.

23
00:01:09,705 --> 00:01:12,315
But the motion history image
resolves that ambiguity.

24
00:01:12,315 --> 00:01:16,845
The motion energy image
captures the whole image

25
00:01:16,845 --> 00:01:20,742
motioned area and captures it nicely.

26
00:01:20,742 --> 00:01:25,472
So that's why it's not in some sense
redundant with the motion history image,

27
00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:29,312
which gives a lot more weight to
the more recently moving pixels.
