00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Now, before we go deeper into the algorithm,

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,710
let's just make sure that you understand the problem that Alice has to work on.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:10,210
So let's take this very simple communications network here,

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,680
and what I would like you to do is to figure out the minimum number of devices

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,250
that would need to be installed in this network in order to monitor the whole network.

6
00:00:19,250 --> 99:59:59,999
And please enter your answer as a number in here.
