00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,900
So today we've talked about meta-reasoning. This very strongly leveraged and

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,035
built on nearly everything we've talked about so far in this course.

3
00:00:07,035 --> 00:00:10,140
Meta-reasoning is, in many ways, reasoning about everything we've covered so

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,930
far. We started off by recapping learning from correcting mistakes and

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,020
the related notion of gaps. Then we covered two broad metacognitive techniques

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,960
called strategy selection and strategy integration. We then discussed whether or

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,890
not meta-meta-reasoning might exist. And

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,340
we decided, ultimately, that such a distinction isn't even necessary. After all,

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,770
the structures involved in meta-reasoning, like cases, and

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,340
rules, and models, and the same as those involved in a reasoning,

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,175
itself. So, meta-reasoning is already equipped to reason about itself. Finally,

12
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:40,255
we discussed a particular example of meta-reasoning, called goal-based autonomy.

13
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:43,510
Meta-reasoning is in many ways the capstan of our course.

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,120
It covers reasoning of all the topics we've covered so far, and

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,280
it provides a way that they can be used in conjunction with one another.

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,950
We do have a few more things to talk about though, and

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,680
we'll cover those in our Advanced Topics lesson.
