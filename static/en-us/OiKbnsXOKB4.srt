1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,440
You can think of, the first one
is the default discard policy.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,170
The second one,
is similar to default allowed policy or

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,850
default forward policy.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,370
The third one is in between the two.

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,570
The first one accepts only
packets it knows are safe.

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,020
It is similar to default,
discard policy.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,890
In terms of security,
it is the best among the three.

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,470
In terms of ease of use, it is the
worst, because it may stop traffic that

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,490
is actually safe and useful to user,
but the firewall does not know it yet.

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,390
The second one,
drops packets it knows are unsafe.

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,880
In terms of security,
this is the worse because

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,300
of our knowledge about packets or
what traffic is unsafe is limited.

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,470
Because attackers are constantly
implementing new methods.

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,190
But in terms of ease of use,
it is the best.

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,820
Because the users will have access to
most of the traffic that they want.

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,290
The third one,
queries user about questionable packets.

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,820
This is in between the two.

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,890
Therefore, its security
is in between a two, and

19
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,690
ease of use is also in between a two.
