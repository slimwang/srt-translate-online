1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,895
The solution is that we need to call

2
00:00:01,895 --> 00:00:05,760
Fragment.setHasOptionsMenu(true). That way, we'll

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,910
get appropriate options menu callback

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,850
methods in the fragment, so that we can

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,120
inflate the menu and for when a menu item

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,190
is selected. And this is where the fragment

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,760
inflates the menu. Remember from before that in the

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,310
ForecastFragment class, we have a public empty constructor, and

9
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,650
we also override onCreateView? We also define fetchWeatherTask here.

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,020
Now, we're going to overide an additional fragment life

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,340
cycle method called onCreate. This is where the fragment

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,691
is created, and this happens before the onCreate view

13
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:37,790
method, which is where the UI gets initialized. So, in

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,570
onCreate, we're going to call setHasOptionsMenu to be true to

15
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,430
indicate that we want call backs for these methods.

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,560
When onCreateOptionsMenu is called, we're going to inflate the menu

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,510
layout that we defined earlier called forecast fragment. We'll also

18
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,090
get notified when a menu item is selected. When a menu item with

19
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,350
ID action refresh is called, we're going to

20
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,030
return true for now. We're going to go

21
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,140
over the activity and fragment life cycle methods in more detail in later

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,110
lessons, but if you want, you can read the documentation linked below for now.
