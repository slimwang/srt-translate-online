1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This next question is about an application of symmetric ciphers.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
To exploit the BEAST vulnerability in HTTPS,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
suppose an attacker has intercepted the ciphertext, using 4-bit blocks.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
C0, the first block of the intercepted ciphertext, is 1000

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
as the result of encrypting m0, the first block in the message.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
C1 is the result of encrypting the second block of the message,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and C2 the result of encrypting the third block of the message.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Our attacker wants to find if m1, the second block in the intercepted message

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
is equal to 1010.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The question is what should the attacker use as the target value for m0',

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
which is the first block and the next response.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Your answer should be 4 bits long.
