1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,020
What better way than ask you what you

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,460
think are the functionalities that should be provided by

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,850
an Operating System. So here are some choices

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,200
I'm giving you in this question, and what I

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,830
want you to mark off or select are

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,980
choices that you think describe the functionalities that should

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,180
be provided by an Operating System. And, more

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,930
than one of these choices may apply to the

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,010
functionality that you expect from an Operating

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,851
System. So go ahead and choose these

11
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:35,010
correct choices. The first choice is, Operating

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,990
System is a resource manager. The second choice

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,580
says, the Operating System provides a consistent

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,810
interface for the hardware resources such as

15
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,830
CPU, memory and so on. The third

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,950
choice says, the Operating System schedules applications on

17
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:57,910
the CPU. The fourth choice says, the Operating System stores personal

18
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:03,430
information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, e-mail

19
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,810
addresses and so on. So, pick the things that you

20
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,980
think are functionalities that you expect an operating system to provide.
