Congratulations, I'm guessing this problem took you a bit to figure out. My

2
00:00:04,736 --> 00:00:09,088
teaching assistant Congard de Kana came up with this problem so it was fun for

3
00:00:09,088 --> 00:00:13,318
me to solve in my own way. The key insight for me was that each step needed to

4
00:00:13,318 --> 00:00:17,562
be a constant distance up and forward from the previous step. From the second

5
00:00:17,562 --> 00:00:21,316
step I started by adding the height of the first step to its location. This

6
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:25,525
first step's height is the vertical step's pieces height plus the step's

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,500
thickness. The other piece of the puzzle is how far forward the second step is

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,880
from the first. From the diagram we see that this is the horizontal step depth

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,845
minus the step thickness. With these two values in hand I could create a loop to

10
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:42,346
generate all of the steps. Here's my code. At the top I computed the height and

11
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:46,751
depth I needed to offset between each step. Through experimentation I found I

12
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:51,008
needed to make six steps with my loop. On each loop iteration I modified both

13
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:55,818
the vertical and horizontal parts of the step by adding in the height and depth

14
00:00:55,818 --> 00:00:56,443
offsets.
