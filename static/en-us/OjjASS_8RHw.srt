00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, I have a question for you. The rows here, are

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,830
the various collision avoidance strategies that

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,210
we have discussed, and the columns,

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,030
are the merits that these strategies might have. For each column,

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,890
check the row, if you think that strategy, has the given merit.
