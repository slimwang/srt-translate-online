00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,510
Here's the equation we found. I'm going to rewrite this equation by dividing by

2
00:00:04,522 --> 00:00:08,835
2. I'm going to just change what it looks like. Notice, if I divide both sides

3
00:00:08,847 --> 00:00:13,195
of the equation by 2, I need to be careful on this side. I need to take the 2

4
00:00:13,207 --> 00:00:17,600
and divide it into each term, both the 2l and the 2w. I get p divided by 2

5
00:00:17,612 --> 00:00:22,384
equals l plus w. This p divided by 2 might look funny. But we know dividing by a

6
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:27,161
number is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal. So, I can rewrite this as p

7
00:00:27,173 --> 00:00:31,870
times 1 half. So, I have p times one half. This should connect to your drawing.

8
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:36,221
I know if I go half way around the parameter I should only be at l plus w.

9
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:40,858
Notice, it is l plus w, that's half way around the rectangle. We know the

10
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,761
perimeter of the rectangle is 52 feet so I am going to write that here. The

11
00:00:45,773 --> 00:00:50,420
length of the rectangle is 6 feet more than the width. So, I can write the

12
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:55,725
length being equal to w plus 6. The length is 6 more than the width. Now, we can

13
00:00:55,737 --> 00:01:01,215
make a substitution. Wherever I see the letter l, I can replace it with w plus

14
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:06,620
6. And wherever I see the letter p, I can replace it with 52 feet. We have a

15
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:11,870
half times 52 equals w plus 6 plus w. We made the substitution so we could work

16
00:01:11,882 --> 00:01:16,944
with one equation and one variable. Now, we can actually solve for this one

17
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:21,401
variable. I'm going to leave that up to you. Enter the width here and the length

18
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:25,207
here. And don't worry about writing units, I've got those for you.
