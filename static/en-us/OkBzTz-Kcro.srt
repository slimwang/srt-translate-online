1
00:00:00,251 --> 00:00:02,252
And so you've been at NVIDIA for 4 years?

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,916
Yeah, just over 4 years.

3
00:00:03,916 --> 00:00:06,337
And you have had kind of an interesting path to get there.

4
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:08,380
So tell us a little bit about your background.

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,782
So my background is actually not computing.

6
00:00:10,782 --> 00:00:14,269
I believe I've never had a computing class in my life,

7
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:16,976
which is not necessarily a claim to fame,

8
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:20,270
but my background is actually fluid mechanics and plasma physics.

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:27,003
So from engineering days it turned out that you can't do physics without computing.

10
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:32,711
When I graduated in '96, the whole world was already moving towards that--

11
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:35,446
computing and science connected.

12
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:39,177
But I was young and it seemed much more interesting to go and write computer games,

13
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:40,995
so I went and wrote computer games for a while,

14
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:44,085
went and worked for the military in high-performance computing,

15
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:48,085
went to work for a bunch of start-ups, and somehow meandered my way around to NVIDIA.
