00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,060
So far we've been looking at cameras but we've been actually looking at

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,470
the details of the optics, that is how light enters through the optics.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,510
And of course at the back,

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,810
at the focal lens of the camera where the image is formed.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,160
Now let's talk about how to save the image.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,890
In this kind of camera, a film camera, a film is placed here and

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:23,040
it's the chemical process of the film that takes the light and preserves it.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,800
By changing the chemistry on the film and that is stored to create prints.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,740
And this lesson will talk about the composition of the film itself.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,399
But also, since we are actually moving to the world of digital photography we'll

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,735
talk about the composition.

12
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:41,591
And how something like a CCD, a charge couple device, is used to save

13
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:46,975
information in an electronic form or electrical energy form, from light.

14
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:49,462
We'll also discuss concepts of bare filtering,

15
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:52,000
that allow us to talk about different colors.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,620
And also a CMOS sensor, which is the one that's widely in use for

17
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,160
all the cameras that we actually currently use these days.
