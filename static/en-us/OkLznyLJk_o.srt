00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,698
Here, I've taken the two solutions to the equation we solved before and I'd like

2
00:00:04,698 --> 00:00:09,327
you to multiply them together. So what is 3 plus 4i times 3 minus 4i? I'd like

3
00:00:09,327 --> 00:00:13,791
you to work all these out by hand but before you do, think about what pattern

4
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:18,327
you see here or how these two factors relate to one another and try to predict

5
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:20,867
what kind of answer you'll get over here.
