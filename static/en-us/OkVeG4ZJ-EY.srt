1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,609
So, congratulations.

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:02,770
You just wrote a program.

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:03,760
Awesome.

4
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,360
But it would never end there in reality.

5
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,600
When writing software, it's very common for requirements to change.

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,110
In fact, it's usually the case.

7
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,450
Requirements can change because you got an idea while you

8
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,930
were writing the application.

9
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,450
They can change because you have a fickle manager.

10
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,390
They can also change because the needs of your target audience

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,190
have changed since you've started working on the project originally.

12
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,360
Now, this course is ultimately about teaching you to write extensible and

13
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,630
well organized code.

14
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,470
Largely so you can react to those changes in the project requirements.

15
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,260
Let's talk to a few other experts in software development, and

16
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,231
see how often requirements change for them.

17
00:00:41,957 --> 00:00:45,140
>> Requirements change for every single project.

18
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,140
In fact, almost every single meeting for

19
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,470
a project leads to a requirements change.

20
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,940
>> Requirements can change at any time.

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,860
They can change weeks before the project, or

22
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,070
they can change the night before it launches.

23
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,089
>> We change requirements on the engineers all the time.

24
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,880
Well at university, in engineers are actually responsible for

25
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,940
defining their own requirements.

26
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,960
But regardless of whoever is defining the requirements they keep

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,110
changing all the time because the product keeps evolving.

28
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,950
And the requirements change because we keep on

29
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,130
discovering new ways of improving the user experience.

30
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:26,250
And that leads to often changing specs and requirements for the product.
