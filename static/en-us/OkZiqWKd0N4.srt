1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go through it together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The JavaScript equivalent of def is function.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We write out the keyword function.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Then we pick a name for our function.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I asked you to call it uptoten.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We mention all of its arguments,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and then we use an opening curly brace instead of colon.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The word if remains unchanged. Less than is unchanged.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But again, instead of a colon we're going to use an opening curly brace.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Here is our answer.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If x is less than 10, we return x. Otherwise, we return 10.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Again, the big differences are these curly braces, which must be balanced.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
They have to match up, but we already know how to do that instead of colons and indenting.
