1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
Let's take a look at value proposition.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,240
Value proposition is not something you're building in isolation.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,980
While the value proposition is about solving a customer problem or need,

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,490
it really consists of 3 components.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,630
The easy one for most entrepreneurs to talk about is what product features you have

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,780
or what product services you're providing.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,280
But there's actually 2 more important components to value proposition:

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,880
What gain are you creating for customers?

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,350
And what pain are you solving for them?

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,580
Alexander Osterwalder, when he drew the business model canvas,

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,170
really emphasized this. It's not just about your product.

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,850
And especially if you come from a technical background, it's really easy to say,

13
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,850
"Oh, look at all these features."

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,390
And if you find yourself doing that, you need to complete the sentence and say,

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,160
"Yes, but here's what we make people be able to do better,

16
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,640
"and here are the problems we solve for them."

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,130
So the real goal of you figuring out the value proposition

18
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,560
is understanding what we call the minimal viable product.

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,020
You're trying to figure out, "Now that I kind of understand my product and service

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,380
"and what I'm gaining for customers and the pain I'm solving,

21
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,270
"what's the smallest possible feature set I could be shipping on day 1

22
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,650
"that solves these pains and creates gains for them?"

23
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,920
And this really is an interactive process

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,810
because there is no way, no possible way, sitting in your office you could figure this out.

25
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,060
And the default for great engineers and great entrepreneurs is,

26
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,640
"Oh, I understand customers' problems and needs,

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,740
"so don't worry about it. We'll just spec the entire product on day 1."

28
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,870
Your real goal here is to figure out what's the smallest thing you could build and develop

29
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,460
that actually gets you users or sales or whatever

30
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,560
and get out to market as quickly as possible.

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,590
And so the goal of you getting out of the building for value proposition

32
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,450
is understanding gains and pains so you can figure out what's the MVP,

33
00:02:00,450 --> 99:59:59,999
or minimum viable product.
