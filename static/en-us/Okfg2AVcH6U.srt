00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,620
We're going to build JSON
to describe some data.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,009
Here's an example.

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,849
We can see that our contact has
name parts as well as the title.

4
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:12,707
This would turn into this JSON.

5
00:00:12,707 --> 00:00:14,690
Now it's your turn.

6
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:16,989
Build JSON to describe this data
