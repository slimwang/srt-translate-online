1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,870
Maps, everybody uses them and
many people love them.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,150
Maps on mobile devices like this one
have changed the world over the last

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,160
few years.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,230
It's not that long ago you had to carry
a paper map of any location you weren't

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,520
familiar with.

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,960
Or like me, as soon as you arrive at
an airport, you'd study the route to

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,020
the hotel, memorizing it so you wouldn't
have to stop in a strange place and

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,020
unfold a large piece of paper to
figure out where you were going.

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,940
Mobile maps not only provide
a local map in your pocket, but

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,570
also a map of the entire
world down to street level.

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,560
They also include cool things such as a
view of the street as if you were there

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,770
or a 3D fly-around of many major cities.

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,810
There are so many ways that maps
can help you build a better app.

14
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,270
Maybe you have a business and you want
to direct people to that business.

15
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,280
Why not build an app that provides
navigation to your business from where

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,610
they are using location services that
you can learn in one of our modules?

17
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,490
Or maybe you want to create a treasure
hunt game, or plant a geocache.

18
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,040
You can even do this virtually,

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,260
where instead of hiding objects in the
real world, you put them in the virtual

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,580
world, with pins on a map that
your users will then have to find.

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,940
There are far more scenarios
than I can think of and

22
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,120
I bet you have a few
doozies of your own.

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,300
In this lesson,
you'll learn all about Google Maps and

24
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,790
how you can build them
into your android apps.
