00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,600
So today we've talked about common sense reasoning. Broadly, common sense

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,960
reasoning gives us a formal structure to interpret the world around us.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,708
Having that formal structure let's us build agents that can then do the same.

4
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:13,930
We started off with primitive actions, which like primitives in programming,

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,890
are the simplest things we can interpret out the world. Then we looked at

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,750
composing those primitive actions into bigger actions. For a hierarchical,

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,880
abstract view of the world. We then looked at how those primitives can

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,340
cause state changes, which let us predict the effect or cause of certain events.

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,710
Next time, we're going to compose these simple frames into much longer stories,

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,550
called scripts. Scripts help us make sense of complex repeated events with

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,750
relative ease, and generate expectations about the world around us.
