1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
Now back to our initial question.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,440
What does all of this mean for Alice, Bob, and Carol?

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,410
We have already seen that

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,480
the problems they are trying to solve are contained in NP

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,730
and so what we could now try is

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,130
to show that their problems are actually

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,020
NP complete.

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,010
To do that, what we need to do is

9
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,000
we need to reduce SAT

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,200
to one of their problems,

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,350
and we're going to do this with clique.

12
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,960
It's also possible to do this with vertex cover or independent set,

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,630
but clique is actually one of the easier ones to see.

14
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,930
And now what we need to show is

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,100
for any given instance of SAT,

16
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,770
so for any Boolean formula, if you will,

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,470
we can transform it

18
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,150
into an input for the clique problem

19
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,200
in polynomial time such that clique

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,320
as a decision problem will say yes

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,470
if the Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment

22
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,320
and no otherwise,

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,290
and once we achieve this, we know that clique is NP complete

24
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,670
and since we have already seen there are polynomial time reductions

25
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,930
between clique, vertex, and independent set,

26
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,459
if clique is NP complete,

27
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,770
then these 2 problems here are also NP complete

28
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,220
which of course will mean that

29
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,360
not only will Bob be very unhappy about this,

30
00:01:11,360 --> 99:59:59,999
but Alice and Carol will be in this together, as well.
