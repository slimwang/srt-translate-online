1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,480
All of these are true. This is all the data that we have. There's no way to

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,560
calculate a mean or standard deviation. And the data are based on frequencies

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,200
and proportions. The proportion of successful attempts out of unsuccessful

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,120
attempts for Summit Up. And for the whole population of everyone that has

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,518
attempted to climb Mount Shasta. The data is nominal. Successful versus

6
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:29,130
unsuccessful. And finally the data are not based on normal distributions.

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,440
They're just frequencies. If we go into this point a little bit more, what

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,780
would our raw data look like? If we could document each attempt to climb Mount

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,090
Shasta. The first, second, third, all the way to n. the result would either be

10
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:53,860
success or failure. Rather than writing out n success or failures, we'll just

11
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,530
count the number of successes and failures and either write them as a frequency

12
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,277
or proportion where the proportion of successes plus failures has to add to 1.
