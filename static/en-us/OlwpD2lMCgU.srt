00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,890
In this lesson, 
we learned how to create

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,560
rich, responsive user interfaces
that work across a variety

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,530
of different hardware types 
and screen sizes.

00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,920
We also learned more details
on the Android layout managers

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,240
and screen widgets,

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,570
and even how to create
our own views from scratch.

00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,960
Join us for lesson six where 
we take our foreground-only app

00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,860
and discover how
to make it update and trigger

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,670
notifications from the background.

10
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,670
All without draining your battery.

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,462
But first, join me back at Google
