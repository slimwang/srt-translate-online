1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,812
The first choice is true. Objects definitely get dimmer the further they are

2
00:00:03,812 --> 00:00:06,982
from a light source. The number of photons hitting a surface drops off

3
00:00:06,982 --> 00:00:10,403
proportional to the square of the distance from the light. The second choice is

4
00:00:10,403 --> 00:00:13,480
false. There's no reason that objects wouldn't have colors. Well, maybe if all

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,908
the objects in the closet were gray, but that's not a fair assumption. The third

6
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:21,604
choice is also false. Even though you're at the light source's location, the

7
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:25,222
objects can receive different amounts of photons, depending on their distance

8
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:29,162
from and angle to the light. The fourth choice is true. This is the main point

9
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:34,055
of this question. What the light sees, by definition, is not in shadow. We'll

10
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:37,243
use this fact later in the course to generate shadows on objects.
