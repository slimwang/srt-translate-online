The fourth foundational concept is information hiding,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,850
which is also called encapsulation. This is the extent to which

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:11,340
the implementation details of a system are hidden behind abstract interfaces,

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,140
thereby protecting other parts of the program from changes to those details.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,020
Information hiding is one way to reduce the coupling of a system.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,650
On the other hand, the use of inheritance can violate information hiding by

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,790
making parent classes implementation details, details visible to child classes.

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,930
This principle was developed by David Parnas.
