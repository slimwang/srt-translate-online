The answer is 276, and I hope you didn't work this out

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
by counting them all.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There's an easy way to solve the value of the totient when n is prime,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and that is if n is prime, that means that all of the positive integers

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
less than n are relatively prime to n,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so the totient of n is n-1 for prime number n.
