1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, let's have a look at the zoo of methods that we've seen so far

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and then let's add one further method to that collection.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The forward Euler method work by starting from the current value

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and then incrementing that by step size h times the rate of change at the current point.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm writing f for the rate of change here.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Heun method also known as the improved or the modified Euler method

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
advances by the time step times the average of the rate of change at the beginning

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
plus the rate of change at the position predicted by the forward Euler method.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
With the forward Euler method, the error of a numerical solution grows linearly with step size.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If you double the step size, the global error also doubles approximately at least.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The forward Euler method is a method of order 1. This function, the error grows like hÂ¹.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Heun method, however, is the solver of order 2. The error grows like h squared.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If you take half the step size, the error is shrinking to one quarter, which is much more efficient.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For the backward Euler method, you advance by the rate of change at the new position,

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
which makes this equation difficult--it's an implicit equation.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
To complete our zoo of methods, we add a method that looks like Heun method

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
but is implicit like the backward Euler method.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This new rule is called the trapezoidal rule. Like Heun method, it's a method of order 2.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And if you compare these equations, they look pretty similar.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The trapezoidal rule advances by the average of the rate of change at the beginning

21
00:01:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the rate of change at the end, which means that this is an implicit equation.
