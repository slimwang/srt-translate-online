1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now we can come up with an equation for the motion of the moon around the earth.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The earth should be sitting at the origin of our coordinate system.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The moon should be starting on the x axis

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and should be moving in a counterclockwise direction.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Of course, there's something with cosine and sine.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Specify the details.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What do we have in front of the cosine and sine?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Is it 4 x 10⁸ m, is it 27 days, is it 2.5 x 10⁻⁹ m,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
or is it 2π x 27 days?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What's on the inside of cosine and sine?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
2π x t, or t, or π x t?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Then times, or divided by?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
27 days, or 4 x 10⁸ m?
