00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[Thrun] So in this quiz I've given you a very small image of 3 by 3,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and I'd like you to apply a kernel that's about like the previous one,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
except I flipped the left and right side over here.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And just apply this kernel to this image over here.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We're going to receive a 3 by 2 image in this case.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So please fill in all these 6 values over here.
