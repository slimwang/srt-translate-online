1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,070
Okay, so you created your first relationship. This is how

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,400
we get objects to communicate with each other. And this is

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,850
where things get really interesting. Because of the relationship between the

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,880
parent object Festival and the child object, Attendee, you can now

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,280
aggregate all sorts of useful information. For example, if you want to

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,270
know how many tickets you sold, you can now get that

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,590
information directly from the Festival object. In fact, the information on

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,060
the child object is now accessible by the parent object, and

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,720
vice versa. Later, when you start building more

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,240
complex business logic, you'll see how important and powerful

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,020
the relationship between objects becomes. See if you can

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,640
identify the parent in each of the following scenarios.
