00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,744
We can also think of these inputs as one set, and these outputs as another set.

2
00:00:04,744 --> 00:00:09,214
Our relation is a rule that describes the relationship between this set of

3
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:13,773
inputs and this set of outputs. In this case, the relationship is the vowels

4
00:00:13,773 --> 00:00:18,617
found in each persons name. This relation though is actually very special, it's

5
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:23,776
actually a function. A function is unique because the inputs always give the

6
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:28,905
same outputs. For example, Bob will always give us a letter o. Functions may

7
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:34,105
have two different inputs like Tim and Jill that both produce the same output,

8
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:39,177
in this case Jill and Tim both give us i. This is okay. This would not be a

9
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:44,484
function because we can never have two different outputs, a and o, for one

10
00:00:44,484 --> 00:00:49,757
input, in this case, Bob. For a function, each input must correspond with

11
00:00:49,757 --> 00:00:55,190
exactly one output. So there can only be one arrow leading from any input to an

12
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:55,820
output.
