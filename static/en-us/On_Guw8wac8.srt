1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Suppose we throw a fair die twice. What do you think the probability of a double is?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Double means both outcomes are identical with the same number regardless of what that number is.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The actually an important number because in many games involving two dice,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
have different rules when these come up with the same number.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, it might be important to know what the probability is.
