1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,100
It might help you to think about
your to do list as an object

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:08,260
called TodoList that contains
objects called Items.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,232
Objects have attributes or properties.

4
00:00:10,232 --> 00:00:15,220
A TodoList will have a title,
a list of Items and

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,710
Items will have a description,
an ID, and a completion status.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,220
Objects also have methods,
or actions they can perform.

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,220
You will want to be able to add or
remove items from a to-do list.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,390
You will also want to be able to update
it's status from not done to done.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,400
You should also have print methods for
both of them,

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,530
because what good is a to-do list
if you can't actually see the list?

11
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,630
Finally, you need a way
to create the object.

12
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,260
That's what the initialize
method is for.

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,630
As you continue to work on your program,

14
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,590
you might add to this list and
that's fine.

15
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,400
For now, we're just brainstorming
the basic structure of our classes.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,590
You can always add to this later.
