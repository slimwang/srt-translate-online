00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,500
Firstly we'll need to update our parseAtlastDefinition function to take into

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,920
account if a sprite has been trimmed, using this data to modify the corner x and

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,478
corner y offset values. This is important because if you recall the coordinate

4
00:00:13,478 --> 00:00:18,041
system of the canvas will place an image according to its top left corner. Well,

5
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:22,521
the trimming process in texture picker can move the top left corner to the new

6
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:26,764
trimmed location. As such, we need to refer to the trim data against the source

7
00:00:26,764 --> 00:00:30,670
data to figure out what the proper offset is to draw the sprite in the correct

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,596
location. With this in mind you need to update the parse atlas definition to

9
00:00:34,596 --> 00:00:38,500
take into account the differences between the framed version and the source

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,343
version to properly update the offset values so that the sprite draws in the

11
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,341
right location.
