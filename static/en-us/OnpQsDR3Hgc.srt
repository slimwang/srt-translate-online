00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,828
When we reflected this function in the x axis, we ended up with a new equation,

2
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:08,485
this one. So we can see that all that we did was replace the square root of x

3
00:00:08,485 --> 00:00:14,336
by negative square root x. Now in terms of functions, if we said that our

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:18,620
original equation was y equals f of x, then what we see with our reflection in

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:24,824
the x axis is y equals negative f of x. Reflection in the X axis just involves

6
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:29,528
negating the entire function that we're working with. But what about reflection

7
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:32,664
in the y-axis, we've seen one example of a graph showing that before, but what

8
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:37,906
happens with the equation? Well, going back to our three simple points that we

9
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:42,854
saw before, where did they end up if we reflected them in the y-axis? Please

00:00:42,854 --> 00:00:45,390
fill in the coordinates of the new reflected points here
