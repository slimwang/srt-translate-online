00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this unit, we're going to talk about forms and how you get data

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
from your browser to a web server, and we're not going to spend a whole lot of time here

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
on the sketch pad today, but first things first.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What I want you to do is open a text file in your editor of choice

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and put some text in it.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm in my editor here, and I'm just going to add some text, kind of standard text.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I save this file as play.html,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and the next thing I want you to do is open this file in your web browser of choice.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What we have here is the text that I entered in the editor here in the browser,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and if we were to go back to the editor and change something--

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
we'll change our word here--save it and then go back to the browser and reload,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
you can see it live updates, so this is a handy way for kind of

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
playing with and experimenting with HTML in a real browser,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and we're going to be doing a fair amount of this today.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The first thing I want to teach you about is HTML forms

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and the elements required to make them.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We have another tag called "form," and it looks like this.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And like many HTML tags, it has a closing form.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We're going to go back and forth here, between our editor and our browser

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and here while I'm explaining things.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's enter this in our editor.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Here we are in our editor.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to replace this text with that basic HTML tag I just showed you,

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay, there we go.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We're going to save this, and we're going to go back to our browser and reload the page.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Nothing is there. And why is that?

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Because we didn't enter any content.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let's talk about the content that goes in an HTML form.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There are a few things that can go in here, one of which is an element called input,

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
which looks like this.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let's enter that in our HTML editor.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay, now we go back to our browser, and we reload this.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
A-ha.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Now we have an input box, and we can type things in this box.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Pretty cool, huh?

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The input tag can take a couple of attributes,

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
one of which is called "name," and name looks like this.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's like all attributes.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We have the actual attribute, which in this case is called "name,"

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and then the value, which I've written here in red.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,466
This can be whatever we want.
