1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,420
So, Izabel, let's brainstorm and come up with the perfect

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,970
pizza app for Android. What would your top three features be?

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,730
>> My top three features would be

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,400
seasonal recommendations. Because I think people like

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,840
to order new things all the time

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,644
and why not take advantage of seasonal ingredients.

7
00:00:15,644 --> 00:00:16,550
>> Second one?

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,930
>> The second thing I would choose would be, a filtered ingredient list.

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:20,990
>> Oh.

10
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,080
>> because some people have food preferences. Like, they can't eat

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,570
gluten or they're vegan. So, just remove stuff that they can't

12
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,050
eat, completely off the menu. Just filter it

13
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,425
for them. [CROSSTALK] And third would be Google

14
00:00:29,425 --> 00:00:31,570
Wallet because this is for Android and that's

15
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,832
the primary way people pay for stuff on Android.

16
00:00:33,832 --> 00:00:35,360
>> Oh, it's fantastic.

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,394
>> So, what about you, what would your, what do

18
00:00:37,394 --> 00:00:39,860
you think the top three features for this app should be?

19
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,365
>> For me, they're actually a bit different. My number one feature would be

20
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:47,300
one-click ordering. Cause I think that the

21
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,630
user would really enjoy very quickly ordering

22
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,530
a pizza for the first time and also coming back and

23
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,780
making repeat orders. The second feature I would pick is, order history.

24
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,090
This would allow someone to find out what they placed an

25
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,620
order for before and see how much money they're spending on pizza.

26
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,200
>> Okay.

27
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,420
>> And finally, I think that the user would really

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,440
appreciate real time status updates. Because I know that if they're

29
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,960
hungry and they want their pizza delivered, they would want to

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,000
know where it is and when it's going to get there.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,120
>> Perfect.

32
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,470
So, looking at these features, it kind of seems

33
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,330
like the three features you picked are classic

34
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,040
you. Because you're a creature of habit, and

35
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,830
you always order the same food every single time.

36
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,170
>> That's true.

37
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,430
>> So you can get back to coding. You think of food as fuel.

38
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,730
>> I do think of food as fuel. Who doesn't?

39
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,670
>> Yes, and order history, you're like super detailed

40
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,660
with your finances so that kind of makes sense for you.

41
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,200
>> That's true. Good point.

42
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,340
>> And status updates. You're always checking like every five

43
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,190
seconds when your packages don't arrive so, you know, I'm noticing

44
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,160
a trend here. That these are, this kind of sounds like the Nazmul pizza app.

45
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,640
>> It does. It's funny you mentioned

46
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,570
that because your features reflect very much

47
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,830
who you are. Like, you are a foodie. You're extremely picky about what you eat.

48
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,110
>> Yes.

49
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,160
>> And so the seasonal recommendations make sense, and also the menu

50
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,450
filtering is a good option for you because you don't like gluten.

51
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:00,900
>> Yep.

52
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,550
>> And the Google Wallet makes sense, because you are super-fan Android user.

53
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,280
>> Yeah, these features

54
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,008
are kind of classic me.

55
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:10,110
>> So what are your favorite features, and do

56
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,500
they reflect on who you are? Are they classic you?
