1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,738
You've made it.
You're just about at the end of

2
00:00:02,738 --> 00:00:03,879
the course.

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:07,259
You probably feel proud of having
accomplished your goal and have rewarded

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,390
yourself with ice cream or a new
video game, well, that's what we did.

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,260
>> Anyway, inevitably you will have
questions while developing your million

6
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:16,329
dollar baby.

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,380
And you probably won't come back to
the course, so where should you go?

8
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:22,879
>> Our team of developers,
technically writers and

9
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,074
other awesome folks keep all the Google
maps API reference documentation,

10
00:00:27,074 --> 00:00:32,048
walk-throughs, sample code and other
useful tips on our developers site.

11
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:34,519
We've linked to it a bunch of
times throughout the course, and

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,140
there's another URL in the notes below.

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,370
>> In the web area of the site,
you'll find most of

14
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:43,839
the information on the JavaScript API
that we presented in this course.

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,520
You can drill down into the Reference
section of the documentation for

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,640
each API to get the technical details
on all the classes, methods, and

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,070
objects we've used.

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,950
There's also plenty of sample
code you can view that

19
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,090
looks suspiciously similar to some of
the examples we've seen in the course.

20
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,770
>> In the Web Services section you can
see information on the services we've

21
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,820
demonstrated through HTTP requests.

22
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:09,839
You can drill down into each
individual service to get the details

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,760
on the request parameters and responses.

24
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:16,829
>> You can visit the Android and iOS
sections of the site to learn more about

25
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:21,469
incorporating the Goggle Maps APIs
into your native mobile applications.

26
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:24,638
Most of the features are similar
to those that we've covered for

27
00:01:24,638 --> 00:01:26,230
JavaScript API in this course.

28
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,890
>> There is also a great FAQ, which
should be your first line of defense for

29
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:31,722
questions on the Google Maps APIs.

30
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:35,558
The FAQ also have a section on
understanding the terms of service,

31
00:01:35,558 --> 00:01:38,929
quotas and usage limits and
identifiers, like API keys.

32
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:43,780
>> If you have a specific coding
question, we encourage all of our Maps

33
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,680
developers to use Stack Overflow to post
questions and contribute to solutions.

34
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,141
>> If you are, or are looking into
becoming a premium plan customer,

35
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:56,420
remember, some use cases require that,
there's a great online resource for

36
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,500
information on the premium plan.

37
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:02,899
This includes things like terms of use,
quotas and rates, support and SLA, and

38
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,350
tips and tricks for using your licence.

39
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:09,099
Finally, if you enjoyed this course,
there are some great channels for

40
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:11,370
more information on
the Google Maps APIs.

41
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,700
For example,
the Geo Developers blog, and

42
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:16,989
our Google developers YouTube channel
linked in the instructor notes.

43
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,490
>> Well, it's been a great journey, but
now I have to go back to New York and

44
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,870
get back to my real job.

45
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,733
Working with developers
using the Google Maps APIs.

46
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:27,152
>> And I have to go home to my new baby.

47
00:02:27,152 --> 00:02:31,691
>> Luckily I mapped it and it'll
only take me 957 hours to walk home,

48
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:33,818
but I couldn't avoid ferries.

49
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:35,657
>> I think I'll probably
roller blade back home.

50
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:38,056
>> Thanks for taking the course.

51
00:02:38,056 --> 00:02:39,950
>> And happy mapping.
