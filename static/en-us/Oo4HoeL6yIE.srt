00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,820
Let me introduce to you my favorite
screen reader, called voice over.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,090
Voice over is a speech
software that allows

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,520
people who are blind to vision impaired
to read information on the screen.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,290
Voiceover is built into Mac OS ten, so
it's available on every Mac computer.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,900
We will start by turning voice over on.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,300
The great thing is that because
it's a built-in software,

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,500
there is a global shortcut key which is
available to users to use at any point.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,270
To turn a voice over on,
we press Cmd+F5.

9
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,760
And we will use the same
shortcut to turn it off.

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,840
So let's start by turning voice over on.

11
00:00:40,972 --> 00:00:45,120
>> Voice over on Chrome, Google, window,
Google, HTML content has keyboard focus.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,160
>> You can refer to instructor notes for
a full list of available shortcut keys.

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,610
The next thing I would like to do is
to setup voice over for my needs.

14
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,070
I would like to open
voice over control panel.

15
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,920
>> Spotlight spotlight system dialogue.

16
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,610
They are voice over utility from Chrome,

17
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,580
Google voice over utility
voice over utility window.

18
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,810
>> I want to show you how to
adjust speech rate for voice over.

19
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,710
First I'll show the speed that I
normally use in my daily computing

20
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,270
tasks and then we'll switch
back to the normal speech rate.

21
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,760
>> Verbosity speech leaving table and
your speech.

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,260
And Alex default for
five content selected.

23
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:34,342
Default rate at a tax default rate 50%,
60%, 65%, 70%, 75%.

24
00:01:34,342 --> 00:01:36,210
>> So this is my speech rate,

25
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,730
however most people when they hear
it they say it's too difficult for

26
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,370
them to understand because
the voices speaking just too fast.

27
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,950
So to make things a little
bit easier on you

28
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,195
I'm going to switch back
to the default speech rate.

29
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,701
>> 55, 50%, 45%.

30
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,490
>> The next setting I want to change
is the setting that's responsible for

31
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,990
providing the summary of
a web page when it loads.

32
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,765
In order to do that,
I will switch to the Web category.

33
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:08,160
Notice one thing,

34
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,030
that as I navigate through the list of
categories, I use keyboard exclusively.

35
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,980
So in this instance I'm
just going to shift tab.

36
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,510
>> Four, five.

37
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,420
Alex the mute speech unchecked checkbox
voices, utility categories, table.

38
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,790
>> Once original list, I'm going
to arrow down to the web category.

39
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,660
>> Navigation web.

40
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,240
>> And then tab again to
the set in there I want.

41
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,010
>> Leading cell navigation page
loading tab selected page loading

42
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,110
speed web page summary when
loading a new web page.

43
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,340
>> So this is the setting that I want.

44
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,890
So I'm going to check it.

45
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,210
>> Checked speed web page summary
when loading a new web page.

46
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,410
Checkbox.

47
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,420
>> And now I'm ready to go back
to Chrome and begin web browsing.

48
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,210
>> Chrome Google window.

49
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,330
Google HTML content.

50
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,480
>> So now we're going to go and
actually browse the web.

51
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,200
I would like to go to Wikipedia website.

52
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,300
So in order to do that
I'll press command l.

53
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,840
>> Open location https//
>> Which takes me to the address bar.

54
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,400
>> Selection n period en, i, k, i, p,
a, period, g, google, HTML content,

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,070
Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
page has 351 links, 15 headings.

56
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,555
4 form controls, 6 tables, 14 landmarks.

57
00:03:20,555 --> 00:03:23,351
[SOUND]
>> You notice how voice over spoke

58
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:24,670
the page summary?

59
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:29,820
It told me how many headings, links, and
form fields and tables are on that page.

60
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,360
And that's the setting we turned on
just a minute ago, if you remember.

61
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,500
Every time I start
browsing a new web page or

62
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,180
even the pages that I already
know about I start looking for

63
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,280
headings to make it easier for
me to navigate through the page.

64
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,520
Voice Over has a tool called
web router which allows me to

65
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,700
see how many headings
browse through them,

66
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,640
and choose the ones that I actually
would like to navigate to.

67
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,660
To start web router,
I press control option U

68
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,960
headings menu as you can see there are
quite a number of headings on this page.

69
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,260
So when the arrow up and

70
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,460
down I would hear things like having
level two from today's featured article

71
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,745
heading level did you know
Heading level two in the news.

72
00:04:17,745 --> 00:04:19,855
Heading level two on this day.

73
00:04:19,855 --> 00:04:23,955
>> One thing to notice here is that
the order in which I see headings with

74
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:26,965
voiceover is different from the order
you see them on the web page.

75
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:31,010
In other words,
my order is more logical.

76
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,340
And the order you see on the page
is more visually arranged.

77
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,750
This is the decision that
Wikipedia authors have made.

78
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,490
Another thing to notice here is that
voiceover speaks the heading level

79
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,730
number every time I arrow
to a particular heading.

80
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,390
>> Heading.
Heading.

81
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,250
Hea. Hea. Heading-
>> Selecting

82
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:50,950
heading level 2--
>> Level 2.

83
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,560
Wikipedia languages.

84
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,110
Heading level 2.

85
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,960
Heading.
Hea.

86
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,015
Heading level 3 print/export.

87
00:04:55,015 --> 00:04:57,780
>> 3
>> And there could be more.

88
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,970
Level of the heading indicates how
prominent it is on the web page.

89
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,770
So for example these sections here.

90
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,520
>> Padding level two
today's featured pictured.

91
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,270
>> They have higher importance than the.

92
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,490
>> Heading level three.

93
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,610
>> Think of it as sections and
subsections of a web page.

94
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,880
So if we find a heading of level three
Underneath the heading of level 2,

95
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,640
it indicates that this is a subsection
of a section of a web page.

96
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:31,240
So I would like to search for a heading
that says something about Featured.

97
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,010
So what I'm going to do is I'll
just type a few letters and

98
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,000
let voiceover find that heading for me.

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,470
>> Four items, three item, three items.

100
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,520
Three item heading level two
from today's featured article.

101
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,020
>> Yeah.
From today's feature article.

102
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,730
That's exactly what I wanted.

103
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,745
So I'm going to press Enter key and

104
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:53,015
jump-move the screen reader
focus straight to the Heading.

105
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:56,625
Heading level 2,
From today's featured article.

106
00:05:56,625 --> 00:06:00,015
>> You hear a voice over repeated the
heading again which means my focus is

107
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:01,075
right there.

108
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:05,578
From here on I can begin exploring
the page right underneath the heading by

109
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:09,140
pressing Ctrl+Option+Right Arrow.

110
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,520
>> Row 2 of 4 link image.

111
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,250
Jonathan Agnew in 2006, column 1 of 1.

112
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:19,720
Link, Jonathan Agnew born 4 April 1960
is an English link, cricket, cricket.

113
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,390
>> By the way, I can move by
headings on the page by pressing

114
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:29,820
shortcut keys Ctrl+Option+Cmd+H
to move forward by a heading.

115
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,552
Or control option command shift
age to move backward by heading.

116
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:36,020
>> Heading level two, did you know,
heading level two in the news.

117
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,440
Heading level two, did you know,
heading level two,

118
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,170
from today, first heading, heading level
two, from today's featured article.

119
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,080
>> This is a quick way to
navigate through a web page.

120
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,420
If I would like to move
with built in shortcut keys

121
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:57,220
directly through the content as opposed
to going through the web router options.

122
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,180
So this is how I navigate
the web page using headings.

123
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,260
There are other few tricks I use,
however I'll talk about them later.

124
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,080
It's important to remember, that once
you made the functionality of your

125
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,690
web page accessible and usable for
users of assistive technology.

126
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,350
Headings is probably one of the most
important features that you can

127
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,650
build into your web pages,
to make them more usable, for

128
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,310
screen beauty user specifically.
