00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,910
In summary, solving a design problem at one level of abstraction means dividing

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,640
it into subproblems. Solving each of the subproblems at a lower level of

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,090
abstraction and ensuring that the lower level solution, indeed,

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,530
contributes to the higher level. That is, divide and conquer.
