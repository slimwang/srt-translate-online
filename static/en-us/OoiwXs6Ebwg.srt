1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And you can really see this in the results.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So, this is the vertical mask applied to finding horizontal edges.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
These edges [s/l flare or throw] out really strongly.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This one is nearly invisible.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Compare this to the filter of vertical edges

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
where these things now light up,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but these have gone missing, and here's the original image again

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
where you'll see all the different edges.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Again, the horizontal filter finds the vertical edges,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the vertical filter finds horizontal edges.
