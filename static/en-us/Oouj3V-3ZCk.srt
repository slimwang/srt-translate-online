00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,320
Let's look at the left size of that equation more closely. We could remove an x

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,570
from the first two terms so we'd have x times x plus 5 plus 6. Is this

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,947
expression the same as this factor for it. Let's try and figure this thing out.

4
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:18,382
I'm going to have you multiply these two factors and then we'll be able to

5
00:00:18,382 --> 00:00:23,876
determine if this is the same as this. If we distribute this x, x plus 6 and the

6
00:00:23,876 --> 00:00:29,226
5 text plus 6, what will we get the boxes below? Write the product of the term

7
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:31,803
that we get from the multiplication.
