00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,154
These are our 3 answers. Fantastic work if you've figured those out. For our

2
00:00:04,154 --> 00:00:09,730
first problem we want to combine the routes of 5. So we'll have 2 square roots

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,480
of 5 minus 5 square roots of 5. When we subtract 2 minus 5 we'll get negative 3

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,548
groups of 5. For the roots of 11 we'll have 4 root 11 minus 1 root 11. Keep in

5
00:00:20,548 --> 00:00:25,271
mind that there's a 1 in front of this square root of 11. So, when we subtract

6
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:30,790
4 minus 1 we'll get positive 3 times root 11. This second one is really tricky.

7
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,874
You want to pay attention to the index of the radicals and the radicands. Here

8
00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:40,689
the index is a 2. But here the index is a 3. This means that these 2 radicals

9
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:45,590
are not like terms. We have a square root of 2 and a cubed root of 2. This

10
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,524
means that we can't add the 2 terms together which means we just list them as a

11
00:00:48,524 --> 00:00:53,732
sum. It might have been easy to make the mistake of writing 10 root 2. Or 10

12
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:58,532
times the cubed root of 2. But again, the indexes are not the same. So these

13
00:00:58,532 --> 00:01:03,450
would not be correct. For our third one, we want to combine the 5th roots of x.

14
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,392
The indexes are 5, all match. And the radicand are all x. So we have like

15
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:14,554
terms. So I have 3 plus 5 plus 1 times the 5th root of x. This would make 9

16
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:20,900
times the 5th 3 of x and our answer. This positive 3 is not like terms with

17
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,153
anything else so we just carry it on and add it to the sum in our final answer.
