Hello, my name is Adam, and I'll be your assistant instructor

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
for Introduction to Statistics.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome to our first problem set covering visualization.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's get started.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
First, I'd like to ask you about a scatterplot,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
specifically about the relationship between GPAs

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
or grade point averages in high school and college.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
GPAs are a measure of academic performance

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and range from 0 being the worst to

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
4 being the best,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
so let's look at some simulated data

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that might describe such a relationship.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
A student who received the highest GPA in both,

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
a 4 and a 4, would be right about here.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And let's fill in the rest of the points.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So looking at this relationship,

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I would like you to tell me whether the relationship

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
between high school and college

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
GPAs is linear

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and whether it is exact.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that apply.
