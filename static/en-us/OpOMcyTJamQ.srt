1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,290
For this step,
I decided to use localForage.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,300
The API is simple and easy to use, and

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,390
it takes JavaScript objects,
no need to JSONify anything.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,090
In index.html, I added a link
to the localForage script.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,228
Then in app.js, I created a
saveSelectiveCities function that saves

6
00:00:22,228 --> 00:00:28,448
the array of selective cities using
the localforage.setItem function.

7
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:33,230
I also had to update the click event
handler for the add button in the new

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,970
city dialogue to save the selective
cities when the user hits add.

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,430
To get content on screen, I called
the localforage.getItem function and

10
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,760
ask for the list of selectedCities.

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:55,680
If there is one,
I save that to app.selectedCities and

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,090
then got the forecast for
each city by iterating over the array.

13
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,941
If the user didn't have
any selected cities,

14
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:09,387
I updated the UI with
the injected weather forecast,

15
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:13,450
then save the list of
cities to the localForage.

16
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,530
I wrapped all of that in
a DOMContentLoaded event handler,

17
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,380
because I need to make sure that
local forage has been loaded

18
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,720
before I can make calls to it.

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,180
