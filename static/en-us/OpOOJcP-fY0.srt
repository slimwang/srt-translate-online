1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the correct answer is this: we'll see an error message, but the quote

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
messes up our HTML,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And let's see that happen, together.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We said the quote was going to mess up our HTML--

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
let's submit the form

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and here we go.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We've got our error message, but the string that I answered

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
was: bar">what

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and "what" appeared outside of our text box.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now it's not too tricky to see why this happened.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What happened was this string here--

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
this Python string--doesn't know it's HTML

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and when we entered in a quote

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
in our string, Python substituted a quote in the middle of here

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and then I also put an angle bracket in,

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and that closed the tag.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And then the other string that I typed appeared outside here.
