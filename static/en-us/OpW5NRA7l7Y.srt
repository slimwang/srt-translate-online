00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,290
First you need to get it
working on your local machine.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,710
All of the commands I use here
are in the present as notes for

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,109
you to run yourself or
even copy and paste.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,540
But before you run them, you'll need to
install Node.js as all the server and

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,850
build scripts are written in JavaScript.

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,750
Once that's installed,
clone the project from GitHub.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,800
This will download it all
to your local machine.

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,260
If you're new to Git and

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,050
want to learn more,
there's a whole Udacity course on it.

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,020
So if you're already
bored of my face and

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,190
voice, you could do that course instead.

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,120
I've linked to it in
the instructor notes.

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,750
But you don't need to be one of
the Git elite for this course.

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,760
We'll give you all the commands
you need along the way.
