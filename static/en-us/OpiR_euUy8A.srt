1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,810
There's a pattern here, isn't there?

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:05,160
Almost every website follows some type of grid structure.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,900
But where's the grid structure coming from?

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,260
As it turns out, CSS allows us to control how wide our elements are and

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,790
how they're arranged on the page.

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,760
But this should be a pretty easy task, right?

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,580
Once we know what kind of grid we want, we should pretty easily be able to

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,420
just snap elements to the right points in the grid.

9
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,530
Looking back at the Udacity course's page,

10
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,990
we've got all of these classes listed on the right side of the screen.

11
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,003
We've got options for

12
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:29,780
making sure that they all fit within this column on the right.

13
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,435
Either, we could go into each class here and style its HTML and

14
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:38,670
CSS individually to make sure that they all fit on the right side of the screen.

15
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,660
Or we could create some kind of general CSS classes that define the styles that

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,300
we need to keep all the courses in the right column.

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,270
In fact, creating CSS classes that control layout is considered the best

18
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,550
practice today.

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,990
And we call these sets of classes Frameworks.

20
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,930
Let's dive deeper into what Frameworks need to do.
