1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,270
That ends the, the,
the basic discussion about.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,500
It was actually done for stereo reasons
which is kind of funny because in stereo

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,990
you know that points have to
move along the epipolar line.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,760
Whereas in motion they can move
however they happen to move.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,800
But it was originally derived
in a stereo formulation.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,140
It's actually used a lot more now in
the whole process of, of doing motion.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,800
To actually make work, you, you're going
to have to do things hierarchically,

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,860
that is, you are going to do
things at a core scale and

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,270
then get to a finer scale and
a finer scale.

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,840
And, it's a really good example of doing
multiscale processing on images, and

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,740
that's actually why we're
going to do it next time
