1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,370
This systematized nomenclature of
medicine SNOMED and SNOMED-CT,

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:12,170
a subset for clinical medicine, began in
NIH and was recently just for pathology.

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,120
Interestingly, the original objective
back in the 70s was machine coding

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,420
of a pathologist's free
text dictated note.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,190
It was always in ontology representing
relationships among its concepts.

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,520
Today it has expanded to all of
medicine, and is maintained by

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,940
the International Health Terminology
Standards Development Organization.

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,330
SNOMED is huge and complex.

9
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,226
Even the SNOMED-CT subset
has 311,000 concepts.

10
00:00:41,226 --> 00:00:46,590
And represents 1.3 million
relationships among them.

11
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,910
Concepts are a basic component of
SNOMED-CT and have clinical meaning.

12
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,288
They're identified by a unique
nine digit numeric concept ID and

13
00:00:56,288 --> 00:01:01,120
a unique human-readable
fully specified name.

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,880
Concepts can be represented as
a hierarchy based on level of detail

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,810
as shown here where we go

16
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,970
at least detail from the concept of
a procedure at some site of the body

17
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:19,790
all the way to a very specific procedure
done at a very specific location.

18
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,500
This illustration shows other
basic components of SNOMED-CT.

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,840
Relationship links, which are expressed
using is a, and attribute relationships,

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,250
which are a finding site or
an associated morphology.

21
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,880
So a fracture of the tarsal bone,
is a sub type of a fracture of the foot.

22
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,850
The tarsal bone is part of the foot,
and has a finding site, and

23
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,400
an associated morphology,
the location of the fracture and

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,900
the fact that it is in fact a fracture.

25
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,630
The ability of SNOMED to
represent medicine and

26
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,650
medical concepts is illustrated here,
where we see that the patient has

27
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:04,590
a particular condition, Acute
Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis,

28
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,800
a condition I actually
had as a teenager.

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,417
It's caused by group
A Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus,

30
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:16,562
which is an organism that
affects a body structure,

31
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:21,760
the kidneys, and it's a clinical
finding or a medical problem.

32
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,080
Using this hierarchy a computer
could recognize these relationships.

33
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:33,100
This is actually a simple example
showing only three of the 18

34
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,620
top level components in the SNOMED
hierarchy, Body Structure,

35
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,470
Clinical Finding, and Organism.
