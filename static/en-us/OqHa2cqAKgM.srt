1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,340
To start off, I created variables for article two and article three.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,110
Article two got set equal to this jQuery selector for the class featured, and

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,480
then I set article three to the next sibling of article two.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,890
Then, all I did was toggle the class of featured on article two and

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,190
article three.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:20,920
I hit Test Run.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,970
And, let's see how it looks.

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,451
We can see that now article three has a blue background while article two

9
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:26,980
does not.

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,090
Looks like it worked.

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,140
This shows that toggleClass will either add or

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,200
remove a class depending on whether or not it's already there.
