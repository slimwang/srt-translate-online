1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,610
Another property of our imaging systems is field of view, sometimes called zoom,

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,400
which is probably not quite right.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,330
But it's this idea of how wide of a view do we have.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,620
And I'm going to show you this in a lens that can change its focal length to

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,210
show you that the field of view is a function of the focal length.

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,300
There are lenses that can change their field of view while staying in

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,140
constant focus are called zoom lenses.

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,460
There are some lenses that you can change their focal length but

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,220
you have to refocus.

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,590
Those are actually called variable focal length lenses.

11
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,320
That's the, just the nomenclature.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,950
Here we start off with a very wide angle shot, it says 17 millimeters.

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,390
And you see this little circle up there that's, that's on that boat?

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,580
As we step through and we increase from 17 millimeter to 28, to 50,

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,890
to 85, what we're doing is we're increasing the focal length of the lens.

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,690
Here we are at 135, 300, 500, and that's 1,000 millimeters.

17
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:00,150
So we've gone from a focal length of 17 millimeters to 1,000 millimeters,

18
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:06,160
it's a ratio of greater than 50 to 1, and there's that guy on the boat, right.

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,190
Same boat back here, all right.

20
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:08,844
There he is.

21
00:01:08,844 --> 00:01:10,930
Okay, so that's incredible zooming.

22
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,100
So you think they used a tripod?

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,210
Well of course they did, right?

24
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,640
In fact, this is something you might think about if you haven't thought, right?

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,540
Let's assume for a moment that your hands shake just a little and

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,670
they cause a small amount of angular deflection.

27
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,180
Well if my image is looking at something this wide,

28
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,850
then a small amount of angular deflection doesn't move my pixels very much.

29
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,580
But suppose my angle of view is, you know, a degree or just a couple degrees.

30
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,190
Well, then a small amount of of angular shift of

31
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,230
my hands is going to move the pixels a lot.

32
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,240
And that's why the longer the focal length,

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,200
the more you have to stabilize your image.

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,620
And that's why for really nice zoomed out lenses you have to have a tripod.

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,170
It's not just because they're heavy.

36
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,130
It's because you need to have things be perfectly still.

37
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,110
Now we can compute the field of view.

38
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,430
And the field of view actually depends upon two things.

39
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,920
One we already know, right?

40
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,850
We know that it depends upon the focal length.

41
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,050
But it's also going to be a function of, sort of,

42
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:11,560
how big is the light sensitive element?

43
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,370
So here calling d the size of the retina, okay?

44
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,320
So the retina is the thing in the back of your eye that senses light.

45
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,810
Just think of it as the light sensitive medium.

46
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,200
So, so d is this whole size, okay.

47
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,980
Here's f r focal length, and clearly sort of half of d over f,

48
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,780
well, the angle who's the arctan of that, the angle that that's the tangent,

49
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,420
that's going to be this angle phi here, which is half the field of view.

50
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,050
So basically, the bottom line is, the longer the focal length,

51
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,780
the smaller the field of view.

52
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,880
The bigger the, the imaging surface, the bigger the, the field of view.

53
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,420
In fact what's sometimes called medium format photography, instead of using tiny

54
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,700
little sensors, they use much bigger sensors so they can put, still a lot of

55
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,120
pixels, but over a much bigger area, that gives it much wider fields of view.
