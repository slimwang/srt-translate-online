1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,270
Let's take a quick look
at the layout of the app.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,100
Here are the Java classes.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,510
The Dinner class has methods for
figuring out what dinner to suggest.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,990
The MainActivity shows the main screen.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,360
To start with the main screen only has
this one button, What's for dinner?

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,760
And when you press the button
it fires off an intent

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,088
to the show dinner activity.

8
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:26,300
So the dinner shows here and
then you get these buttons.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,790
And each of these buttons fires off
an intent to start the appropriate

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,670
activity.

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,390
So for example,

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,470
the Show Recipe button sends an intent
to start the show recipe activity.

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,740
And actually, Choose Again does
not have a corresponding activity,

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,020
it just has a method inside the class.

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,170
Now this class here,
the useInfoBoxFragment

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,760
is a fragment that simply displays
an info box and a heading.

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,760
This lets you reuse the fragment
wherever you need it, and

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,400
helps simplify the code.

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,260
And for example, the showRecipeActivity,
the removeMealActivity,

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,410
the orderDinnerActivity,
all these activities use this fragment.

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,200
And the app has a couple of menus.

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,500
There's the main menu,
which just shows the settings.

23
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,980
But actually, we're not going to use
the settings in this application.

24
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,720
More interestingly, the food prefs menu,
displays a list of food options.

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,010
This pop-up is used whenever we want
the user, choose the food preference.

26
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,840
There's one other quick
thing I want to mention.

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,450
In the intro lesson to this
course you learned how to

28
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,250
implement the unconnected code to
use the Google API Client Library.

29
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,790
However, for both Google Analytics and
Google Tag Manager,

30
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:42,540
you do not need to implement any code
to use the Google API Client Library.

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,040
All the app needs is to specify
the version of the client library

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,540
in the android manifest, like this.

33
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:55,030
And to specify the dependency on
play-services in the build.gradle file.

34
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,560
And these dependencies have already
been set up for you in the What's For

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,370
Dinner sample app.
