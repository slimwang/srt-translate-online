1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,335
So, let's look at the solution to our

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:06,954
MOVZ/MOVN QUIZ. We have this code. And we want

3
00:00:06,954 --> 00:00:09,234
to do if conversion of it, so that we

4
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:13,010
get a branch-free code that does the same work.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,530
If conversion amounts to doing the work of

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,590
both paths, both the not-taken and the taken paths.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,270
And then selecting between the two and correcting the

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,360
results so that only one of them is active.

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,520
So, what we have done is, these two

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,328
instructions are already doing the work of the

11
00:00:31,328 --> 00:00:35,239
not-taken path. Is just that instead of in

12
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:39,956
R2, which would permanently modify R2, we're putting the

13
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:45,830
result in R4 and here the taken path R3 and 1 are added, then we put the result

14
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:51,640
in R5 instead of R3. So what now needs to happen is, if this was

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,622
the correct path to take, then R2 should get the result

16
00:00:56,622 --> 00:01:01,610
of R4. Otherwise, R3 should get the result from R5.

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:09,500
This is a branch on equal 0, R1. So

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,080
if R1 is not equal 0, meaning

19
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:24,690
MOVN on R1 used as a condition. We're going to be moving R4 into R2.

20
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,098
If the branch is branching, then R1 is zero, and in that case

21
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:37,130
we want to be moving R5 into R3. And this is our if converted

22
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:42,280
code that has four instructions worth of work, but no branches in them.

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,416
In contrast, the original code has three instructions

24
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:50,200
worth of work, in this path, and two instructions

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,150
worth of work in this path. But, it

26
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,320
has this branch that might be difficult to predict.
