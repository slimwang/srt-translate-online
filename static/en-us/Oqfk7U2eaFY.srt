00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,890
We have seen that the processor can improve performance a lot, barely ordering

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,070
instructions. But things are not that rosy in the instruction reorder land.

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,602
In real programs we can have exceptions. Such as divide by 0, that can be messed

00:00:14,602 --> 00:00:19,870
up if we don't execute instructions exactly in program order. This lesson

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:25,020
explains how to clean up the reordering mess when exceptions do happen
