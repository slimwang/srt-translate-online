1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,700
People have been doing derivatives and edges for a very long time.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:08,530
The most classic one is referred to as a Sobel operator, named after Leonard.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,840
I have no idea.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,730
It's named after some guy named Sobel.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,510
And the Sobel operator looks just like what I was showing you.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,270
But instead of one-half and

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,610
minus one-half, it's got this weird thing where it's doing these eighths.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,080
And you can see that it does, not only plus 2 minus 2,

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,160
which you would then divide by 4 and you get the same value.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,620
But it also does a plus 1 minus 1 on the row above me,

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,300
and a plus 1 minus 1 on the row below me.

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,160
And the idea here is, that if I'm taking a derivative.

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,350
Remember how we said before we assume that our images are sort of

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,180
locally this smooth, that is they change similarly?

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,080
So the idea here is that if I'm going to compute a derivative at a pixel,

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,090
I won't look just left, right at me, but also look nearby me.

17
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,010
And then to normalize this thing, you have to divide it by 8.

18
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,050
By the way, having just finished,

19
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,960
almost finished teaching the course here on campus, we had a problem set where

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,150
people were having a heck of a time that they hadn't had a problem with before.

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,870
Turned out,

22
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,040
somebody had discovered that MATLAB has a built in function called imgradientxy.

23
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,290
And they said, could we use that function to compute the gradient?

24
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,960
Since it was for part of a problem set that was more advanced and

25
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,790
they had already done gradients, I said sure.

26
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,860
And all the sudden people are having all sorts of problems.

27
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,290
And the reason was, if you look up imgradient,

28
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,990
it tells you that it applies the Sobel operator by default.

29
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,190
Well here's the Sobel operator.

30
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,690
Looks great, but you know what?

31
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,905
It doesn't divide by 8.

32
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,260
So all their gradients were scaled by a factor of 8 and

33
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,190
it totally screwed up the entire class.

34
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,560
A hundred people got screwed up because of this.

35
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,100
So, now we tell them you can use im gradient, but you better divide by 8.

36
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,850
Oh, by the way,

37
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,840
the y one is here as well, and in this case y is positive going up.

38
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,290
Remember, it can go in either direction.

39
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,890
Alright, so the Sobel gradient would just be made up

40
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:08,600
of the application of this sx and sy to get you these values.

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,360
And the magnitude is just the square root of the sum of the squares.

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,100
I should have said that gx is the application of sx,

43
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,450
gy is the application of sy.

44
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,740
So the magnitude is just what we did before.

45
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,910
And here is the arctan2,

46
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,590
the atan2 that we were talking about in order to get the gradient.

47
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,320
So here's an ancient example.

48
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,940
It's so ancient I know because that's X Windows, so

49
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,550
that even predates when most of you were born.

50
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,340
And here you have a picture on the left that's an image.

51
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,240
Here is a gradient magnitude, so

52
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,440
you just apply the Sobel Operator, take the sum of the squares, square root of.

53
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,470
And then by the way you could just threshold it.

54
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,470
And you'll notice two things.

55
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,680
One, it's not an awful edge image and two, it's not a great edge image.

56
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,840
All right?

57
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,780
So we're like part way there.

58
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,380
We're partly towards getting that done.
