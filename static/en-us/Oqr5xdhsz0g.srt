00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,980
So, while adding these two buttons, some students had trouble while playing and

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,270
stopping audio.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,500
I want to address those concerns in this video.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,740
Now, here in my Play Sounds View Controller, I have actions for

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,379
play slow audio, play fast audio, and stop audio.

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,280
I'm going to run this project and see if it works.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,740
Here, I will play the move quote slowly, and then fast, and

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,280
then I will stop all audio.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:32,762
Take a listen [SOUND].

10
00:00:32,762 --> 00:00:36,485
Now you may have noticed that when I press any one of these two buttons while

11
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:40,389
the audio is already playing, the playback starts not from the beginning but

12
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:43,750
from when I actually pressed any one of these two buttons.

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,930
You can keep that functionality, if you'd like.

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,540
Although, if you want to start the audio from the beginning.

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,050
You can use this property called currentTime and set it to 0.0.

16
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,530
Let me do that in both slow and fast.

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,490
Okay, let me run this project one more time.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,500
Now, this time the audio will start from the beginning.

19
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,480
>> My mom always said.

20
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,010
My momma always said, life was like a box of chocolates.

21
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,900
>> Cool.

22
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,910
Now one final thing to notice here is that the code for

23
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,250
both the slow and the fast actions is looking really similar to each other.

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,730
Here is an opportunity for you to put the common code in a new function.

25
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,620
And then call that new function from both the Play Slow Audio and

26
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,530
the Play Fast Audio actions.

27
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,530
All right, if you have any more questions about how to make these two

28
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,320
buttons work, ask those questions in the discussion forum, we are here to help
