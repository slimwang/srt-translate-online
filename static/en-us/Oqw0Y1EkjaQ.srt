00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,080
Now that we have this book object and we've tested it, let's put it to use.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,679
You're going to write a program that takes a user input word, and tells how

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,284
many times it occurs. Your code will be able to do this. When you're done with

4
00:00:13,284 --> 00:00:16,795
this you'll be able to run look up any word. It'll ask you to type a word and

5
00:00:16,795 --> 00:00:22,138
it'll look it up. So, I'll type Hatter and press Enter. And it tells me Hatter

6
00:00:22,138 --> 00:00:27,580
occurs 55 times. I'm going to give you some pointers. You'll want to make a new

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,079
book, like we do in BookTester. You'll also need to use a scanner, don't forget

8
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,833
the import. Also, you saw how to read and enter a double, but you didn't see

9
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:39,430
how to read a string with the scanner. You'll need to look at the scanner

10
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,820
documentation. Scanner has a lot of methods, you'll want to use one of the ones

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,840
that starts with next and returns a string. If picking the right scanner method

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,140
makes your head hurt, click the link that says hints. I'll go over this part in

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,360
detail in the answer video.
