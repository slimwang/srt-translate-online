00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Norvig] Now I want to talk about 1 more representation for planning

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
called situation calculus.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
To motivate this, suppose we wanted to have the goal of moving all the cargo

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
from airport A to airport B, regardless of how many pieces of cargo there are.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You can't express the notion of All in propositional languages like classical planning,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but you can in first order logic.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There are several ways to use first order logic for planning.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The best known is situation calculus.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's not a new kind of logic;

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
rather, it's regular first order logic with a set of conventions

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
for how to represent states and actions.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'll show you what the conventions are.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
First, actions are represented as objects in first order logic,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
normally by functions.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And so we would have a function like the function Fly

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
of a plane and a From Airport and a To Airport

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
which represents an object, which is the action.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then we have situations, and situations are also objects in the logic,

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and they correspond not to states but rather to paths--

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
the paths of actions that we have in state space search.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So if you arrive at what would be the same world state by 2 different sets of actions,

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
those would be considered 2 different situations in situation calculus.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We describe the situations by objects, so we usually have an initial situation,

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
often called S0,

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and then we have a function on situations called Result.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So the result of a situation object and an action object is equal to another situation.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And now instead of describing the actions that are applicable

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
in a situation with a predicate Actions of S,

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
situation calculus for some reason decided not to do that

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and instead we're going to talk about the actions that are possible in the state,

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and we're going to do that with a predicate.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If we have a predicate Possible of A and S, is an action A possible in a state?

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There's a specific form for describing these predicates,

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and in general, it has the form of some precondition of state S

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
implies that it's possible to do action A in state S.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll show you the possibility axiom for the Fly action.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We would say if there is some P, which is the plane in state S,

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and there is some X, which is an airport in state S,

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and there is some Y, which is also an airport in state S,

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and P is at location X in state S,

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:41,000
then that implies that it's possible to fly P from X to Y in state S.

42
00:03:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And that's known as the possibility axiom for the action Fly.
