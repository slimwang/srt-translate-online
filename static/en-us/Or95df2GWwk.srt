Here is my hand and as I draw my fingers, I find that I have 5 fingers on my hand.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Please check your hands, I bet in all likelihood, each of your hands has 5 fingers, but not always.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So if we go and measure the number of fingers that people have on the left hand, you'll probably find

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that almost everybody has 5 fingers, and in all honesty, there is the rare case of a person

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
who has fewer fingers, like 4 or 3, but that's really rare.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So if we look at that sequence, we have 20 hands, 19 of which have 5 fingers.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So what do you think now is the average number of fingers for this specific data sequence.

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
