00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,830
Congratulations on
completing this course.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,689
At this point, you've deployed
Hadoop clusters manually,

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:10,151
automatically with and on demand
with Amazon's Elastic MapReduce.

4
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:14,380
From here, I suggest looking into
the vast configuration options.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,730
Things like adjusting the block size,
the number of mappers and reducers, and

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,679
compressing the mapper output can make
your jobs run much more efficiently.

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,490
I'll give you some links to
information on these configurations.

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,730
Now you're ready to
tackle big data projects.
