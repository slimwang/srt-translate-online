1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,274
So this example that we, you know, created just

2
00:00:03,274 --> 00:00:07,218
at random actually is it computes an interesting function. So

3
00:00:07,218 --> 00:00:10,830
let's, let's focus on just the case where our X1

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,266
is in the set zero, one and X2 is in

5
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:16,181
the set zero, one. So those are the only inputs

6
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:19,106
that we care about, combinations of those. What is Y

7
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:22,580
computing here? What is the name of that relationship that

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,520
function that's being computed? And so, just as a hint,

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,910
there's a, there's a, there's a nice short one-word answer to this if

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,250
you can kind of plug it through and see what it is that it's computing.
