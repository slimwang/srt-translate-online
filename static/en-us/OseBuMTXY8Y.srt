00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:00,920
Okay, while J.P.

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,790
was talking to you, I found out how we
could perform searches in Firebase.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,000
Here's an example statement
that I want you to look at.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,830
What this code does is it returns all
the lists names that start with do.

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,830
Let's break this statement apart.

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,590
Ref is a Firebase location,

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,850
in this case it's a reference to
all the shopping lists of a user.

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,360
Next, you need to order
the objects in that location

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,960
by whatever property
you want to search on.

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,498
In this case we're searching
on the property list name.

11
00:00:23,498 --> 00:00:24,760
If you want to search through values or

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,260
keys you can order by
those constraints as well.

13
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,232
And then we have this startAt ednAt.

14
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:31,992
The startAt says begin with
all words that start with do.

15
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:35,413
Remember, startAt is inclusive so there
could be a list name that's just do and

16
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:38,084
that would be included in
the results returned by this query.

17
00:00:38,084 --> 00:00:41,088
Okay, so we're starting our
words that begin with do and

18
00:00:41,088 --> 00:00:44,353
we're ending at words that begin
with do and then this tilde.

19
00:00:44,353 --> 00:00:45,955
So what's the purpose of this tilde?

20
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:48,754
Well the tilde has the special
characteristic of being one of the last

21
00:00:48,754 --> 00:00:50,600
characters of the ASCII alphabet.

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,300
All right, now they give a little bit
more of an idea of what this is actually

23
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,630
saying let's see what
it does in practice.

24
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,050
Let's say that I have a user with
these lists in their user lists.

25
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,140
Ref here would be
referring to these lists.

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,060
Now these are currently ordered by
the time which the user saves them, but

27
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,880
we're going to do an order by
childless name which will sort them

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,910
by their lists name.

29
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,350
So, here are the sort of lists,

30
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,620
notice how the space here comes before
all the characters in the alphabet.

31
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,570
So do space comes before don.

32
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,920
So I've done these two commands
now I'm going to startAt do.

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,530
And what that means is I skip over
things that start with da and

34
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,720
di and
I start at this one that starts with do.

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,370
I ended do told again tilde,

36
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,400
again tilde is character that comes
after all of the other characters.

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,790
It's kind of like saying endeAt doz, but

38
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,770
tilde actually comes after Z as well
as punctuation in the ASCII alphabet.

39
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,810
So I'm trying to find things
that fall between these two.

40
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,490
Do not delete this
list as one such thing.

41
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,240
The space character comes before
the tilde character so it's included.

42
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,350
Same thing with donut run.

43
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,810
Don comes after do, and don and comes
before do~ because n is before tilda.

44
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,230
Similarly with donut run, donut run
would come after the string DO, but,

45
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,760
before the strike DO [INAUDIBLE],
because you is before told them.

46
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,610
Dpans misspelled list, on the other
hand, does not start with do.

47
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,230
It starts with DP,
which comes after do, so

48
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,420
it would not be included in this range.

49
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,500
So this is what we end up with.

50
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,280
And these are the lists here
that are returned by this query,

51
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,120
which happen to be all
the lists that start with do.

52
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,590
Hopefully that makes some sense, but

53
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,660
I've got a couple questions just to
make sure that you're following.

54
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,140
Okay, so here's the same list of
shopping lists, and I've gone ahead and

55
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,000
put them in order for you.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,920
And here are two queries that
are similar to the query that I just

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,280
showed you, but with something
a little different in each.

58
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,770
This one doesn't include the endAt and
this ends at doZ.

59
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,500
Note that this is a capital Z and
it actually does matter.

60
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,990
Given this query, check off
the lists that would be returned.

61
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,222
Similarly, given this query check
off a list that would be returned.

62
00:02:42,222 --> 00:02:43,510
This one's a little bit more tricky so

63
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,190
I highly suggest that you check out
the ordering of the ASCII alphabet

64
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,320
before answering.

65
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,390
I've included it in the instructor
notes below if you need it.
