00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,432
Now it's about time to compute the derivative of the exponential function.

2
00:00:04,433 --> 00:00:11,266
We already know one value--the derivative of the exponential function at X equals zero is one,

3
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:16,966
because the slope of the tangent line is one, which was our definition of the exponential function.

4
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:21,399
Everything else can be derived from that, with the help of this equation.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:30,632
E to the power of X plus H equals E to the power of X times E to the power of H.

6
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:38,299
This looks rather simple, but this is the key to compute the derivative for every X.

7
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:49,166
Let's say H is a number close to zero. Then E to the H describes this part of the curve of the graph,

8
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:58,232
that is, of the exponential function. E to the power of X plus H describes some other part of that graph.

9
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:02,232
One that's centered around the value of X.

10
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:12,866
Now, this equation tells us that we can use the green part of that graph, magnify it by E to the power of X,

11
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:22,932
and get the red part of that graph. Of course, the same thing would happen to the slope triangle here,

12
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:28,699
which means the slope increases by a factor of E to the power of X.

13
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:36,799
We do know that the slope at the origin is one, so this slope has to be E to the power of X times one.

14
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,466
It's the exponential function itself again.

15
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:49,766
This is a fundamental result. The derivative of E to the power of X with respect to X equals E to the power of X.

16
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:56,500
The exponential function--the exponential function, I should be saying, is its own derivative.
