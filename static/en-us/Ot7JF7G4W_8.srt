1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We have two dice.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
One has 6 sides and one has 8 sides.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We select which die to roll based on whether the flip of this coin is heads,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
in which case was roll the 6-sided die,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
or tails, in which case we roll the 8-sided die.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What is the probability of rolling a 6?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You can assume that the coins and dice are fair.
