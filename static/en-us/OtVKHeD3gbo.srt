1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,630
So imagine that your robot has
this in its knowledge base and

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,020
goes into a country where
it finds an animal and

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,490
from its perspective knows that this
animal has wings and does not have fur.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,760
So these two additional centers
is gotten in the knowledge base.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,160
Now the robot wants to
prove that this is a bird.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,230
In order to [INAUDIBLE] proving,

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,710
what should the robot begin
by writing in this box?

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,310
What should the S4 sentence be?
