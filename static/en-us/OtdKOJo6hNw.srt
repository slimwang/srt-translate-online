00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,968
Before we move on to
the JavaScript language itself,

2
00:00:02,968 --> 00:00:05,919
how about we recap some of
the things you just learned?

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,699
First, you learned that all major
browsers come with built-in JavaScript

4
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:10,240
engines.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,625
This allows browsers to run and
execute JavaScript code.

6
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:16,649
>> Next, you got practice
using the JavaScript console.

7
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,949
The JavaScript console allows
you to print strings and

8
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:22,980
execute lines of JavaScript code on
the fly, right inside of your browser.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,710
>> And finally, you wrap up with some
exercises where you use JavaScript

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,929
to add styles and
animations to a web page.

11
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,519
>> Hopefully, you're beginning
to see the power of JavaScript.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,140
And you're ready to dive in and
explore the language.

13
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,130
See you in the next lesson.
