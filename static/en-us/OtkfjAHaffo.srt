00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,344
Now things are changing for your project, and for Andy's too.

2
00:00:03,344 --> 00:00:08,388
[SOUND] I've got Andy on speed dial, number four.

3
00:00:08,388 --> 00:00:11,320
Hey Andy can you come down to my desk for a second?

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:11,965
Great, thanks.

5
00:00:11,965 --> 00:00:12,776
[SOUND] Now,

6
00:00:12,776 --> 00:00:17,817
the project manager has changed the requirements in two different ways.

7
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,210
First of all, there's not one cat anymore.

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,920
Now there are two cats.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,900
Second of all, the cat name should be above the cat image.

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,880
So how you implement that is completely up to you, but

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,200
I would recommend avoiding the most naive of solutions.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,880
Don't just hardcode the cat name and the dom, or in the document.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,560
Instead, store that in a JavaScript variable, and then update the document.

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,190
Hey Andy.

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,050
>> Hey, what's up?

16
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,019
>> So the project requirements have changed.

17
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:46,720
>> Okay.

18
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,520
Cat clicker duo.

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,940
>> Ooh, let me guess.

20
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,740
Two cats?

21
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,350
>> Two cats.

22
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,290
Can you do it?

23
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,430
>> I didn't plan for that, but I think I could probably figure it out.

24
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:56,930
>> Awesome.
