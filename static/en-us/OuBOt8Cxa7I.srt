00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,320
In this lesson, we will learn about switching

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,810
and bridging. In particular, we will learn about how

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,990
hosts find each other on a subnet and

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,520
how subnets are interconnected. We will also learn about

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,700
the difference between switches and hubs, and the

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,710
difference between switches and routers. And we'll talk about

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,440
the scaling problems with Ethernet. And mechanisms that

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,150
can be used to allow it to scale better.
