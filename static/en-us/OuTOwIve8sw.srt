00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,980
In the case of multiplying a binomial by a trinomial, we just want to add some

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,310
rectangles so we can complete our multiplication. Just like with these numbers,

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,031
I'm going to set up a rectangle, and then I'm going to label each factor along

4
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:16,020
the side of the rectangle. This one will be x plus 3, and this one will be x

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,262
squared plus 2x plus 3. Using what you know about multiplication, I want you to

6
00:00:20,262 --> 00:00:23,835
figure out the area of each of these rectangles. What would they be?
