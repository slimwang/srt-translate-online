1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,490
We can summarize the means-ends analysis method like this.

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,030
Compare the current state and

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,230
the goal state. Find the differences between them. For each difference,

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,370
look at what operators might be applicable. Select that operator that gets you

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,449
closest to the goal state from the current state. We did this for the blocks and

6
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:23,212
worlds problem. We also did this with regards to the business problem. But

7
00:00:23,212 --> 00:00:26,534
throughout those states in regards to business problem, which we're not getting

8
00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:30,810
us close to the goal state. This is the means-ends analysis method in summary.
