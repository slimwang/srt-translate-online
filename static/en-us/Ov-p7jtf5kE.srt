00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's look at the answer
to our inclusion quiz.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,260
If the two caches do
maintain inclusion property,

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:11,010
the block that was in L1
still is in L2 as well.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,190
So when we want to write it back,
it will be a level two hit and

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,980
it cannot be a level two miss
because inclusion guarantees that,

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,290
that block still exists in L2.

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,840
After we do the write back, we can
try to bring the new block into L1.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,280
And that may replace this
block from both L1 and L2.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,170
But until it's written back,
it's a block that exists in L1.

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,708
So it also is in L2.

11
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,220
Thus the write back is a hit.

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,960
In contrast, if we make no
attempt to maintain inclusion

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,450
when a dirty block is replaced
from the level one cache.

14
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,660
That block may or may not be in
the level two cache as well.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,950
So we may have a write back
be a level two right hit or

16
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,208
if the block is not in L2
anymore it will be a miss.

17
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:04,560
So write back handling
becomes slightly easier if

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,770
you do maintain the inclusion property.
