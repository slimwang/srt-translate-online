00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,980
Interviewing for
a machine learning engineer position

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,740
can be quite intimidating but
also incredibly exciting.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,210
The company you're trying to join might
be at the forefront of innovation

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,280
in healthcare, education,
robotics, or user modeling.

5
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,109
Whatever the domain, in order to
be successful at machine learning

6
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:21,359
you need to have a strong
problem solving mindset.

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,419
You should be able to take almost any
business challenge presented to you,

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,160
break it down, and figure out how to
apply machine learning to solve it.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,939
The concepts and skills that you may
need to demonstrate in an interview

10
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:38,629
include Computer Science Fundamentals &
Programming Techniques, Probability and

11
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,890
Statistics, Data Modeling and

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,429
Evaluation, Applying Machine Learning
Algorithms and Libraries, and

13
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:50,039
finally, you also need to know about
Software Engineering & System Design.

14
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,429
Take a look at the machine learning
interview guide for detailed topics and

15
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,200
some sample questions.

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,580
