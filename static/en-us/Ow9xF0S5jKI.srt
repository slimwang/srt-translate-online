1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,727
In the last two examples,
you saw subnet masks for a /24 and

2
00:00:04,727 --> 00:00:09,732
a /16 network, both of those being
multiples of 8 bits, which meant

3
00:00:09,732 --> 00:00:15,009
that the subnet mask decimal form had
only 255 octets and 0 octets in it.

4
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:18,071
But prefixes do not have
to be whole octets.

5
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:20,805
Networks can be allocated in
lots of different sizes and

6
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:24,006
organizations can split their
assigned net block into chunks for

7
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:27,550
subnets to make management easier and
control traffic.

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,970
For instance, a network with
22 bits of network part and

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,604
10 bits of host part,
still adding up to 32, is a /22 network.

10
00:00:35,604 --> 00:00:38,350
/22 doesn't evenly divided by eight.

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,298
Or here's another example,
171.64.0.0/14,

12
00:00:44,298 --> 00:00:48,047
is the net block assigned
to Stanford University.

13
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:52,520
The /14 is less than 2
octets of network part.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,791
So all of the addresses on this network
will have the same first 8 bits they'll

15
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,710
all start with 171.

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,100
Only six bits of the second
octet will be fixed and

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,400
two bits of that second
octet will be free,

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,770
meaning there are four different
values that will occur in that octet.

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,769
Specifically, all addresses
starting with 171.64 or

20
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:20,816
171.65 or .66 or .67,
will all be in this /14 netblock.

21
00:01:20,816 --> 00:01:24,502
So here's a quiz,
what's the decimal subnet mask for

22
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:26,996
a /14 network like Stanford's?

23
00:01:26,996 --> 00:01:29,830
And about how many addresses
are on that network?

24
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,394
Are there around 2,500?

25
00:01:32,394 --> 00:01:34,300
Or around 25,000?

26
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,120
Or are there around two
hundred fifty thousand or

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,210
is it around twenty five million?
