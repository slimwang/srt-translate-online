00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,140
In this lesson we looked at Rational Functions that have horizontal and

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,396
vertical asymptotes and we also talked about how to find them. Get ready for

3
00:00:07,396 --> 00:00:10,202
the next lesson, where we'll learn how to find the domain and the range for

4
00:00:10,202 --> 00:00:15,176
rational functions. Well also talk about one more kind of asymptote. So get

5
00:00:15,176 --> 00:00:15,690
excited.
