1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:00,970
Great.

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,085
Now you've seen how Packer can make
it easier to be sure you're running

3
00:00:05,085 --> 00:00:08,789
the exact same software from
development to production without

4
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:10,996
worrying about changes sneaking in.

5
00:00:10,996 --> 00:00:12,888
>> And no matter where your development
and production environments go,

6
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,725
you can expect a standard
compatible environment.

7
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:16,755
Whether you're running on
servers in your closet, or

8
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:21,095
a hosting provider's data center, or on
a cloud provider, it'll work the same.

9
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:24,265
>> Up ahead in lesson three, we'll take
a look at automating some of the grungy

10
00:00:24,265 --> 00:00:28,215
work taking freshly written code
from a repository, testing it and

11
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:29,755
building it out for deployment.

12
00:00:29,755 --> 00:00:30,255
>> See you then.
