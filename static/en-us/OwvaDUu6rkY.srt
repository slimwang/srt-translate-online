Ready to change some classes?

2
00:00:02,325 --> 00:00:05,620
There's an element in the DOM with the class featured that I want you to change.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,730
An element that's featured sort of has a bluish color background.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,850
Can you use the .toggle class method to remove the featured background from

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,218
Article number 2?

6
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:20,780
Check out the documentation for toggle class and give it a shot.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,980
Before we start, let's see what the page looks like before we toggle the class.

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,180
I've gone ahead and hit Test Run, and I'll scroll down.

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,880
We can see that Article 2 has this blue background.
