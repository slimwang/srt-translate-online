1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,419
In addition to creating
a unifying style for your app,

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,759
it's also important to design your app
to look good across different devices.

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,550
Android devices include everything from
small watches to phones to large tablets

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,860
and even TVs.

5
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:16,369
And the same layout on the phone
won't necessarily look

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,740
great on a screen with a different size.

7
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:21,889
Fortunately, the platform has
been built with that in mind.

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,370
So there are already tools that you can
use to optimize the user experience

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,080
across different devices.

10
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,449
You've already seen an example of this
when you created this landscape layout

11
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,140
in the last lesson.

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,780
This lets you customize the appearance
of the app when it changes its

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,140
orientation from portrait to landscape
and we'll go through the same process to

14
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,929
customize the layout for
different screen sizes.

15
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:44,210
This is called responsive design.

16
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,120
Responsive design is the act of
creating designs that respond to and

17
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,097
work well on a variety of screen sizes,
shapes and orientation, and

18
00:00:52,097 --> 00:00:54,237
we'll see examples of this in a bit.

19
00:00:54,237 --> 00:00:56,878
But first, let's talk about
the different screen sizes and

20
00:00:56,878 --> 00:00:59,429
resolutions you might expect
your app to be installed on.
