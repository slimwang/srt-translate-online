00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,400
In this lesson, we will cover the design of

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,050
big, fast, modern routers. Here's a picture of two modern

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,440
router chassis. On the left, we have a picture

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,630
of the Cisco CRS-1, and on the right, we have

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,850
a picture of the Juniper M320. The M320 has,

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,630
for some time, been used at the border of the

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,100
Georgia Tech network between Georgia Tech and the rest of

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,090
the Internet. Here's a picture of a couple of line

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,790
cards that go into these chassis. These kind of

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,260
look like network interface cards, except the ports are

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,510
special, instead of terminating ethernet, these ports terminate high

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,970
capacity fiber links. As you can see, these cards

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,390
are actually a whole lot bigger than your typical

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,310
network interface card as well. And, as a result,

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,400
these chassis are often anywhere from three to six

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,740
feet tall, and can fill up an entire rack.

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,940
There's a significant need for big, fast

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,070
routers. Links are getting faster. Traffic demands are

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,220
also increasing, particularly with the rise of demanding

20
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,190
applications, such as streaming video. Networks are getting

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,725
bigger too, in terms of the number of

22
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:08,760
hosts, routers, and users. So there's a perennial

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,300
need to design big, fast routers, particularly in

24
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,890
Internet backbone networks. The rest of this lesson

25
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,770
will focus on how a router works, in particular,

26
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,100
how it goes from the process of taking a

27
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,050
packet as input and sending it on to where

28
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,790
it needs to go. The Internet's routing protocols, of course,

29
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,300
are responsible for populating the forwarding tables on a

30
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,860
router. But once those tables are populated, the router still

31
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,770
has the hard job of taking a packet as

32
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,170
input and ultimately getting it to the appropriate output port,

33
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,800
so that the traffic can proceed and route to the destination.
