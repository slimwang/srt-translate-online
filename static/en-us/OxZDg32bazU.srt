1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,486
With the X axis east and the Y axis north and the Z axis up like this, that

2
00:00:04,486 --> 00:00:11,550
forms a right handed coordinate system. So, this is the correct answer. What's

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,700
interesting is that if you swap the latitude and longitude, and so, list the

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,050
coordinates as latitude, longitude and altitude, the coordinate system is now

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,474
left handed. It also swaps if you consider west to increase the longitude or

6
00:00:22,474 --> 00:00:24,550
south to increase the latitude.
