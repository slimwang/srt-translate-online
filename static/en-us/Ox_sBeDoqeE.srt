1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,847
The answer is 2 plus or minus the square root of 19, all divided by 3, or we

2
00:00:03,847 --> 00:00:09,511
could list this as 2 3rds plus or minus root 19 divided by 3. Either way we

3
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:14,170
write it, these two solutions are correct. We get these answers by first making

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,966
the negative of b, so this will become positive 4. Negative 4 squared is 16,

5
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:24,580
and these numbers multiplied together are positive 60. We have negative 4 times

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,178
3 times negative 5. Because two of these signs are negative, we wind up with a

7
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:33,349
positive product. This is where I mentioned a sign error usually occurs. You

8
00:00:33,349 --> 00:00:36,216
want to watch out to see if you have an even number of negative signs or if you

9
00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:40,670
have an odd number of negative signs. We add 16 and 60 to get the square root

10
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:46,730
of 76, and then, we simplify the square root by breaking it down to 4 times 19.

11
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,682
The square root of 4 equals 2, and then, we can split up 6 into 2 times 3. This

12
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:56,110
allows us to root a common factor 2 from each of the terms. We know 2 divides

13
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,296
into 4 two times, and 2 divides into 2 one time. This leaves us with 2 plus or

14
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:05,929
minus 1 root 19 in our numerator and positive 3 in our denominator.
