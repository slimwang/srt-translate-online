1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,152
Novel distributed multimedia applications tend to

2
00:00:04,152 --> 00:00:08,410
be sensor-based. And these sensors can be

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,430
simple sensors, like temperature sensors and

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,240
humidity sensors, or more interesting and complex

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,690
sensors, like cameras and microphones and radars and so on. And these sensors

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:26,140
are distributed, which means that you have to access them via the internet.

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,518
And what we want to do with these sensor streams is live-stream analysis,

8
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,110
and often, often such applications are

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,920
also called situation awareness applications. Where what

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,290
we are doing is we are gathering sensor data in order to analyze in

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,760
real time what is happening in the environment and take appropriate decisions.

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,590
So such situation awareness applications exhibit a

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,150
control loop going from sensing, prioritizing the sense

14
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,060
data to figure out what are important.

15
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,720
For instance, if there are lots of cameras

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
and there is no action in front

17
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,070
of some cameras, some cameras are more interesting

18
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,255
than others. That is the prioritization step,

19
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:17,670
of figuring out what sensors are interesting and

20
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,520
then devoting more computational resources to analyze the camera streams

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,520
or other sensor streams and as a result of that, taking some actions. And this

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,370
might involve actuating other sensors, actuating

23
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:38,000
triggers, actuating other software entities, or even

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,980
humans, to intervene in terms of what actions were needed to be taken.

25
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,450
And part of this control loop may also

26
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,110
be feedback to the sensors themselves to re-target them.

27
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,700
For example, there may be a camera that you

28
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,970
may want to point in a different direction. And

29
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,320
there are cameras like pan, tilt, zoom cameras,

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,240
which you may want to control depending on what

31
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,070
you are observing in the environment. And such a

32
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:09,449
control loop characterization of situation awareness applications can be

33
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,590
applied to a lot of

34
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,690
emerging distributed multimedia sensor-based, applications such

35
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,880
as traffic analysis, emergency response, disaster

36
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,570
recovery, robotics, acid tracking and so

37
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:29,530
on and all such applications are computationally intensive. And because they

38
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,576
are dealing with real live streams coming from the sensors, they have real-time

39
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:39,990
properties, which means that there is a need to shrink the

40
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:46,110
latency from sensing to actuation, so that we can take tiny

41
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,020
actions based on the sensed data. Since they're computationally intensive, we

42
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,465
need horsepower to run these

43
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:59,520
large-scale novel multimedia distributed sensor-based applications.

44
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,460
And so computational engines such as the clusters and the clouds may be deployed

45
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,370
in order to cater to the needs

46
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,144
of these large scale, sensor-based distributed applications.
