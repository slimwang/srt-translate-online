1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,900
So how to get the putative matches.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,200
We talked a little bit so

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,500
far about essentially doing exhaustive search, where you, you know,

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,990
compare one against every other and you, pick the one that's best.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,110
We also talked about hashing and nearest neighbor, techniques.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,590
But.

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,560
You now find a best match.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,510
How do we know it's a good one?

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,190
Okay.

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,930
So, in this next lesson, not today, we're going to talk about looking at

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,110
the global solution that's suggested by this match and

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,120
using that to prune off some, some of these, but even before that,

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,830
there's something we can do at the local level.

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,050
And here, here's the idea.

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,260
So, we don't want to.

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,220
We're not going to match everything.

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,750
We're only going to take, match the ones that have good enough matching.

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,540
All right?

19
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,220
So, how do we do that?

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,780
Okay? Well here would be a simple idea.

21
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,790
You find the best match.

22
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,250
And you take the correlation.

23
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,600
A little patch from here.

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,019
A little patch from there.

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,380
And you do it says here SSD.

26
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,530
Sum of squared differences.

27
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,870
Remember where we talked about that?

28
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,210
And we could say, all right, well if that number is less that

29
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,400
a certain threshold, we're going to accept that match.

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,130
By the way, something that I've said before and is implicit here and

31
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,350
we'll say it again later.

32
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:25,560
The general idea is I need to find enough good matches.

33
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,020
Not all of them.

34
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,840
And I need to not find too many bad matches.

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,980
So the goal is to try to get a bucket of good matches with

36
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,990
only some bad matches thrown in.

37
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,300
So, going back to the SSD, the question would be how to set that threshold.

38
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,770
So, empirically, you can start to take a look at this.

39
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,270
All right.
