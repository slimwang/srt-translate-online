00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,560
At the time of this recording,

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,939
the most recent version of Gradle was
Gradle 2.3 running on Groovy 2.3.9.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:10,040
The time it takes for Gradle to start
up will depend on your machine.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,110
On my machine, to start up with no
Daemon running took 4.1 seconds,

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,070
and then once the Daemon was already
running, it only took 1.2 seconds.

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,120
Awesome work getting Gradle
installed and the Daemon configured.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,980
Let's learn more about what
we can do with Gradle.
