00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,864
In interactive rendering systems, a color is defined by three values: red, green

2
00:00:05,864 --> 00:00:10,537
and blue, abbreviated RGB. Each color value is often called a channel. These

3
00:00:10,537 --> 00:00:16,145
values are usually in this order in most systems, RGB. That said, once in awhile

4
00:00:16,145 --> 00:00:20,718
you'll run into data in the order BGR, blue, green, red. Which is RGB's evil

5
00:00:20,718 --> 00:00:24,708
twin. Without properly swapping the channels, you'll see some odd-looking

6
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:28,760
images, such as this one on the right. The green stem looks fine, since the

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,532
green channel is in the same place, but what was once red is now blue. Okay, now

8
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:38,292
you've been warned. We usually define colors in one of two ways, as floating

9
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:42,500
point numbers or as integers. We'll start with floating points, since that's

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,053
generally the easier one to understand.
