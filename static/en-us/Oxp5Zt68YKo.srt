00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,488
Well we know that the formula for calculating the volume of a rectangular prism

2
00:00:04,488 --> 00:00:08,500
or a box like this, is just to multiply the length, the width, and height

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,580
together. So all we need to do is plug in the values that we know for each of

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,099
those quantities. So we'll have 10 centimeters times 8 centimeters times 5

5
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:21,897
centimeters, and that gives us a final answer of 400 centimeters cubed. Or, in

6
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,321
other words, 400 cubic centimeters.
