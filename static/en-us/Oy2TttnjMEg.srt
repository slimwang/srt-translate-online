00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,980
While we're looking at the person class, we didn't implement the

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,130
unfriend method when we refactored our code. But now you know how

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,120
to remove items from an array list. So let me see. If

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,740
I want to remove a person, nonfriend. what if I try getting

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,350
the name of nonfriend, going through the list to find its index,

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,900
and then removing that index? Is there anything wrong with this? Refactoring

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,850
to save an array list of the friends names was a step

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,390
in the right direction, but not enough. If I have two friends

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,440
with the same name, I wouldn't know which one to remove. In

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,500
fact, I can't even tell if I have the same friend in

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,250
here twice right now. I shouldn't just be storing a list of

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,280
the friends' names, I should be storing a list of the person

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,300
object associated with each friend. So let's refactor again I'll make my

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,630
ArrayList of String that I called friends before into an ArrayList of

15
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,080
Person. Now I'll have to fix the way I initialize it in

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,590
the constructor. And let's look at that implementation of the getFriends method

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,470
with the separator. Now I need to actually get the name

18
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,790
out of the friend stored at this position. I'll show you

19
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,920
what happens if I don't do that. Whenever I try to

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,000
print out the result of getFriends, instead of printing the person's name,

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,040
it's printing the class, and this weird jumble of symbols. Right

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,280
now, the array list to string method doesn't know how to make

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,320
a string representation of a person. So it just prints the

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,830
reference. These symbols make sense to the computer, but not to people.

25
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,780
So to avoid that mess, in the getFriends

26
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,280
method, I'll get the name from the friend, and

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,240
add that And I'll do it in both

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,480
spots. Can you finish the rest of this refactoring?
