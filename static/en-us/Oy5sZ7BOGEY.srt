00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,366
So as I said moods are longer lasting affective experiences and usually are not

2
00:00:04,366 --> 00:00:09,431
in response to very specific situations. Moods can last minutes or hours and

3
00:00:09,431 --> 00:00:13,457
occasionally even longer and as for the cause of moods, as compared to emotion,

4
00:00:13,457 --> 00:00:18,591
the cause is vague and not clear. We often just find ourselves in a good mood

5
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:21,330
or in a bad mood and we don't really know why.
