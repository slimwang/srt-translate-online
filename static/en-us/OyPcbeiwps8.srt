1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,530
Okay, Michael, so let's, let's look at this little line

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,340
segment, okay? And then say I've got ten little points that

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,580
I could put down on this line segment, and I want

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,850
them all to represent some part of this line, alright? That's

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,590
kind of K nearest neighbor-y/-ish. So, I'm going to put a little

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,670
X here, I'll put one here, I'll put one here, put

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,024
one here, put one here, here, here, here, here, here. Is

8
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:25,790
that ten? Three... six. Nine, ten. Ten. Okay. And let's pretend

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,060
I did the right thing here and I have them

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,870
kind of uniformly distributed across the line segment. So that means

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,340
each one of these points is sort of owning, an

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,190
equal size sub segment of this segment. Does that make sense?

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,970
>> Yeah, so, so it's representing it in the sense that, that point. Uh,when

14
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,110
you're trying to estimate values of other places on the line it's going to

15
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,700
default as the nearest neighbor to being

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,360
that point so there's a very small little

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,730
neighborhood of the red line segment that is covered by each of the green X's.

18
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,320
>> That is exactly right and in fact each one

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,440
of these green X's represents. How much of this segment?

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,650
>> Each of the green X's covers one tenth?

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,960
>> That's exactly right. You cover one tenth. Alright

22
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,220
Michael, so let's say I move from a line

23
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,560
segment now to a two dimensional space. So

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,230
a little square segment. If that's the right

25
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,850
technical term. And I've taken my little ten

26
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,890
x's, and I put them down here before. Well,

27
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,960
here's something you'll notice; you'll notice that each

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,850
one of these x's is going to still end

29
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,410
up representing one-tenth of all of this space,

30
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,418
but you'll also notice that, that, that it's representing

31
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:45,180
now you know. Really really really really big.

32
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,010
>> I see.

33
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,060
>> So one way of putting it is, you know if you think

34
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,320
about the farthest point, as opposed to

35
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,110
the furthest point which would be incorrect.

36
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:54,360
>> [LAUGH]

37
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,850
>> The farthest point that this particular first x

38
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,690
over here is representing, its got some distance here.

39
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,940
Over here, the farthest point from this x, the

40
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,620
distance is very, very far away. So, a question

41
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,810
would be, how can I make it so that each of

42
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,070
the x's I put down represents the same amount of. I

43
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,310
don't know diameter or distance as the xs in this line

44
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,960
segment over here. So what do you think I have to do?

45
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,840
>> I feel like you need to fill up the square with xs.

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,480
>> Yeah, that's exactly right so let's do that. So

47
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,710
filling em up Michael as you suggested. You'll notice that

48
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,490
at least if we pretend that I drew this right. Each of

49
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,330
these X's is now going to end up being the nearest neighbor for

50
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:44,170
a little square like this, and the diameter of these little squares are

51
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,920
going to be the same as the diameter of these little line segments.

52
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,660
>> Yeah, I agree for some definition of the word diameter.

53
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,800
>> Yes, and for some definition of our demonstration. Okay, so how

54
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,430
many of these X's are there, Michael? Can you tell? You want to count?

55
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,671
>> [LAUGH].

56
00:02:57,671 --> 00:03:00,401
I'm going to multiple [CROSSTALK] cause it looks like

57
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:02,620
you did ten by ten so that'll be 100.

58
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,010
>> That'll be 100. So each one now holds a hundredth of the space, and I went

59
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:11,010
from needing ten points to, of course, 100 points

60
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,870
in order to cover the same amount of space.

61
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,140
>> Alright, so that definitely seems like the mild rebuke of dimensionality.

62
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,990
>> Yes.

63
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,530
>> But doesn't seem that bad.

64
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,760
>> Okay well, what happens if I now move into three dimensions?

65
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,900
So now, if I want to cover the same amount of, you know,

66
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,000
diameter space for, you know, sufficient

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,770
definition of diameter. I'm going to have

68
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,080
to do a bunch of copying and pasting that I'm not willing

69
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,960
to do so, you know, there would be more x's here and

70
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,690
you know, there will be x's there and an x here and

71
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,510
it'll just kind of go and fill up some space and you

72
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,378
know, I'm not going to do this whatever but [SOUND] and you'll get

73
00:03:45,378 --> 00:03:48,950
x's everywhere. And you notice, I need a lot more X's than

74
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,660
I had before. And by the way, I'm just

75
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,850
showing you the outside of this little cube, there are

76
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,890
actually X's on the inside as well, that you

77
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,210
can't see. How many X's do you think I have?

78
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,450
>> I don't think you drew any X's. You're

79
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,360
just like scribbling on the side of the cube.

80
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,160
>> These are X's.

81
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,840
>> You, you were doing so well for awhile, and then just lost it entirely.

82
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,210
>> Well, wouldn't you lose it if you had to write 1000 x's.

83
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,790
>> Hm. No

84
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,870
because I would use computers to help me but yes, yes it is very

85
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,700
frustrating to have to have that many x's. And so but in particular in

86
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,770
this case we're talking about data points in a nearest neighbor method and that,

87
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,346
boy that does seem like a big growth from ten to a 100 to 1000.

88
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:31,576
>> In fact the growth is, exponential.

89
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:32,628
>> Exponential

90
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:36,290
>> >Right. So if we went into four dimensions, which

91
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,986
I'm not going to draw, then we would need not

92
00:04:39,986 --> 00:04:44,267
1,000, but 10,000 points. And if five dimensions we would

93
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:48,184
need 100,000 points. And in six dimensions, we would need 1,000,000

94
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:51,990
points. And so on and so forth. So something like.

95
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,070
Ten to the D, where D is the number of dimensions.

96
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,370
>> Wow.

97
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,880
>> Right. So this is really problematic right.

98
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,460
In my little nearest neighbor method, wanted to be

99
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,870
able to say, well, I want to make

100
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,470
sure the neighborhood remains small, as I add dimensions,

101
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,530
I'm going to need to grow the number of points that

102
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,100
I have in my training set exponentially. And that's really bad.

103
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,912
And by the way, this isn't just an issue of

104
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:17,860
kNN. This is true in general, don't think about this now

105
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,290
as nearest neighbors in the sense of kNN, but think

106
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,950
of it as points that are representing or covering the space.

107
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,340
And if you want to represent the same sort of hyper-volume

108
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,160
of space as you add dimensions, you're going to have to get

109
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,030
exponentially more points in order to do that. And

110
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,630
coverage is necessary to do learning. So the curse

111
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,830
of dimensionality does not just to kNN.

112
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,930
It is a curse of dimensionality for ML period [SOUND].

113
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,990
>> You mean for me?

114
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,252
>> Yes. Because of [INAUDIBLE]

115
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:53,030
>> [LAUGH] Okay. And that seems really problematic because it's very

116
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,470
natural to just keep throwing dimensions into a machine learning problem.

117
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,940
Like it's, it's having trouble learning. Let me

118
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,640
give it a few more dimensions so, to give

119
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,820
it hints. But really what you're doing is just

120
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,150
giving it a larger and larger volume to fill.

121
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,300
>> Yeah. And it can't fill it unless you give it more and more

122
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,120
data. So you're better off giving more data than you are giving more dimensions.

123
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,910
>> Zoinks.

124
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,650
>> Mm-hm. There's an entire series of lessons that

125
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,800
we will get eventually that, that deals with this issue.

126
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,150
>> The issue of?

127
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,250
>> Dimensionality.

128
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,540
>> Finding the right dimensionality?

129
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,040
>> Yeah.

130
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,430
>> That would be a useful thing.

131
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,560
>> It would. But it's far off in the future. It's like infinitely

132
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,980
far in the future. So we'll worry about that in a few weeks.

133
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,150
>> Okay.

134
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,760
>> Okay. All right. So there you go, Michael.

135
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,200
Curse of Dimensionality is real and it's a real problem.

136
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,790
>> Where did that term come from, it's a cool

137
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,420
term. I think it came from, oh what's his name. Bellman.

138
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,960
>> Oh, Bellman, like the dynamic programming guy.

139
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,362
>> Yeah, the dynamic programming guy,

140
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:50,910
uh,the Bellman of Bellman equation guy.

141
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,580
>> Which we haven't gotten to yet in the course.

142
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,640
>> Which we haven't gotten to in the course but we will get to in the

143
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,440
course. Because it's central. So it looks like

144
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,110
actually, the element's central to a lot of things.

145
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,070
>> Wow.

146
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,860
>> Sometimes it gives us equations that

147
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,260
helps us but sometimes it gives us curses.

148
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,490
>> [LAUGH] Curses Betterman. Foiled again.

149
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,837
>> [LAUGH]
