1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here are our equations again for the mean and the variance.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
They should now look very familiar.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The problem with that is they require two passes through the data.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
First, I have to go through all the data and compute the mean.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I do this by summing up all the data and dividing it by the total number of data items.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
For that, I maintain two things.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I maintain the total number of data items, which I increment every time I see a new item.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I maintain the sum of all Xᵢs, which I can easily add up as I go through the data.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Once I've done this, I know µ, and then I can finally plug it in here,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but now I have to go through the data again and compute this guy,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so we can finally get to my covariance.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now, I want to teach you a trick now for which we don't maintain this guy

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but instead maintain just this guy.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The nice thing about this is if you maintain these three things you only need a single pass.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
To see, as we go through the data, we can maintain the number of data items that we have.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We can maintain the sum over here.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We can maintain the sum of the data themselves.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You can maintain simultaneously the sum of the square of the data items,

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but it's not obvious that from these three things alone

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
you can figure out what σ² is.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's play a game.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The way the game works is that I put a number of mathematical expressions here on the right side.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll start the derivation and leave little gaps and ask you to pick one of those

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and plug it into the equation.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You can only use each of those ones but you won't use all of them, just a subset.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let me do the first step by hand and rewrite σ² by factoring out the square.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I can rewrite this by multiplying things out.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So, help me. What do you think goes in the middle?

29
00:01:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Which of those expressions?
