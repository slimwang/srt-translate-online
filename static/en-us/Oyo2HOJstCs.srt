00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,460
And the first thing you get is this really terrible

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,530
plot with one big, tall bar. And that's because most people

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,350
guessed a kind of small number, but at least one

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,170
person guessed 10 million people, saw my post, which was not

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,270
true. The first thing I needed to do was adjust

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,980
the axes so that I could actually see the bulk of

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,240
the data. So, I cut this one outlier out. And

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,370
then, I looked basically at people who guessed a few thousand

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,820
or, or below. Then, then you get a slightly better histogram by

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,920
adjusting the axes. And, you can still see that the bulk of

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,700
the data was in the smaller ranges, but it still was kind

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,330
of hard to, to see how large people thought their audiences were.

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,660
>> Moira just explained how she encountered an outlier in

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,970
her data. And I want you to think about what

15
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,050
type of outlier do you think it was. So, try

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,690
answering this question. Do you think Moira's outlier was an example

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,170
of bad data about a non-extreme case, bad data about an extreme case,

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,940
or was it good data about an extreme case? Choose the best answer here.
