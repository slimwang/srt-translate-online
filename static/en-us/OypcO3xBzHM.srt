1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,710
The way ember handles nested
routes is one thing that makes it

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,020
a fantastic framework.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,630
So it's important that you're
comfortable both generating nested

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,580
routes and
working with them in a nested format.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,105
We're going to be working
with our toy store again.

6
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:14,845
You're going to be working
with nested routes and

7
00:00:14,845 --> 00:00:16,605
then modifying their templates.

8
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:18,275
Here are the instructions for this quiz.

9
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:21,055
Make sure to go in order,
If you try to do this second step

10
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:23,945
before this first one it won't work and
you'll get a blank page.

11
00:00:23,945 --> 00:00:26,515
So start at the top and
work your way down.

12
00:00:26,515 --> 00:00:29,225
The link to the starter code for
this project is in the instructor notes.

13
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:30,855
When you finish building the template,

14
00:00:30,855 --> 00:00:32,885
the feedback extension
will give you a code.

15
00:00:32,885 --> 00:00:35,246
Enter that code on the next page,
have fun.

16
00:00:35,246 --> 00:00:38,420
Ember uses the queue unit
testing framework, and

17
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,250
I created a number of tests
that you need to satisfy.

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,090
These tests help guide you through
completing the assignment.

19
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,560
Once all the tests have passed, the
feedback extension will give you a code.

20
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,320
Enter that code on the next page.

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,280
You can find a link to this project's
test page in the project's read me file.
