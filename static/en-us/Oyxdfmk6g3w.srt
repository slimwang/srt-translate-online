00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,730
We've covered how to
send screen view hits and

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,620
event hits from Tag Manager
to Google Analytics.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,359
But as you learned previously, there are
other kinds of hits that you can send.

4
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:13,971
These include e-commerce,
timing, and exception hits.

5
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:17,741
Now that you understand how to use
variables, triggers, and tags,

6
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:21,771
you should be able to apply those same
principles to sending other kinds of

7
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:22,690
tracking hits.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,253
You can find resources to
help in the instructor notes.

9
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:30,294
You can also register functions that
get invoked by Tag Manager triggers.

10
00:00:30,294 --> 00:00:32,860
Take a look at the documentation
to learn more about that.
