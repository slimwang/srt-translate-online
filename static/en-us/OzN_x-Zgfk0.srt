00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] So, now we're ready for a quiz about aliasing.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The question is what is the value of agent index 2 after the following code runs?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And we have 3 assignment statements.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The first assignment statement creates the list 0, 0, 7,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and assigns that to the variable named spy.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The second assignment assigns spy to the variable named agent,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and then the third assignment assigns agent index 2 +1

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
to the position at spy index 2.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So what's the value of agent 2 after all of this code?
