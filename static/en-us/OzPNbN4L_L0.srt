00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,850
Just touching up some of the code here its fairly simple so

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,840
I'll explain it quickly.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:12,070
But instead of setting the radius automatically equal to some radius constant.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,750
And setting the fill to the constant color, in this case blue.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,401
We've put an if conditional in our accessor function to

6
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:24,370
basically make the radius dynamic or dependent on the data.

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,050
Again, we're letting the data,

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,710
in this case the bound data, represented by d for each circle,

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,730
drive how the visual representation of our graphic is on the screen.

10
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:42,130
In this case, if the home column correspond to team one or

11
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,660
team two so the home country, is one team in this game.

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,810
So we return the radius.

13
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:53,700
And what I've set here as the multiplier, again I create a variable earlier on,

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,610
so I can have a more dynamic size increase.

15
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,334
In this case, my multiplier is simply set to be 1.5,

16
00:01:01,334 --> 00:01:05,657
which has the effect of creating your radius of 4.5.

17
00:01:05,657 --> 00:01:08,040
If you want it exactly five.

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,570
I could simply return five instead of the radius.

19
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,550
But this multiplier let me play around in a more flexible way

20
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,820
with the visual representation.

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,960
And a very similar process for the color.

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,150
We simply check whether the home team is involved, and

23
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,880
then return either red or blue.

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,230
Since we've copied a lot of the code for

25
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:35,140
each of these, we could actually abstract this further into a common function

26
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,080
to basically return true or false of whether or not the home team's playing.

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,400
And then possibly pass in two different values.

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,140
Again, for sake of clarity I kept it verbose.
