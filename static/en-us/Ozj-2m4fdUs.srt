Hi there, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:05,070
This week we're getting into
the cool stuff with Tensorflow.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,089
In this lesson, Vincent will show you
how to build a multilayer network,

4
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:12,849
which you've seen before but
now you going to do it in Tensorflow.

5
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:15,640
Next, you'll learn how to
use a deep neural network

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,350
to extract features from images.

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,790
These types of models are called
Convolutional Networks or ConvNets.

8
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,000
That could be used to detect and

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,969
recognize objects and
pictures with amazing accuracy.

10
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:34,394
Also AWS credits, you'll each get $100
of credits to use on AWS Cloud machines.

11
00:00:34,395 --> 00:00:38,430
We've built a lesson to teach you
how to use an AWS EC2 instance for

12
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:40,670
training your networks on a GPU.

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,440
It'll change your life.

14
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:45,589
And finally we're launching
the second project.

15
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,690
It's on object recognition.

16
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:52,390
You'll train a convolution network on
a bunch of images from the data set.

17
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,009
It'll be able to differentiate between
frogs, and cats, and cars, and planes.

18
00:00:57,009 --> 00:00:59,589
I think you'll find it
an interesting challenge.

19
00:00:59,590 --> 00:00:59,870
Cheers.
