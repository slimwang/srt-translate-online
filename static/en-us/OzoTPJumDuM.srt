1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go through the answers together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Perhaps the easiest to look at is good old Ralph Waldo Emerson.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Ralph is one identifier.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Emerson is one identifier. 1803 is a number.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's transcendental-tastic.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This totally matches the pattern we're looking for.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
By contrast, Henry is an identifier.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Thoreau is an identifier, but these 2 slashes begin an end of line comment,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
so we'll never see the 1817, so this one does not match.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Down here, Marie Curie 1867, this would be identifier, identifier, number,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
except that the whole thing is canceled out by this end of line comment

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that starts over here.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Then up here, her daughter, Irene, this is one identifier.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This connected by an underscore is just one more identifier.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Here's a number.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We match perfectly so far.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It looks like we'd stop matching because of this fourth number,

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
but since it's in a comment, we ignore it, so both of these work.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And Marie Curie is relatively well known as a Polish physicist and chemist.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
She was the first person to hold Nobel prizes,

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
quite a feat, one in physics and one in chemistry,

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and in fact, she named the element polonium after her home country.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Thoreau wrote "Walden," which is relatively well known,

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
a book about being self-reliant and dependable

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
in which he starts on the first page by borrowing an ax from his neighbor.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Marie Curie's daughter, Irene, also went on to win a Nobel prize

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
for the discovery of artificial radioactivity.
