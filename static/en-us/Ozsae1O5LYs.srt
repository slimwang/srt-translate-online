1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,839
So now you've seen that even if we

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,300
can observe a pattern between two variables, we always

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,380
have to consider lurking variables. Referring back to

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,380
our sleep data we see that there's a relationship

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,500
between hours slept and temporal memory but we

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,840
can't necessarily be confident that sleep causes better memory.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,340
What if we wanted to prove that sleep

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,290
causes better memory? Well, if we want to show relationships

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,830
only as with scatter plots, we can

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,400
do observational studies where we just take note

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,940
of already existing data or we can do

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,810
surveys where people are the main subjects and

13
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,040
we ask them questions that we're interested in knowing the answers to. But if we

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,990
want to show causation that one particular variable causes

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,120
another then we'd have to a controlled experiment.

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,710
Throughout this course, you'll see a lot of examples of

17
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,260
controlled experiments. And we're also going to ask you a

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,960
lot of survey questions and then we can analyze the

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,629
data you give us. Let's take a closer look at surveys
