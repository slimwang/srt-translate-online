00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,950
The total area in this region is 0.975. Or, you could just look at the area in

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:13,492
this region 0.025. And then, find those proportions in the z table. If we look

3
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:20,502
for the proportion 0.975, we find that the z score is 1.96. And if we look for

4
00:00:20,502 --> 00:00:26,304
