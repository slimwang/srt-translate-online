1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,029
If you followed the previous step,

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:06,700
you saw that text like this
can turn into text like this.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,340
And even though you don't
know how this happened,

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,840
you probably can guess that these tags
here had something to do with it.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,270
Somehow the computer was interpreting
those things differently

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,570
than how a person would.

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,910
And that is a huge idea.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,590
Because before this experience
you probably didn't even

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,820
know what you didn't know
about making web pages.

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,630
And now, even though you don't really
know how to talk to a computer,

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,720
you may have some understanding of
what talking to a computer even means.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,310
You're beginning to know,
what you don't know.

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,170
And may even have a basic intuition for
what coding even is.

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,220
Because coding a computer,
is just telling a computer

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,540
what you want it to do, by writing text,
in a way it can understand.
