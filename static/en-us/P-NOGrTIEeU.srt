1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,920
The operating system plays
a really critical role

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,600
in protecting resources
in a computer system.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,900
Resources such as memory pages, or

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,990
files, that might
contain sensitive data.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,730
It makes use of hardware
functionality and

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,870
uses that to isolate itself
from un-trusted user code, and

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:23,510
also can isolate one user's process
from a different user' s process.

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,430
So we're going to see how that
is done by the operating system.
