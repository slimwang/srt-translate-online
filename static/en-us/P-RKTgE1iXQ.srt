1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So the question is, what's the purpose of the minimum viable product?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It turns out that the answer is pretty specific.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You want to test the ability of some portion of your product and meet minimal customer needs

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and that might change over time but as the MVP slowly grows

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
as your confidence in what the customer archetype is.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's not how to get as much as revenue as you can as early as you can.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You might decide that's a strategy but that's kind of a counter in learning from an MVP.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You typically only make this choice when you actually feel pretty certain

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that you understand product market fit.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And while we certainly want to identify bugs in a product

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
hopefully if we've been using an agile methodology,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
we kind of squash most of them before they've gone out the door.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Explicitly the goal of an MVP is not an engineering alpha or beta test.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The goal was not to use this process to find all the bugs though they might come up.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The goal of an MVP is to actually test the ability of the product

16
00:00:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to meet minimal customer needs as in choice one.
