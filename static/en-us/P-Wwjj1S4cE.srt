00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In mathematics, when an expression gets complicated, we can add parenthesis

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:13,000
to show structure or grouping--(x - 3) x 5 is different than x - (3 x 5).

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Python regular expressions have similar parenthesis,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but they're written a litttle differently.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The closing parenthesis looks just the same,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but the opening parenthesis--the version you'll be using in this class--is 3 characters--

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
(?: ).

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There's a simple example.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This regular expression makes a group around xyz and then this whole thing

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
can be repeated 1 or more times,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
so some strings are xyz, xyzxyz, and so on.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Suppose we want to find words made up of combinations of musical notes.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
In Western music, the notes are often given names--do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti--

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and you could put them together in various combinations--re, fa, fa--do, do, re--

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
stuff like that.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Let's say we want to recognize words that are made up of these syllables in order,

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
or these syllables not in order but in any combination.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So we set out to try it.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We can have a bunch of do's or a bunch of re's or a bunch of mi's.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's say we're looking for all of the matching strings in mimi, rere, midore, doo-wop,

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and we want to see which ones we get.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We'd like to get mimi as 1, rere as another, midore, and then maybe do,

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
just sort of as a corner case,

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
but mostly these 3,

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
but we will be unpleasantly surprised.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We would really expect something like mi+ to get mimi.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Maximum munch rule, why have you betrayed us?

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
If you look over here, you'll see that actually everyone of these little musical syllables--

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
'mi', 'mi', 're', 're', 'mi', 'do', 're'--seem to come out separately.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why? Well, if you think about it, in the regular expression 'mi+",

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
the plus only effects the "i", so really this is getting mi, mii, miii--

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
an entire virtue of selfishness--rather than the thing that we wanted.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You can actually see this over here at the end where do+ got us doo from doo-wop.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So here, the + isn't applying to the right thing, isn't binding correctly.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This isn't quite the right way to do it.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This, however, is.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Note our use of the parenthesis in regular expressions--

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
(?:--marks the beginning of such a group--),

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and then here in the middle we have do/re/mi.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Anything inside this group can be repeated 1 or more times.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This gets us just the answer we were looking for.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
For a more thorough investigation of musical notes and the associated words,

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I recommend The Sound of Music,

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
but it's also worth pointing out that a very popular computer musical format or interface

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
M-I-D-I--MIDI, the musical instrument digital interface used for recording

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
things like pianos or synthesizers or drum sets, is more or less exactly what we've seen here.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Basically, a list of notes and modifiers and combinations over and over again.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
By contrast, formats like MP3 or other audio compression approaches for recording voice,

49
00:03:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
do not follow this general pattern, or at least they don't look like they do at first blush.
