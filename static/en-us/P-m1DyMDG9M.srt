1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,980
So in summary, I presented how a camera operates.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,220
Brought together the concepts of aperture opening,

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,700
shutter speed, and film sensitivity, for optimized photographic exposure.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,530
And we discussed the impact of exposure triangle and

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,850
it combines various aspects of photography.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,960
Now, this part of the lecture was much more driven by the basic concept

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,140
of photography.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,060
Do remember, we are interested in being able to kind of generate images and

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,510
also understand the computational aspect of how we can control various sets of

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,270
parameters which would then allow us to do computational photography.
