1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,200
The left side of our equation looks good now. This is exactly the sort of thing

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,460
that we're looking for, y minus the constant. The right side is not quite there

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,603
yet though. Eventually, we want this to be x minus some constant and that whole

4
00:00:12,603 --> 00:00:16,717
thing squared. Well, if you think about it, we're actually well on our way. If

5
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:20,685
you think about this right side in the general form of this equation, we can

6
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:24,653
multiply out the quantity x minus h squared to get x squared minus 2hx plus h

7
00:00:24,653 --> 00:00:29,217
squared. You've seen things like this a lot of times before. So here, it looks

8
00:00:29,217 --> 00:00:33,371
like we have this term covered, the x squared term, and we also have the term

9
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:37,755
the x to the first covered. What we're missing is this constant. What constant

10
00:00:37,755 --> 00:00:41,403
do we need to add on to the end of x squared minus 8x in order to be able to

11
00:00:41,403 --> 00:00:45,509
factor it in the form x minus h squared. So, just think of what constant belongs

12
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:49,596
here in order to make this expression on the right-hand side, the perfect square

13
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:51,357
of some polynomial of two terms.
