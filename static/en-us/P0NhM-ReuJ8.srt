It should print 12, and 3 plus 4 plus 5 with all the spaces. This might have

2
00:00:05,986 --> 00:00:09,726
been different from what you expected. We didn't use quotation marks here. The

3
00:00:09,726 --> 00:00:15,856
quotation marks mark literal text. If we use quotes, it means that we want to

4
00:00:15,856 --> 00:00:23,445
write 3 plus 4 plus 5 as it is. But when we don;t use quotes, the computer

5
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:28,620
reads 3 plus 4 plus 5 as numbers. It knows how to add the numbers, so it added

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:34,819
the numbers and then it printed the result as you can see here. You can use

7
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:38,899
system.out.println to print numbers and text
