00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's start with an exercise.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Suppose we are in an election, and there are two parties--party A and party B.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And suppose it's a toss up, so both parties are getting the same number of votes--or 50%.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Here are three pie charts.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Will any of those reflect the outcome of the election?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Perhaps the first, the second, or the third, or none of the above.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check exactly one box.
