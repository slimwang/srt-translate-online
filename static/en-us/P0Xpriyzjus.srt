00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,460
Alright? Here are my calculations. I saw that we had

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,000
512 byte cache and the block size is 64 bytes.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,690
So, how many entries could there be? Well, we just

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,195
do the division. We find there are eight. So, that's

5
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:15,895
2 to the 3rd, which means that I only need

6
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:19,330
three bits worth of index. And then to calculate how

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,800
many bits are used for the tag. I start out

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,540
with all 22 bits. I remember that three are used

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:30,560
for the index, and since we have 64 byte cache lines, I say that

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,710
there are six used for the offset, and that leaves me with 13 left over.
