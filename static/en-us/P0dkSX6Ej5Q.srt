1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,440
Is everything okay?

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,190
You seem a little pensive.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,587
>> [SOUND] Yeah I'm just thinking.

4
00:00:07,587 --> 00:00:11,283
You know choosing a back end stack for
an app is a huge decision, and

5
00:00:11,283 --> 00:00:15,639
I'm definitely convinced that Firebase
is a good option given how easy it is to

6
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:18,770
set up, but is it the best option for
the project?

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,810
There are other database
solutions out there.

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,230
I know there's no SQL and SQL Solutions.

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,160
There's Oracle, there's Parse.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,240
I guess we could even build our own
back end if we really wanted to.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,200
So I'm just kind of wondering why
not any of those other options?

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,320
>> First of all Firebase consists of
a database and a collection of services

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,800
which is sometimes referred
to as back end as a service.

14
00:00:42,538 --> 00:00:45,530
Let's look at a few other
database options, and

15
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,710
then compare them to Firebase.

16
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,360
Oracle and SQL are both examples
of relational databases.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,430
These databases are often transaction
based with rollback functionality.

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,430
They're generally used for

19
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,270
larger enterprise applications requiring
a large number of read write operations.

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,120
They're not good choices for Shopping
List Plus Plus because they don't

21
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,140
handle real time applications natively.

22
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,130
Parse is similar to Firebase in
that it is a back end as a service.

23
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,480
It is a no SQL implementation and
uses MongoDB as its database.

24
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,280
For Shopping List Plus Plus
it's a better choice, but

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,630
it still requires third party support
to build real time applications.

26
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,620
Firebase is also implemented
as a no SQL solution

27
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,460
with the database being
one large JSON object.

28
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,381
There are not tables, or collections,
or documents like MangoDB.

29
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:35,360
Also Firebase is hosted in the cloud,

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,172
which makes it easier to access data
on any client anywhere in the world.

31
00:01:39,172 --> 00:01:42,650
Finally Firebase gives you complete
control for organizing data and

32
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,970
changing your schema.

33
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:49,130
This offers amazing flexibility and
is great for prototyping applications.

34
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,390
>> So Lila while it is possible to build
a collaborative mobile applications with

35
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,840
either Oracle or
Parse it takes additional planning and

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,150
requires additional integration
with third party services.

37
00:01:58,255 --> 00:02:00,830
Firebase implementation is
designed from the ground up for

38
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,950
real time and collaborative applications
like Shopping List Plus Plus.
