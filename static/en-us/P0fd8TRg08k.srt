Before we describe the theory as to why this is the case, can you think of any

2
00:00:04,126 --> 00:00:10,008
situations that you've experienced where you saw this bystander effect? That

3
00:00:10,008 --> 00:00:13,016
is, have you been in a situation where somebody really needed help, and there

4
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:18,190
are a bunch of people around and nobody did help? Have you ever been driving

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,190
and noticed a person on the side of the road with a flat tire, or the hood of

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,340
their car open with steam coming out of the engine, and just drove by without

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,617
stopping to help? Perhaps as you were driving you saw the person and thought,

00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:34,312
well somebody must have called to help that person. I'm not the only person who

9
00:00:34,312 --> 00:00:38,605
saw that person needed assistance. Somebody must've called for help. So my

10
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:43,114
question then, can you think of any situation that you've experienced? This

00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:45,339
would be a great time to share it on the forum.
