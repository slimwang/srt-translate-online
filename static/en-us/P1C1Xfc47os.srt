1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,500
The second case is simliar to the common case,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,620
but the memory pressure on P is exacerbated in

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,109
this case. In this case, there's so much memory

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,570
pressure that all of the physical memory that's available at

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,320
P is being consumed by the working set, while

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,300
hosting all the applications running on host P. There's

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,390
no community service happening on host P. And now,

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,040
if there is another page fault, for some new page

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,940
on P, then there is no other option on

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,840
host P except to throw out some page from its

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,348
current working set in order to make room for

12
00:00:36,348 --> 00:00:39,780
this missing page. So, we're going to do exactly similar

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,660
to what we did in the previous case, with

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,510
the only difference that the candidate that is being chosen

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,100
as a victim, or the replacement candidate, which is

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,750
called a victim, in the management of virtual memory system,

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,790
is coming from the local part of host P itself. So we get the missing page

18
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,240
and we send out the oldest page from

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,820
local part of host P, recognizing that the local

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,280
part is zero right now. So in this case you can see that there is no change

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,180
in the distribution of local and global on

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,940
P, because global is already zero, it's not going

23
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,360
to be anything less than that. So the

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,970
distribution remains unchanged. And as in the previous case,

25
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,100
there's no change on host Q as well

26
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,510
in terms of the split between local and global.
