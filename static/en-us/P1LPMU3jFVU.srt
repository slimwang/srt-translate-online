The answer is, you can't construct an interface type. We know this can't be the

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,404
answer because we have assigned objects of certain classes to variables of

3
00:00:08,404 --> 00:00:13,092
interface types. In the example before this, you saw code that created new dogs

4
00:00:13,092 --> 00:00:16,212
and then put them in drawable variable or added them to lists of drawable

5
00:00:16,212 --> 00:00:22,358
items. So this statement is false. This statement is true, but doesn't apply in

6
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:27,942
this case. I can only put an object into a variable with an interface type if

7
00:00:27,942 --> 00:00:33,602
the object is of a class that implements the interface. Like in this case. But

8
00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:38,486
if the dog class didn't implement the drawable interface, I wouldn't be able to

9
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:43,070
do this. If you're not quite sure why you can't construct an interface type,

10
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,330
let's look at the code. This is the code for a dog. It has all of the

11
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,412
information on how to move and how to draw. The drawable interface has almost

12
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:55,160
no information at all. If you tried to make a new drawable, it would know that

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,339
it should know how to draw. But wouldn't know how to draw. That's why Java

14
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:02,527
won't let you construct a drawable.
