1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,590
So what will actually happen is if you
try to insert a duplicate value into

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:08,180
a primary key column, the database
will signal an error, in Python code,

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,280
you'll see that as an exception.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,730
If your code does that using cycle PG,

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,050
you'll have to roll back using the roll
back method on your database connection,

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,990
before you can do more with
that database connection.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,080
So the correct answer is that
the database will signal an error.
