00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,420
Earlier in this course, we've used
Joins to derive new tables, from two or

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,090
more existing tables.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,680
But there are also cases, where you
want to join a table to it's self.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,530
For instance to find pairs of entries
that have something in common.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,110
Doing this in the database is generally
a lot faster than pulling that data in

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,510
to your python code and
scanning it there.

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,890
Here is an example.

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,620
This is a table of students living,
in the residence halls of a college.

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,280
Student ID is the primary key,

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,210
and then we have the name of the
residence building and the room number.

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,420
These are actually some of the names
of dormitories at my college.

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,570
Now suppose, we want to find out
which students are roommates.

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,410
In other words they live in the same
building, and have the same room number.

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,780
Joining the table to
itself is how we do this.

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,850
This exact query isn't quite right,
but it's close.

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,810
Try it out on the next page,
then see if you can fix it.
