00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,240
I've opened dev tools, and

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,330
I'll start my investigation by
taking a look at their actual sizes.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,600
Looks like the first image
is 1000 x 667 pixels, and

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,290
the second image is
also 1000 x 667 pixels.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,270
So at least their
resolutions are the same.

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,760
In the network tab, it becomes pretty
clear that they have different

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,970
compression levels, because the first
image has a size of about 60 KB.

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,150
While the second is only around 40 KB.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,640
And both images pretty much look the
same so that's a lot of wasted bytes.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,370
Saving with quality set to high can
be even more of a problem on mobile

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,090
where bandwidth is scarce and
the screens are small.

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,310
Later in the course, you'll learn
how to serve different images for

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,030
displays of different sizes and
different resolutions.
