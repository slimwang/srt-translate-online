1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The correct answer is sometimes. There are actually cases where we can do this.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's not always possible because, as we learned before,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the camera doesn't really record the distance.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If we look into an arbitrary scene, we normally can't recover the depth from a single image.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But in certain cases it's possible. Here's a dollar bill.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
A dollar bill is a fixed size, and you can know the size. All dollar bills have the same size.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And by understanding the internal projection size of this bill,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
you can actually really recover how far it is away,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
if you know things like focal length and so on.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The answer is yes in cases we know the size of the object

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and no in cases where you don't know the size.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Therefore, sometimes was the correct answer here.
