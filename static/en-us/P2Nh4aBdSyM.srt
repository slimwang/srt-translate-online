1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,690
How many moves did you come up with,
David?

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,310
>> So, I was able to do
the problem in 11 moves.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,270
I won't talk you through
the entire process, but

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,460
if you'd like to pause this
video you can take a look and

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,000
see the exact moves I used,
and see if they match yours.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,340
We know that 11 moves are the most
efficient way to solve the problem, but

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,650
these aren't the only 11 moves that
can actually solve the problem.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,910
>> Good, David.
That's the correct answer.

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,360
So now that we have solved
this problem together,

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,010
next time you go to a cocktail party,
you can entertain all of your guests by

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,040
showing how you can do this problem so
effectively and so efficiently.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,160
Even if all of them flounder trying
to do things on their napkin that's

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,670
not succeeding.

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,200
>> So we've not yet talked about how
an AI method can determine which states

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,340
are productive and
which states are unproductive.

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,440
We'll revisit this issue
in the next couple lessons.
