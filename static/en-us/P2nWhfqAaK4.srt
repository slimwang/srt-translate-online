00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,522
We're finally at the point where you get to do an exercise and do some

2
00:00:02,522 --> 00:00:05,832
programming. To make our ornament, or defensive device to stop the

3
00:00:05,832 --> 00:00:10,053
robo-minotaurs from destroying all things good and just, we need to rotate each

4
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:14,209
cylinder into position. We have all the data we need for a cylinder. The axis of

5
00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:18,824
rotation, the angle of rotation, and the length of the cylinder. First we create

6
00:00:18,824 --> 00:00:23,402
a cylinder. Using the previously computed cylinder length for its height. Here's

7
00:00:23,402 --> 00:00:27,280
the code that actually sets up the access angle rotation matrix. For the axis

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,930
angle rotation function, we need to pass in a normalized axis at an angle in

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:36,518
radiants. This function could normalize the axis itself, just to be safe.

10
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:40,355
However, for efficiency's sake, it doesn't, so we normalize the axis earlier

11
00:00:40,355 --> 00:00:45,960
here. Next we do an obscure thing. Set matrix auto update to false. This

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,810
parameter is true by default. What it means is that, if true then our objects 3D

13
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:55,482
matrix will be computed from its position, rotation and scale parameters. By

14
00:00:55,482 --> 00:01:00,839
setting it to false we tell 3JS that we are not going to use these parameters.

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,676
But rather are going to set the matrix itself directly. And that's exactly what

16
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:10,275
we do in the next line, where we at long last finally call the matrix rotation

17
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:14,829
axis method. Giving it our normalized axis and angle. At long last we have added

18
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:18,951
a cylinder at the proper angle and length to our seam. Now it's your turn to

19
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:24,183
finish off the rest. Add another three cylinders to complete this object.
