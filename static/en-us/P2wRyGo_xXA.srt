Okay, so here we are, back at the code. For now, what

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,689
I will do is, continue to draw the square, but I will comment

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:08,880
the rest of the code out. So, let me go ahead and do

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,570
that. Let me quickly save, and run to make sure everything's running well.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,710
All right, the program still seems to be drawing a

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,390
square, which is good. Now, if you remember the original challenge,

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,720
It was to draw a circle, out of squares. And thus

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,170
far, all you've done is just draw, just the one square.

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,310
So, given that, here's a question for you. How would you've

10
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,020
build on the code that we've written thus far, to draw

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,800
this image. Now, don't worry about writing code right now. All

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,140
I want you to do, is identify in plain simple English,

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,710
the steps you would take to solve this problem. You can submit your answers on

14
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,160
the discussion forum. Once you're done, make

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,860
sure you check this box before you continue.
