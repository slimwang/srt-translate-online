00:00:00,672 --> 00:00:03,167
Responsive design, I know.

2
00:00:03,167 --> 00:00:07,728
It's fun to resize your web browser 
and see which sites resize gracefully,

3
00:00:07,728 --> 00:00:12,480
and which sites remain defiantly large 
with gross horizontal scroll bars.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,568
But responsive design 
is not just for the web.

5
00:00:15,568 --> 00:00:19,395
Today, the lines between phones 
and tablets are disappearing.

6
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:22,158
So it's important to think about how 
your UI will scale

7
00:00:22,158 --> 00:00:24,181
in our multiscreen world.

8
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:27,685
Don't be overwhelmed. 
Just like designing responsive layouts

9
00:00:27,685 --> 00:00:31,280
for the web, build your layouts 
to be reasonably flexible

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,851
or within a common device size.

11
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:37,516
Then you can set break points, 
providing alternative layouts

12
00:00:37,516 --> 00:00:40,414
for those various sizes. 
Think about it this way,

13
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:47,704
small phone, large phone, 
medium tablet, and large tablet.
