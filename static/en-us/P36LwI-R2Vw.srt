00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,410
After drawing conclusions and
thinking predictions,

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,660
the final step of the process
is to communicate your findings.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,140
Now, even though you don't have rigorous
conclusions backed by statistics or

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,990
machine learning, you can certainly
think about how to communicate

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,200
the results of your exploration.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:14,840
At this stage,

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,580
you generally want to decide which
of your findings you think are most

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,740
interesting or most worth sharing, and
how you want to present those findings.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,710
For example, I was interested in
the difference in total minutes spent in

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,270
the classroom between students
who passed the first project and

11
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,770
students who didn't.

12
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,100
And I think the clearest way to present
this is simply to present the means for

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,580
both groups.

14
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,600
I also thought the difference in number
of days visited in the first week

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,350
was interesting.

16
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,740
And then this case,

17
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,640
I thought the histograms did a better
job of showing back numbers.

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,880
If you do want to share
any visualizations,

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,610
in general it's a good idea to
spend some time polishing them.

20
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,200
You want to make them look nicer and

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,370
explain what trends
you'll noticing in them.

22
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,970
You always know what you made a plot of,
but your reader doesn't.
