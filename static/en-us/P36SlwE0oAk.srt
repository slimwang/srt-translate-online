1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's look at another data set reaching x and y, and now I'm going to ask you a different question,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which is the parameter b, is it negative or positive?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Assuming that this is 0, 0, and say this is 10, 10.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I ask you the same for the parameter a. Is this negative of positive?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
In either case choose exactly one answer.
