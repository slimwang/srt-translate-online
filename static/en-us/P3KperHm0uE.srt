1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,900
Another process between them is once I have these multiple images that actually

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,815
have overlaps and everything registered, I need to figure out how to blend them,

3
00:00:08,815 --> 00:00:11,350
crossfade across them, or cut them.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,910
Again, something we will cover in extensive detail in a future lecture.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,360
But here I just want to set the context.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,590
So again, I have all of these images.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,340
Seven images that we've seen before.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,840
Just kind of put them on top of each other and kind of shown them to have

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,630
a little bit of transparency so we can see the overlap amongst all of them.

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,400
Warping has been done, but

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,390
now of course you notice some of the lighting conditions are different.

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,640
This can be done basically by figuring out which pixels from

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,460
which images should be visible.

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,780
What percentage of the mixture of these two pixels be visible?

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,810
Or should I just choose one pixel or set of pixels from one image to the other?

16
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,700
The fade and blend are merging those two images together.

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,450
Cut is choosing which one of the original image pixels do I want to choose.

18
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,290
This basically shows the step, now I can basically merge them and

19
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:04,840
then slowly, see notice that all of the boundaries are gone.

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,470
And this shows a perfectly clean and smooth panorama.

21
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,130
Another simple part, the step 5,

22
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:15,110
is cropping panorama basically just to kind of create a rectangular image again.

23
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,050
Again these are optional.

24
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,630
Sometimes I actually like to see panoramas without the cropping because it

25
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,530
kind of shows a nice transition across different viewpoints.

26
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,500
But this is now a much bigger image.

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,635
Shows the space much nicer.
