00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,019
The answer is no, we don't have enough information, we should make an instance

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,510
variable. The xCoord and yCoord variables are parameters in the constructor.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,735
Which means when the constructor is done running, they go away. So then when

4
00:00:14,735 --> 00:00:20,870
addFriend is called later, xCoord and yCoord don't exist anymore. We can't get

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,110
the coordinates from the friend variable. We're talking about the coordinates

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,140
for where to draw the circle. And the friend probably doesn't know anything

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,630
about where the upper left corner of the current object is. We could take the

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,775
coordinates in as parameters in the addFriend method, so it would be

9
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:44,840
addFriend(Person friend) int x int y. But it would be a little weird if every

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,560
time you called addFriend, you also had to pass in the x and y coordinates that

11
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,310
you originally passed in in the constructor. So if we decide to make instance

12
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,280
variables for x and y, where would we initialize them? That's one for you to

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,860
think about yourself.
