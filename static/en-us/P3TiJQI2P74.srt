1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,490
The answer here is very simple, we have one vertex for each clause.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:11,290
We have 1 * m vertices for the clauses. All other coefficients of this answer here are 0.

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:18,230
The only vertices that we haven't counted yet are A and B, so there's two additional vertices,

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:24,520
and now we know the total number of vertices that we are using here in our graph that is

5
00:00:24,520 --> 99:59:59,999
5n + m + 3 * mn + 2 vertices in total
