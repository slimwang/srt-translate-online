00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,990
Let's jump back into using git.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,660
What makes a git repository a repository?

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,820
Last lesson you interacted with an existing repository,

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,360
the asteroids repository.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,580
For the most part it just looks like a normal directory on your machine.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,905
The only real difference is that git repositories store a bunch of

7
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:19,540
metadata about the history of the repository since it was created.

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,430
We won't go into the details of how exactly this metadata is stored, but

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,840
where is less complicated.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,100
It's right here in the main directory.

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,300
But it's tucked away in a hidden directory.

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,890
Meaning that it doesn't show up in most file explorers by default.

13
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,930
Hidden files and directories are often used for

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,730
data that the user doesn't need to directly interact with.

15
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,630
These directories and files are only different from normal ones in that they

16
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,580
start with a period which tells the operating system to hide it from the users.

17
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,670
One way to see these files is by going to the command line and using ls -a.

18
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,230
In addition to all the normal files that you see when you type ls,

19
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,270
when you do ls -a, you also see the hidden files.

20
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,060
See, here, you have .git.

21
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,060
So, how does this hidden .git directory even get there?

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,256
Last time you cloned an existing repository,

23
00:01:02,256 --> 00:01:05,440
which transferred all that metadata over to your computer.

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,660
If you want to start from scratch,

25
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,500
you'll need to explicitly tell git that you want to make a new repository.

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,070
In the next video Caroline will show you how that works.
