00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,448
Here's our last practice problem for the lesson. What do you think would be the

2
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:07,946
solution for this radical equation? Write your answer as a set, or if there's

3
00:00:07,946 --> 00:00:12,360
no solution, type NS as usual. And, just like our last problem, we have a

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,283
number in front of our radical. So be sure you square this number when you

5
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:17,130
solve.
