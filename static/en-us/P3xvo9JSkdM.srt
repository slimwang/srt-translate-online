00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,910
So let's see what happens when we try an example on this. I'm going to give you

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,600
a paragraph describing a small program for counting the number of leaves on

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,775
a tree. A tree is a data structure consisting of nodes connected by directed

4
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:18,390
arcs, in which occurs a single root node from which all other nodes descend.

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,800
Nodes without outgoing arcs are called leaves, and the intent of the program is

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,930
to count the number of leaves in a given tree. Here's the paragraph description.

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,180
So counting tree nodes, keep a pile of the parts of the tree that have not yet

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,260
been counted, initially get a tree and put it on an, the empty pile.

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,110
The count of leaves is initially set to zero. As long as the pile is not empty,

10
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,530
repeatedly take a tree off the pile and examine it. If the tree consists of

11
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,000
a single leaf, then increment the leaf counter and throw away that tree.

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,200
If the tree is not a single leaf but instead consists of two subtrees,

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,750
split the tree into its left and right subtrees and put them back on the pile.

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,510
Once the pile is empty, display the count of the leaves. Okay, step one,

15
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,100
go through the description and underline all the nouns, see what you get.
