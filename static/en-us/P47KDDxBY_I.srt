00:00:02,998 --> 00:00:04,954
Welcome to your first day.

3
00:00:04,954 --> 00:00:08,010
I'm Kelly, and I'll be your
mentor as you get settled in.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,405
That means I'll be assigning you
projects, giving feedback and

5
00:00:11,405 --> 00:00:13,883
connecting you to
the resources that you need.

6
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:17,006
I was in your shoes when I joined
the company a few years ago,

7
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:19,272
and I know the first
few weeks can be tough.

8
00:00:19,272 --> 00:00:21,961
But don't worry,
I'll be with you every step of the way.

9
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:23,446
Come, I'll show you your desk.

11
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:30,097
Thanks for joining me, so
we've been pretty busy lately.

12
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:33,330
One of the reason we've had so much work
is that we specialize in a certain type

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,410
of analytics,
called predictive analytics.

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,550
It's all about finding trends and

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,690
patterns in existing data to help
make predictions about the future.

16
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,260
Tons of companies are using
predictive analytics to make

17
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,290
better decisions about marketing,
production, finance, really anything.

18
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,400
Check out this recent project we did.

19
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,990
Our client was a manufacturing firm, and

20
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,840
they were losing a bunch of money,
because of unexpected machine failures.

21
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,723
We worked with them to predict
when the machines might fail,

22
00:01:01,723 --> 00:01:03,712
so they could do
the repairs before hand.

23
00:01:03,712 --> 00:01:08,184
They ended up reducing the impact
of machine failure by over 40%.

24
00:01:08,184 --> 00:01:10,695
And now they've hired us
to some more projects.

25
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,405
[SOUND] Come in.

26
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:12,955
&gt;&gt; Here you go.

27
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:14,142
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you, sir.

28
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:16,190
&gt;&gt; No problem.

29
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,047
&gt;&gt; Our manager thought this
would be a great project for

30
00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:19,490
you to get started with.

31
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,566
I'm excited to see you
what you'll do with it.

32
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:24,203
It'll give you a good idea of
the process we go through while working

33
00:01:24,203 --> 00:01:25,520
on projects.

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,060
After you turn it in I'll
give you some feedback.

35
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,050
And don't worry about
this project too much.

36
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,597
Think of it as your warm up.

37
00:01:31,597 --> 00:01:32,713
You ready to get started?

38
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:33,213
