1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The original question was--does she have a vertex cover of size at most k

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,039
and this first part is a different way of saying exactly that.

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,140
So at most, k vertices are needed to cover all the edges.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:21,400
However, what this implies is that if there's any vertex does an endpoint to k+1 edges or more,

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:27,100
then it must be in the cover because otherwise we would require more than k vertices

6
00:00:27,100 --> 99:59:59,999
to cover all the edges, which is not the same as the original question that we are asking.
