00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,731
Since we know that taking an even root of an equation creates a positive and a

2
00:00:03,731 --> 00:00:09,160
negative result, we need to be able to enter this new sign, this plus or minus.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,962
Luckily Math Quill has a way for us to do that. To enter this plus or minus

4
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:17,771
sign, you want to type in a backslash, and then the letters p and m. Of course,

5
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:21,321
p and m here stands for plus or minus. But like most things in math quill, we

6
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:26,134
also need to enter a space in order for this symbol to appear. Try typing these

7
00:00:26,134 --> 00:00:30,075
first two expressions using the keystrokes on the screen. And then see if you

8
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:34,260
can figure out these last two. Keep learning, and good luck.
