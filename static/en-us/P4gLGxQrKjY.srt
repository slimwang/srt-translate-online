1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,915
So, let's redraw this sampling distribution. So, if this is the mean of the

2
00:00:04,915 --> 00:00:09,137
population which is the same as the mean of the distribution of sample means.

3
00:00:09,137 --> 00:00:14,873
And let's say this is two standard deviations away from the mean which is the

4
00:00:14,873 --> 00:00:20,952
same as the mean plus 2 times the standard error. And this value here is the

5
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:29,562
mean minus 2 times the standard error. Now, 95% are between these two values.

6
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:36,395
So, getting back to this example, 95% of means are within two of these standard

7
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:43,328
deviations on either side of the population mean. This distance, 2 times the

8
00:00:43,328 --> 00:00:48,690
population standard deviation divided by root n, is called the margin of error.

9
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,346
So now, what does that tell us about this value of 40? If everyone started using

10
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:58,107
the Bieber Tweeter, we're guessing that there'd be a new population distribution

11
00:00:58,107 --> 00:01:03,970
of Klout scores, but we don't know what it would be. But we do know that one of

12
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:10,528
the samples of size 35 has a mean of 40. Now, if 95% of sample means are within

13
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:16,528
2 times the standard error, then this mean value has a 95% chance of being

14
00:01:16,528 --> 00:01:23,128
within 2 times the standard error of this new population mean, if everyone used

15
00:01:23,128 --> 00:01:24,829
the Bieber Tweeter.
