00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,310
Welcome to Elementary Statistics.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,059
We're really excited
to have you on board.

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,700
My name's Katie and

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,300
I'm the one who will be explaining most
of the concepts throughout this course.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,640
I'll also be doing a lot of drawing and

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,329
a lot of writing to help you understand
the content as much as possible.

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,690
in each of the sixteen
lessons in this course,

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,980
you'll learn new methods to describe and
analyze data.

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,730
Each lesson builds on
the concepts you learned before.

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,640
So as you progress through the course,

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,260
try to get a good grasp of
the material before moving on.

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,250
But if it turns out you need a review,
no big deal.

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,900
You can easily go back and rewatch
the videos and redo the exercises.

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,180
What do I mean by exercises?

15
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,920
Each lesson consists of short
instructional videos where I explain

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,500
cool stat stuff and guide your thinking.

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,840
But we want you to make
breakthroughs on your own.

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,000
So instead of just telling you a fact or
formula, I'll ask a quiz.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,570
A quiz or exercise, same thing,
is not there for us to judge you or

20
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,830
to impact your grade.

21
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,860
It's there for your own benefit,
to make you think.

22
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,390
At Udacity, we believe that the chance
to think about something from your

23
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,460
own unique perspective is
a powerful learning opportunity.
