1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,820
You probably agree that opt-in with
patient specified restrictions

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,100
is the most attractive
privacy consent model.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,470
But how do you actually manage it?

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:16,129
How do patients indicate what data
they want to share or not share?

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,790
Providing a mechanism is
the data segmentation problem.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,100
Suppose for
example a patient had hypertension and

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,820
depression among their medical problems.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,810
Their hypertension is
not well controlled and

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,090
they have undesirable side effects
from the drugs prescribed to treat it.

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,330
So they're interested in joining
a clinical trial for a new and

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,469
promising medication.

12
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,300
As a result,

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,000
they want to share the hypertension part
of their data to apply for the trial.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,330
But they are sensitive
about their depression and

15
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,430
wish to restrict access to that data.

16
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,305
How do they specify that?

17
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:57,832
The solution is easier if someone with
clinical expertise and their trust,

18
00:00:57,832 --> 00:01:01,430
such as their physician,
does it for them.

19
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,970
But suppose the patient has their
record in a PHR and wants to apply for

20
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,080
the trial themselves.

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,250
Presented with a list of their own
medications, they may not recognize

22
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,810
the names or know for
sure which ones are for what condition.

23
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,990
That form of sharing would be
greatly facilitated if their PHR or

24
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,490
EMR understood these
clinical relationships.

25
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,576
Here's a simple depiction of just
such a record for our hypothetical

26
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:31,091
patient from Dr. Jonathan Nebeker at
the University of Utah in the Utah VA.

27
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:35,193
Given this underlying
representation of relationships,

28
00:01:35,193 --> 00:01:38,802
the patients could simply
click on hypertension and

29
00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:42,739
see the related medications
with the others greyed out,

30
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:48,495
greatly facilitating the opt-in with
patient-specified restrictions model.
