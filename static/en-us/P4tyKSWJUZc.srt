00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,602
Now lets calculate the t statistic, which is the observed mean difference minus

00:00:04,602 --> 00:00:10,760
the expected mean difference divided by the standard error. Remember that our

00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,810
expected difference is zero, but it can be anything. What's the t statistic?
