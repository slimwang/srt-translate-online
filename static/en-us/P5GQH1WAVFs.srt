00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,480
Let's start off by looking at two important

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,750
data relationships when you do modeling in data

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:10,480
store. They are ancestor relationships and has-a relationships.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,960
Starting off with the ancestor relationship in data store

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,190
it is possible to specify that an entity

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,970
has an ancestor entity. There are two important

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,180
rules for ancestor relationships. First of all, it

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,620
needs to be assigned when the entity is created.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,860
And secondly it can never be changed so

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,060
those are things to think about when you model

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,960
an ancestor relationship. And given those rules, please note

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,860
that the ancestor relationship is not the same as

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,900
the is-a relationship in object oriented modeling. In conference

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,790
central, we will use the ancestor relationship for the

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,130
conference kind that you will create shortly. Where the

16
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,030
ancestor will be the user who created the conference.

17
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,270
Technically speaking though since the users are identified

18
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,720
through their profile entities, so in this case the

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,740
conferences will have the key of the profile

20
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,120
entity as their ancestor key. The other relationship we

21
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,770
will be using is the has-a relationship. We

22
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,020
will be using this relationship to model conferences which

23
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,560
users are attending. To do this we will

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,460
add a property to the profile entity which specifies

25
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,150
the attended conferences. So each profile will have

26
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,970
a property that contains the conferences that they are

27
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,128
attending, observe that this relationship can easily change.

28
00:01:29,128 --> 00:01:32,040
We can deregister from conferences and register to new

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,000
ones, so it is not bounded by the

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,570
strict rules of the ancestor relationship. So those are

31
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,010
the basics of these relationships and that's also

32
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,330
enough theory for now. Time to do some coding.
