00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,690
In this lesson we'll look at Jellyfish,

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,310
a technique to network data centers randomly.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,180
The goals of Jellyfish are to achieve

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,960
high throughput to support, for example, big data

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,260
analytics or agile placement of virtual machines

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,070
and incremental expandability, so that network operators can

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,230
easily add or replace servers and switches.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,470
For example, large companies like Facebook are adding

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,020
capacity on a daily basis. Commercial products

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,550
make it easy to expand or provision servers

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,890
in response to changing traffic load but

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,726
not the network. Unfortunately, the structure of the

13
00:00:38,726 --> 00:00:42,690
data center networks constrains expansion. Structures such

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,950
as a hypercube require two to the K

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,630
switches, where K is the number of

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,790
servers. Even more efficient topologies, like a FAT

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,460
tree, are still quadratic in the number of servers.
