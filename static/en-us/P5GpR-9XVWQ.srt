1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,719
Okay. So, lets start with the joint probability.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,120
Now since A and B are both dependent

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,330
on each other, there are only two possibilities.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,802
Both can be heads or both can be

5
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:14,628
tail, tails. So the joint probability is also 0.5. What

6
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:19,620
is the, what is the conditional probability? Conditional probability is given as

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,165
probability of A comma B upon probability of B. So,

8
00:00:25,165 --> 00:00:28,530
conditional probability is 1. Now, what is the entropy

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,100
of A? It is similar to the last example, because

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,570
we are still using fair coins. So, the entropy of

11
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,080
A is 1. Entropy of B is also 1. What

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,570
is the joint entropy between A and B? Okay. Let's

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,380
use this formula, and see if our answer changes. Okay,

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,190
the joint entropy comes out to be 1, which is

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,220
different than our last example. What is the conditional entropy?

16
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,560
The conditional entropy is given by this formula. Let's substitute

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,510
the values to find out what we get. Okay, the conditional

18
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,973
entropy comes out to be 0. What is a mutual

19
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:04,665
information between A and B, then subtract the entropy of A,

20
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:07,718
and the conditional entropy of A given 0, which is

21
00:01:07,718 --> 00:01:10,560
1 minus 0, which is 1. So the, so the mutual

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,710
information in this case is 1, while in the previous

23
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,310
case, it was 0. So since these coins are dependent on

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,110
each other, the random variable A gives us some information about

25
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,100
the random variable B. This tells you, how mutual information works.
