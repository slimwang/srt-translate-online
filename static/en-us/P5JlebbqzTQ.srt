Hi, I'm Cameron Pitman, and welcome to the class on AJAX requests.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,570
Let's imagine that you want to visit a website.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,760
When you type in the name of the website into your browser and

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,780
press Enter, what do you expect to happen?

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,560
The exact answer, of course, depends on the website.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,530
But it's safe to say that you expect to see,

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,160
well, something, some website, to show up very quickly.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,790
And have you noticed how

9
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,220
the next page button has mostly disappeared from the Internet?

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,160
Modern websites can load content without reloading.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,180
Developers have solved the challenge of loading information quickly and

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,750
after the first page render in many ways.

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,297
And one flexible and popular implementation relies on AJAX requests,

14
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:39,971
which allow for data to be received asynchronously.

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,950
Data that loads asynchronously can be requested late in the load process and

16
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,350
the website should load acceptably with or without it.

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,520
As part of this class, you'll be building a move planner app.

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,200
You know what?

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,850
Let's take a look at it.
