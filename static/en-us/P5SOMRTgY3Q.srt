00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,270
Welcome to the class.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,330
We feel this course will be very beneficial for aspiring and

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,170
practicing data scientists in industry and in academia.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,960
>> In this class, we will learn how to build and validate models.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,050
Many of you may have already taken a course in machine learning or

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,269
data science, and may already be familiar with machine learning models.

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,840
In this course, we will take a more general approach, walking through

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,760
the questioning, modeling and validation steps of the model-building process.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,030
Now, the goal is to get you to practice thinking in depth about a problem and

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,900
coming up with your own solutions.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,620
Many examples we will attempt may not have a one correct answer, but

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,230
will require you to work through the problem,

13
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,360
applying the methods that we hope to illustrate throughout this class.

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,320
>> It is somewhat like a game of chess.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,040
The rules are quite well-defined, but one needs to have a strategy for winning.

16
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,330
In any given situation, there may be multiple correct moves leading you to

17
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,770
victory and numerous incorrect ones.

18
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,360
It is to study and practice.

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,110
You learn the strategies for winning.

20
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,230
>> At the end of this class, you will feel confident in your ability to

21
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,860
conquer new problems by applying an iterative process of analysis that takes you

22
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,770
from a vague initial question to a rigorous model addressing it and

23
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,330
quantifying the uncertainty that exists in any model.

24
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,530
In addition, you might learn about new types of models to apply to problems, and

25
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,590
you will learn how to use the best model for

26
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,400
the task that takes the most advantage of data instead of

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,650
applying one black box model after another and hoping for the best.

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,830
But before all of that, let's get to know each other.
