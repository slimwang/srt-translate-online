1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,370
We have an awesome course planned for you.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,650
>> We're going to facilitate learning and discussion on

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,790
different biological concepts, as well as some social issues.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,520
>> But before we jump in, we want to take a brief moment

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,600
to mention our course expectations for you, as well as give you

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,700
a little orientation on how to interact with us here. Now first

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,230
and foremost this course is going to require a time commitment. So, be prepared.

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,490
>> But the joy of online learning means you

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,800
can take the course however you're the most confortable.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,610
>> Hey guys.

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,480
What you want to do tonight? Oh, sure. We can do class.

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,810
>> no. I'm actually working.

13
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,370
>> This course is 12 lessons long. And each lesson is going to vary in the

14
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,600
time commitment required, and level of difficulty.

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,302
And that brings us to our second expectation:

16
00:00:42,302 --> 00:00:43,608
[CROSSTALK]

17
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:44,814
Interactions.

18
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:45,720
[SOUND]

19
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,740
You may think that our lessons are confined to this video screen.

20
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,220
But in reality you can interact with us through this screen too.

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,310
>> Stopping to think and answering

22
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,280
questions can really facilitate future learning.

23
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,030
We want you to click to respond or type in a short response.

24
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,160
>> Now, it's important for you to remember that these interactions are

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,890
not graded. We want you to think of these as learning opportunities.

26
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,970
>> Now, if anything's

27
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,810
unclear, check out the solution video for help. Or

28
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,410
you can go back and re-watch videos. For example, we

29
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,980
might ask who are the coolest genome guides ever?

30
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,960
Go ahead and pick which answer you think is best.
