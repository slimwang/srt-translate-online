00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,390
Now that you've seen how
classes are built in Swift, so

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,870
many new possibilities
will open up to you.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,750
These are the moving parts that
will make your application tick.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,060
This is a turning point.

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,890
So be sure to take the time
to master these concepts and

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,270
complete the exercises on classes,
properties and methods.

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,990
Next up enum's and structs.
