00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,010
In this session,
we've gone from thinking about data and

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:07,510
method separately, to thinking about
data and methods as packaged units.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,140
The concept of objects
representing packages of data and

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,120
functionality is essential to
object oriented programming.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,379
And it will be a central
theme moving forward.

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,450
See you in the next session.
