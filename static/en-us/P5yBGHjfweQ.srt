00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,200
Here are the two models we've been looking at, and I'd like to know what each

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,470
of them estimates the world population would be by the year 2100. One of them

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,080
is going to give us a lower estimate, and one of them is going to give us an

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,820
upper estimate. So please tell me what each of those are. Once you figured out

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,100
those numbers, I'd like you to tell me which estimate you think is more

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,060
accurate and why. Or maybe both are inaccurate. Think about where the data that

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,410
created each model came from.
