00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,390
Things need to be fast when you're
interreading on a website or app.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,380
So if you change a line and
reload the page,

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,860
you really want to see
those changes instantly.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,070
And disrupting that flow is a no-go.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,520
So make sure your actual build time
never goes beyond a few seconds.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,350
Build tools are pretty
useless by themselves.

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,110
You either need to write a lot of
custom code or rely on plugins.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,000
So make sure to pick one that
has the plugins you need.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,630
Individually contained task allow you
to easily enable and disable certain

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,090
steps of your build process, and
they're important prerequisite.

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,910
There is no point in saving bytes
when writing server-side code.

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,280
The important bit is that you understand
what the configuration of your build

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,460
system does,
not how short the notation is.
