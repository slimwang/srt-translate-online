00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,950
Let's start off by
going to our settings.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,290
We'll go to accessibility,
click on voiceover,

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,490
and then I'll turn
the voiceover switch on.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,440
>> Voiceover on, settings,
accessibility, back button.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,580
>> And I can swipe.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,680
>> Voiceover heading.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,370
Voiceover, on.

8
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,770
>> And that'll advance voiceover.

9
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:15,790
>> Double tap to toggle setting.

10
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:20,090
>> Double tapping on the home button,
I can switch to the accessibility blog.

11
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,360
>> Active Chrome, active.

12
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,270
And from here I can swipe
to select different items.

13
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,360
>> New features.

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,301
Press link the accessibility blog.

15
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:31,832
A sample blog to help teach
accessibility topics.

16
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,640
A sample blog post, heavy level too.

17
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,910
>> And when I find something I want
to click on I can just double tap.
