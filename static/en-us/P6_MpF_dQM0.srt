1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,560
We just saw a simplified
explanation of direct.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,450
Here we see essentially the same thing,
but in the more likely and

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,745
more complicated case where Dr.

4
00:00:09,745 --> 00:00:13,775
Johnson and Dr.
Jones are connected to separate HISPs.

5
00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:17,495
Here, S/MIME is used to
encrypt the attachment

6
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:19,485
containing the patient record.

7
00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:24,870
SMTP is used to send secure email from
an email client like Microsoft Outlook.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,860
HTTP/S is used for
sending web mail, like Google Mail.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,190
The sender's HISP can discover or
find the recipient provider's X.509

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:41,150
certificate, their public key,
using DNS or

11
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,940
LDAP, two technologies for managing
distributed resources over a network.

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,590
Once it has the recipient's public key,

13
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,110
the sender's HISP uses it
to encrypt the message.

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,150
It them uses SMTP to send the message to
the recipients HISP having used DNS or

15
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:03,150
LDAP again to find that HISP based
on the recipient's email address.

16
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,180
The recipient's HISP
decrypts the message

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,730
using the recipient's private key,

18
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,640
which is normally stored in the HISP as
a service to its registered providers.

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,760
The recipient then retrieves
the message like any email, but

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,380
using the secure versions of
either Post Office Protocol, POP,

21
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,830
or Internet Message Access Protocol,
IMAP email retrieval.

22
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,190
Which of these could be
a direct attachment?

23
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,730
A fax TIFF file,
scan of a paper document,

24
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,880
a printed version of a chart in
PDF format, or all of the above?
