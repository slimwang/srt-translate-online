00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,520
Although, virtually,
all companies have firewalls in place,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,220
the number of security breaches
continues to increase.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:12,020
The reason for this is that a firewall
is not all things to all malware.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,000
There are some security breaches that
cannot be stopped by a firewall.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,770
Let's do a quiz on firewalls.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,360
Look at this list of items, and check
all those items that firewall can stop.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,030
The first one,
hackers breaking into your system.

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,160
The second one, Internet traffic that
appears to be from a legitimate source.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,820
The third one, viruses and
worms that spread through the Internet.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,210
The fourth one,
spyware being put on your system.

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,100
The fifth one, viruses and
worms that are spread through email.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,510
Check all those items
that a firewall can stop.
