00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,800
A matrix such as this one will be extremely helpful

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,208
when we have even more variables than those in the pseudo-Facebook

3
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,840
data set. Examples arise in many areas, but one that

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,660
has attracted the attention of statisticians is genomic data. In these

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,830
data sets, they're often thousands of genetic measurements for each

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,860
of a small number of samples. In some cases, some of

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,530
these samples have a disease, and so we'd like to identify

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,920
genes that are associated with the disease. In the instructor notes,

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,220
you'll find a data set of gene expression in tumors. The

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,980
data contains the expression of 6,830 genes, compared with a larger

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,590
baseline reference sample. Now, this is a ton of data. So

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,060
let's go ahead and read in the data set, and then

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,180
I'll change the color names of the data set to be

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,830
the numbers from one to 64. Now, I'm just doing this

15
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,740
so that way the plot that I create is going to be

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,270
a little bit nicer with the labeling on the x axis.
