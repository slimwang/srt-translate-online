1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,650
Congratulations, you
finished the lesson.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,120
You learned how to use Numpy and
Pandas to analyze one-dimensional data

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,310
using code that's cleaner and
runs faster, great job.

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,360
In the next lesson,
you'll build on what you've learned and

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,400
start analyzing two-dimensional data.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:13,950
I'll see you then.
