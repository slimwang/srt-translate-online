00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now let's dig into this notion of parcing states a little bit more.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's say that our grammar is the same simple INT + INT grammar it was from before.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If our current state is E goes to E + dot E,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
how many tokens could we have seen so far in the input?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Remember a token is a terminal like INT or plus.
