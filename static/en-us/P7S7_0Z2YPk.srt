1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:03,680
At this point, you should have your API key for the New York Times.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,973
You're ready to start grabbing some headlines and

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,685
the opening paragraphs to articles.

4
00:00:07,685 --> 00:00:11,586
Your code is going to be going inside the same loadData function as before.

5
00:00:11,586 --> 00:00:18,420
You'll use using the jQuery $.getJSON method to make this AJAX request.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,970
It's your job to write the code that makes the AJAX request.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,220
Once the data has been returned from the AJAX request, you'll need to parse it,

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,220
and then figure out how to present it on the page.

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,650
The link in the instructor notes will take you to the getJSON documentation on

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,320
the jQuery website.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,580
I recommend checking out this first example to get an idea for

12
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,150
what your code should do.

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,480
Let's open up Dev tools and

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,170
inspect this page so you can get an idea of what your HTML should look like.

15
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,850
Opening up the first article, we see that it contains an a tag to a link for

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,150
the article, and

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:53,100
it also contains a p tag with the text of the first paragraph inside.

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,500
In the example, we're passing in a URL string of ajax/test.json.

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,230
This could be any URL.

20
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,270
And, we also pass in an anonymous function.

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,459
This anonymous function,

22
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:09,620
pass to getJSON, will be run when the response returns from the server.

23
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,560
Each article is in a list tag and

24
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,710
they all fall within an unordered list with the ID of nytimes-articles.

25
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,470
I recommend starting off by console.logging the data that gets returned from

26
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,100
this JSON request.

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,720
You'll need to break it apart before you can start building articles.

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,550
So, can you make an AJAX request to the NY Times API and

29
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,530
get some articles about the city?

30
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,770
You'll need to fire off the AJAX request, iterate through the response and

31
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,950
then present articles on the page inside the ul with an id of nytimes-articles.

32
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,920
Check this box when you're done.
