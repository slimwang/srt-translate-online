00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,750
Christian is now going to introduce the final

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,710
project for this class. But a note before he

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:10,340
does. The final project is a digital device,

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,430
something you keep in your pocket, something you work

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,220
by gesture and touch, maybe voice. You might

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,510
wonder, gee, everything in this class has been physical,

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,270
physical products. So, how do the principles we've

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,580
learned in the class apply to this new domain?

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,270
Well that's why we're doing it. We want you to know that all the things you've

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:36,730
learned apply to all products. It doesn't matter whether it's [SOUND] a physical

11
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:42,270
product like this, where the physical affordances are very important. Or

12
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:51,120
to a digital product like this, where gestures and maybe voice and touching

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,040
is very important. All the principles apply

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,820
with maybe different emphasis. So for example,

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,930
with a physical product affordances are important.

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,340
With this, it is the signifiers that

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,410
are critical. Doesn't matter, all the principles

18
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,810
of this course apply to all products,

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,220
perishible, digital, physical.
