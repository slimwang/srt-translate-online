Before we go on let me just ask a simple question here.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,780
I have these two sets of images, pairs of images.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,410
Pair A and pair B.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,680
Which of these two image pairs would be used to make an image panorama?

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,690
Pair A which is shown here?

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,190
Or Pair B?

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,150
Please choose the one, highlight the one that you think is the right one.
