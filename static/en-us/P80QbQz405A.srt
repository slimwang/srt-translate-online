To dig into this issue of similarity between a target problem and

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:08,540
a source case in different domains, let us look at another example.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,070
Let us suppose it is a patient who has a tumor in his stomach.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,910
There is a physician who has a laser gun. She knows that if the laser light were

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,120
to shine on this tumor, the tumor will be killed and the patient will be cured.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,760
But the physician has a problem. The laser light is so

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,910
strong that it will also kill all the healthy tissue on its way to the tumor,

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,660
and thereby killing the patient. What should the physician do?

9
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:36,687
This is actually a very famous problem in cognitive science. It was first used

10
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:41,753
by a psychologist called Don Curry around 1926. What do you think

11
00:00:41,753 --> 00:00:45,522
the physician should do in this situation? Take a moment and think about it.

12
00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:53,481

13
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:54,824
We'll return to the physician and

14
00:00:54,824 --> 00:00:59,200
the patient example in just a minute. First let me tell you another story.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,190
Once there was a kingdom ruled by a ruthless king, there was a rebel

16
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,880
army approaching the fortress in which the king lived. Well there was a problem.

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,340
The kings' men had mined, all the roads approaching the fort.

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,540
As a result, if an army was to walk over the roads, the mines would go off, and

19
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,300
the soldiers would be killed. So what did the army decide to do?

20
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,500
The army decided to decompose itself into smaller groups, so that each

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,800
group could come from a different road, and reach the fort at the same time.

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,260
Because each group was small enough, the mines on the roads did not go off.

23
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,395
The soldiers were able to attack the fort at the same time and

24
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:41,050
overthrow the bad king. Now let's go back to the problem of the physician and

25
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:46,280
the patient. What do you think now? Has the answer to the problem changed?

26
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,830
Some of you indeed may have changed your answer because of this story I

27
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:54,350
told you about the king and the rebel army. One solution to this problem is

28
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,830
that a physician would divide a very intense laser beam into several smaller,

29
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,020
less intense beams. As these beams come from different directions, they do

30
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,460
not harm the healthy tissue. However, they reach the tumor at the same time and

31
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,324
manage to kill the tumor. You will note that this is an example of

32
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:15,170
cross-domain analogy. Here the target problem had to do with the physician and

33
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:20,205
the patient. The source case had to do with the king and the rebel army.

34
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:23,530
The objects in these two situations were clearly very different.

35
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,260
In one case we had a physician and the patient, the laser beam and the tumor.

36
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,790
And in the other case we had the king and the rebel army, the fort and

37
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,790
the mines. Some of the relationships were very similar.

38
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,280
In capturing the fort case, we had a resource, the army, which was decomposed

39
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,086
into several small armies, which was sent to the goal location at the same time.

40
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:50,110
We took this battle, we took this strategy, abstracted it out,

41
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,660
and then applied it to the patient and physician example. A physician used

42
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,405
the same strategy. Resource decomposes into several smaller resources, and

43
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:03,100
sent to the goal at the same time. Now you can also see why the ant climbing

44
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,296
a wall is similar to a woman climbing a ladder. The objects are different,

45
00:03:08,296 --> 00:03:13,590
ant and wall, woman, and ladder, but the relationship is similar. Climbing up.

46
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,040
The cross-domain analogy is then, the objects and the features and the values of

47
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,580
the objects can be different. The similarity is based on the relationship.

48
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,320
It is the relationship that is important. It is the relationship that

49
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,240
gets transferred from the source case to the target problem.
