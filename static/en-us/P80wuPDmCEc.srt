1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,930
>> Okay Michael, what did you come up with?

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:05,920
>> I have a bunch. Well, so, the big advantage of ICR, RCA, it's cheap.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,960
>> It is cheap.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,000
>> It's simple.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,280
>> It is simple.

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,860
>> It's easy.

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,650
>> It is easy, in a sort of comical or complexity sense.

8
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,210
>> Sort of practically free. Those are all

9
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,170
words like, free, easy. Those are, those are

10
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,340
the words that came to mind. You're saying

11
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,890
that that's, none of those is your word.

12
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,350
>> No, none of those was the word that I was coming up with.

13
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,140
>> How about, works?

14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,790
>> No.

15
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,560
>> It did start with the letter f, though.

16
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,564
>> Famous.

17
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:31,236
>> No.

18
00:00:31,236 --> 00:00:34,911
>> Foul mouthed.

19
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:36,280
>> That's two words.

20
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,480
>> Friendly.

21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,180
>> No.

22
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,910
>> Alright, I need more letters. I'm

23
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,740
still going back to famous. Fabulous. Fast.

24
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,380
>> That's right, it's fast. But I would

25
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,970
give you, definitely give you cheap or easy.

26
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,140
>> Cheap

27
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:52,860
is like fast.

28
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,970
>> So is easy.

29
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:56,550
>> [LAUGH] Alright.

30
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,770
>> [LAUGH] At least your, that's what the slang term meant

31
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,260
where I grew up. Anyway, okay, so anything that captures fast,

32
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,400
cheap, easy, whatever would do here. But what's irritating about this

33
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,260
and actually things like k means and k and n and

34
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,500
a whole bunch of other algorithms, is that they're so freaking

35
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,730
simple, and yet they manage to work. And that can be

36
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,790
kind of annoying sometimes because, you know, as machine learning people,

37
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,030
we want to come up with these complex things that work,

38
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,990
but as a very brilliant man once said to me,

39
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,430
you must earn your complexity. So, RCA, randomized components analysis,

40
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,710
or really randomized projections, has this very simple way of

41
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,780
thinking about the world. I'll just randomly throw things together,

42
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,570
and it turns out to pick up correlations on the

43
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,840
way and worked pretty well. And its big advantage, other

44
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,350
than working sometimes, is that it's very, very fast. PCA

45
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,130
can take hours in supercomputers, and ICA can take hours upon

46
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,330
hours in even more supercomputers. But

47
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,290
generating a bunch of random numbers, computers

48
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,830
are really good at that, and it happens to go really, really fast.
