1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,740
So adding colors wouldn't increase the latency, but it would

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,450
increase the bandwidth. What bandwidth means, is the amount of information

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,630
that can be transmitted per unit time. And it doesn't matter

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,860
if there's a start-up time. Right, the start-up time is the

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,890
latency. That's how long it takes to start sending a

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,230
message across. That's how long it takes for the start of

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,620
the message to be received. The bandwidth is, once you've got

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,364
some part of the message across, what's the rate that you

9
00:00:25,364 --> 00:00:28,610
can send information? So, this is going to be measured

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,160
in terms of units of information divided by units

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,320
of time. So bandwidth could be measured in terms

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,120
of bits per second. On the Internet this is

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,110
often measured In Mbps, which is megabits per second

14
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,140
or million bits per second. I haven't yet explained

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,560
what a bit is, and in order to understand

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,938
information, it's important to understand what a bit is.
