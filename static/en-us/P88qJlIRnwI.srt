1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] And the answer is yes in both cases.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
There is a linear separation that

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
goes along here that separates the positive class from the negative class,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and it's been shown in the 60s,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
field perceptron algorithm always

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
converges after finally many steps

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
if such linear separator exists.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm not going to prove this, and I did prove this

9
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in class, but I clearly said this in class.
