00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,400
An important question
here is what is risk?

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,810
So let's take a look at that in
the context of a particular stock.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,830
So here's how the price
of a particular stock,

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,780
let's call it XYZ,
has changed over time.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,860
So over this time period
it's gone up say about 10%.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:25,190
Here's now another stock that
over the same period of time,

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:30,070
it ends up, it's gone up about
the same amount, also ten percent,

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,860
but notice how the volatility
of ABC is much less than XYZ.

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,770
And this volatility is
one measure of risk, and

10
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:47,330
it's the measure of risk typically
used in the finance world.

11
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:52,056
So consider for example here for XYZ,

12
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:56,349
we see this large excursion here.

13
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:59,547
And all along its timeline,
it's been quite volatile.

14
00:00:59,547 --> 00:01:04,705
So that excursion is a measure of risk,
and if we look at it

15
00:01:04,705 --> 00:01:10,200
similarly for ABC,
we see the excursion is much lower.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,920
So the specific metric that finance
folks use for this is that risk is

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,380
essentially the standard
deviation of daily returns.

18
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:25,800
So to calculate risk we would calculate
the daily returns for each one of these

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,610
stocks, take its standard deviation,
and that's our measure of risk.

20
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,600
And we can compare that
one stock to another.
