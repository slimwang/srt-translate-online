00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,370
This quiz will see if you understand execution time

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,770
well enough to make some predictions. So, here's the

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,320
code we had before that times the execution of

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,180
evaluating a Python expression that we pass in as

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,740
code. And we've defined spin loop as a while

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,390
loop that goes through a loop that just adds

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,660
one the number of times of the variable passed

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,090
in. So let's try that in the Python interpreter.

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,230
We're going to time an execution where

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,560
what we're evaluating is calling spin loop, passing

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,584
in some numbers. So we'll try 1,000 first.

12
00:00:36,584 --> 00:00:39,390
And what time execution does is return two

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,620
values. The result and the run time. We only want the second one, so we'll index

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,654
to get the second value out of the return result, and see that result. So that's

15
00:00:50,654 --> 00:00:57,088
what we get, so it took 0.0001 seconds to do spin loop a thousand. If I increase

16
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:04,369
this to 10,000, I see that it takes 0.0006. Lets try 100,000,

17
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:09,894
adding one more zero and I see now it takes 0.005. I'm going to write this a

18
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:15,770
little differently, so we can see it more easily. So now, instead of writing

19
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:22,070
out a 100,000, I'll do ten star, star, five, which is the same value as writing

20
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:28,810
out a one followed by five zeros. And for good measure, we'll do ten star, star,

21
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,350
six, which is a million times through the loop, and we see that, that takes 0.05

22
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:38,180
seconds. So here's the examples of timing loops.

23
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,420
For your quiz, your goal is to estimate

24
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,940
the expected execution time for a value running spin loop where the input of the

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,550
loop is ten star star nine, that's one

26
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,480
billion. And you should give your answer in

27
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,110
the number of seconds. Of course it's not

28
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,980
possible to get the exact answer, but you

29
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,920
should be able to get a guess within about 20% of our answer to be correct.
