1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,790
It written out in nice predicate logic we have what's shown here. It says for

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:12,570
all i, okay, so i, sorry for all is the quantifier, i is the index variable.

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,280
And we're going to qualify i by saying it's, it's greater than or

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,420
equal to 1. And it's less than the length of Y when we put a vector

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,320
inside of the vertical lines that's the, the length or cardinality of it.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,240
It must be case so the, the dot that we have here separating the two parts,

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:39,020
you can read it must be the case. We can, use that i to pick out an element

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:44,360
of Y and compare it to the element that Y plus 1 if in fact we have ordered

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,750
output it had better be less than or equal to it. Notice that we said less than

10
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,560
the length of Y and that gets us around the problem of trying to index into

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,460
a value of the vector into a position of the vector that doesn't exist.
