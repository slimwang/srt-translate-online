00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now I'd like to ask you to do a slightly more challenging programming assignment.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Imagine we have a die that has an arbitrary number of sides

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and each side can be labeled anything we want.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And the die can be fair or it can be loaded.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I called that here dist.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You can think of it as a distribution of values

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
or, more formally, a probability distribution,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but that doesn't really matter for this exercise

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
because in the lecture we learned about likelihood in the context of coins.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Here I'd like to ask you about in the context of a die that can have any number of sides,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
labeled anything, with any probability.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And I'd like you to write a function called likelihood

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
that takes the data and the distribution and returns the likelihood.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I wrote one. Let's see what it produces.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You can see we get a very, very small number.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That's actually quite common with likelihoods

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
because there are so many different data values,

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
any given one likely has a pretty small value.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That said, they can still be interesting.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Now let's look at the code you're going to have to write.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Here is the function.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Likelihood that takes a distribution and data, just as we saw below.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Insert your code here. Have fun.
