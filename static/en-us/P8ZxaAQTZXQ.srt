1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,180
I'll start off by creating
an empty dictionary.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,000
Then, I'll loop through
the enrollments and

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,790
notice here that I'm using the new
enrollments variable I created,

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,690
which doesn't include
the audacity test accounts.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,330
I want to add the student to the
dictionary if they haven't cancelled yet

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,000
or if it was at least seven
days before they did cancel.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,224
Then I'll pull out the account,

8
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:22,080
cancel the enrollment date and
save those in variables.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,180
And I'll add those to the dictionary
with the account_key as the key and

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,170
the enrollment_date as the value.

11
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,710
Then I'll use the line function to
see how many students this is and

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,580
it comes out to 995.

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,050
Now this works, but there's
something a little strange about it.

14
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,640
Earlier we saw that the same student
can enroll multiple times and

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,410
if that happens,

16
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,350
then I'm just going to be saving an
arbitrary one of those enrollment dates.

17
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,830
Instead, I think it makes sense to save
their most recent enrollment date in

18
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,030
that case.

19
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,670
To accomplish that, I'll add another
check and I'll only add the enrollment

20
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,850
date to the dictionary if either the
account key was not already present, or

21
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,790
if this enrollment date is more recent
than the date that's already present.

22
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,960
And I'll rerun the cell.

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,760
Of course, that shouldn't change
the number of paid students,

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,780
it just changed what enrollment date
was saved for certain students.
