00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,620
>> So, Michael, I know we said that was the

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,400
last quiz but I think we should do one more

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,110
quiz. So the quiz is going to be on convex polygons.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,580
And X is going to be an R squared. And

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,780
the hypothesis is going to be points inside some convex holygo-,

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,420
polygon. And, and inside means the same thing as we

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,430
meant with circles. So, if you're on the polygon or

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,440
on the perimeter of the polygon, then you're inside the polygon

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,050
for the purpose of this discussion. So, here's my question

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,040
to you Michael. What is the VC dimension of convex polygons?

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,820
>> Well, if I had to.

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,020
>> Ask someone else, you would say it was a quiz and you'd let them do it.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,690
>> Is this a quiz? Oh, it's a quiz for me.

14
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,426
>> Well, I dunno, do you want to let the students get a, get a try?

15
00:00:41,426 --> 00:00:43,190
>> Well, yeah, and then we can answer it by simply

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,411
going to the quiz if we actually go to the quiz [LAUGH].

17
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:47,490
>> [LAUGH] Okay, so let's go to a quiz. Go.
