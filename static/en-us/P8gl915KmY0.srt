00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,744
Here the answer should be the quantity x minus 3 squared. Great pattern

2
00:00:04,744 --> 00:00:09,182
recognition if you figured that one out. We can see that the first and last

3
00:00:09,182 --> 00:00:14,730
terms are perfect squares, x squared is x squared and 3 squared is 9. This term

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,010
is negative which fits my negative sign in the factoring pattern, so I'll have x

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,580
squared minus 2x times 3 plus 3 squared. The a is really x and the b is really

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,878
3. I know I can factor this using a minus b squared, so I just write

7
00:00:29,878 --> 00:00:34,675
parentheses, x minus 3 squared. The one thing we want to notice is that, if this

8
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:39,060
term is positive, then we use a positive in the squared binomial. If this term

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,383
is negative, then we use a negative sign in our factored form.
