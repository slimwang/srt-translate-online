00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,180
Subclassing was really easy when we were using the functional pattern here.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,370
But let's explore how we might do this if we were using the pseudo-classical

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,420
pattern for our base class.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,780
How do we go about writing pseudo-classical subclasses?

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,830
For practice, let's start this program from scratch.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,558
It'll be good to build up the program one line at a time, anyway.

7
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:21,790
Since the pseudo-classical code we're about to write is going to look so

8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,170
different from the functional code we already wrote.

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,300
Furthermore, let's use some different sample code in our run.js file.

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,110
It'll be easier to think about this if we're only instantiating one instance of

11
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,980
the superclass and one instance of one of the subclasses.

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,100
So just like before, Van is a subclass of Car.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,640
Amy is an instance of van, and this new zed object will be an instance of a car.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,980
We won't examine the cop class here, or any instantiation of it,

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,190
because we only need to see one example of a subclass to make the point.

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,900
By reading this first line of code,

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,520
I can tell that I'm going to need a car function to make instances of cars and

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,350
it'll take an input to use as a location for the new car.

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,190
Inside the Car function we will do the work that is specific to

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,160
one instance of a car.

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,830
In this case, adding a property that should be different across all cars.

22
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,510
But what about that move property that Car instances like zed appear to need?

23
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,290
Take a moment to decide where you think you would add that functionality for

24
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,910
this pseudo-classical Car class.

25
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,200
Edit the car class so

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,050
that it exhibits the move function that we remember from before.
