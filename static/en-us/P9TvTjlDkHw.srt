1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,050
Let's go ahead and double click on
the clock handle seconds controller file

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,450
which will open up the animator window.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,360
This window houses all
the information pertaining to

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,680
animating our clock second hand.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,750
As you can see the two animations we
already created already exist here and

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,550
are represented by boxes.

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,770
In addition to these boxes we also
have a box called entry in any state.

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,180
If we drag over by pressing Alt and

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,270
left clicking,
we'll find another box called exit.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,350
All these boxes are called
states which are all part

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,930
of a gigantic state machine.

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,230
A state machine is a system that
connects multiple states together

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,890
via transitions.

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,060
At any given point our clock hand
can only be in one state and

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,180
that state represents what animation
our clock hand is currently doing.

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,200
The states entry and
exit are special states for

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,420
when our state machine starts up and
ends.

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,160
The any state is a special state that
represents all animation states.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,730
It will make a bit more
sense when we talk about

20
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,129
how to transition between states.

21
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,110
In order to move to a different state,
we need to define a transition.

22
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,930
To do that, right-click on a state that
we want to make a transition from and

23
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,000
click Make transition.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,040
Once we do that,
an arrow will began to follow our mouse

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,320
until we click on a state
we want to transition too.

26
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,670
Let's strike to the reverse
seconds rotations state.

27
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,100
To make this a bit more readable,

28
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,740
let's move our states around just
by clicking and dragging them.

29
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,680
Let's also create another
transition between reverse seconds

30
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,790
rotation and exit.

31
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,790
If we now switch over to scene view and

32
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,970
hit play, we'll see that our clock
hand is now swinging back and forth.

33
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,290
Now surprisingly, the hand doesn't
do a full rotation back and forth.

34
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,020
And this is because unity is actually
interpolating the transition

35
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,285
instead of completing
the full transition.

36
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:56,065
If you want to resolve this issue
check out the extra reading for

37
00:01:56,065 --> 00:01:58,345
more information on how to solve it.

38
00:01:58,345 --> 00:02:01,715
But since we're going to be able to
dynamically control when we transition

39
00:02:01,715 --> 00:02:04,085
in upcoming videos this
problem will disappear.
