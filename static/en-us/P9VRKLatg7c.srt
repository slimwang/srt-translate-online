1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,140
All right, and
the correct answer is all of the above.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,840
It really doesn't matter what you
use as your place holder images, so

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,200
long as you actually have images there.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,320
What matters more is that they're
being laid out correctly, and

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,750
that they're ready to go once
you do have the real images.
