1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It turns out that the answer that we're looking for is 3.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Ob is one and tuse is another, and it's really tempting

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
to put obtuse together because they're separated by a comment.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You think "Boy, if I just remove that comment, they'd be one word, obtuse."

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But remember, you really want to treat comments as if you were totally erasing them

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
so it leaves a gap.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The lexer is entering the HTML comment. Mode, it's coming back.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Ob and tuse are really quite separate, and then we've got tangle as the third at the end.
