00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,140
In this lesson we learned about
memory consistency which defines

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:10,530
what is allowed to happen when processor
cores are reordering memory accesses.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,550
We have seen that sequential consistency
gives us the behavior we expect but

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,630
that it can limit performance.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,160
And we have seen that more relaxed
memory consistency models can improve

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,920
performance but make program behavior
more difficult to reason about.
