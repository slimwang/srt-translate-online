1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,820
Something else they did,
was they tracked the state of the hand.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,370
So, what do you mean,
the state of the hand?

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,840
That's actually, you, I,
I encourage you to read the paper.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,160
They did a couple of really cool things.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,220
First of all, you have Translation.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,660
Okay?
Well, how many degrees of freedom in

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,710
translation?

8
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,110
Well, we're doing it in two dimensions,
so there's two degrees of freedom.

9
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,200
They had a Rotation.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,610
Okay.
Which is one degree of freedom.

11
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,490
But the other thing they added to
that was the shape of the hand.

12
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,920
And you might ask, well how did
they encode the shape of the hand.

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,010
Don't bother Megan.

14
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,620
Well actually what they did was they
took a whole bunch of images of

15
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,460
contours.

16
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,190
And then they did a form of
principle components analysis.

17
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,510
Now you may not know what that is.

18
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,720
But the good news is you will.

19
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,600
Very soon we're going to do principle
corner analysis when we talk about,

20
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,540
recognition.

21
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,560
The thing that matters is that it has
a low dimensional representation of,

22
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,470
certain variation.

23
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,700
And what they did is they
extracted out essentially,

24
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,460
instead of keeping rotation separately,
they took ten degrees of freedom

25
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,870
that represented the shape of
the hand including rotation.

26
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,040
So you had two for translation and
ten for rot, for the,

27
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,670
for the rotation and shape.

28
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,985
So, that's a 12 degree
of freedom of space.

29
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:11,467
So that's even more difficult to do the,
tracking with particles because you have

30
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:13,660
to have a lot of particles
in order to do this.
