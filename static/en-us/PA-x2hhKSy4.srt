00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,775
The answer is in
the CreateAccountActivity class.

2
00:00:02,775 --> 00:00:05,604
Specifically, I'm going to scroll down,
so

3
00:00:05,604 --> 00:00:10,101
here in the onCreatAccountPressed
method, you call createUser, which

4
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:14,755
creates the user in what I'm calling
the Firebase credentials data store.

5
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:17,710
And then, if it's successful,
it'll call onSuccess.

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,670
And then, this location is where you
should create your own user POJO,

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,230
which would contain all that
extra app specific data,

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,770
and then you can put that POJO
in the Firebase database.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,880
Okay, so to reiterate,
you should be doing two things.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,090
First, making a user POJO, and
second, adding the code here

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,700
to then effectively create the user
in your Firebase database.

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,690
I'll send over the spec right now.
