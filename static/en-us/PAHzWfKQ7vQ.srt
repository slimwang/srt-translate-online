1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,950
Now the loftiest desire would be to predict the precise time of day.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,270
And so, we would consider using time of day as the quantity.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,860
Now I said the loftiest desire,

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,080
because this would actually be the most difficult form of prediction.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,770
This means we could produce any time of day in the future at all and ask,

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,120
when is the next time the person is going to tweet, relative to that time?

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,950
For example, at eight in the morning, I could ask, at 3 p.m.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,660
later today, when is he going to tweet soonest after that time?

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,280
Now alternatively, we could think of the phenomenon of

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,830
tweeting as a process that starts over after each tweet.

11
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,800
In that case, a more appropriate quantity to think about might be the amount of

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,140
time since the last tweet.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,840
Let's make the hypothesis that this is the right way to

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,250
think about the phenomenon.

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,030
How long until you tweet next, and how it is influenced by any other factors.

16
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,490
Let's call this quantity the inter-tweet time.
