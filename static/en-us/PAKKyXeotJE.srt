1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:03,309
So here we start our little mathematical foray down into making it

2
00:00:03,309 --> 00:00:04,689
from geometry to algebra.

3
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:06,570
So I just wrote what we had before.

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,563
The X prime, the position or location of X in the prime frame can

5
00:00:11,563 --> 00:00:16,842
just be expressed just having rotated the X frame by the R amount and

6
00:00:16,842 --> 00:00:18,930
then translating it by T.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,750
All right?

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,370
Great.

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,949
Let's just cross both sides of that equation by T.

10
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:30,134
So we have T cross X prime on the left, but on the right, we have T cross and

11
00:00:30,134 --> 00:00:36,090
it's just, because of distributive property it's T cross RX plus T cross T.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:36,750
All right?

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,090
And by the way, I, I wrote here that this is normal to the plane.

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,488
Remember that T cross X prime is going to be something that's perpendicular to

15
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:45,421
both of them, so

16
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:50,170
that would be perpendicular to the epipolar plane that, that we're showing here.

17
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,267
We'll, we'll maybe make use of that in a minute, but

18
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:53,509
I just want you to realize that.

19
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:57,309
More importantly, what you should see is that we've got T cross T here.

20
00:00:57,309 --> 00:00:58,850
What's T cross T?

21
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,930
Not very much.

22
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,610
Otherwise, known as zero.

23
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,530
Okay?

24
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:08,830
So that just means that T cross X prime is equal to T cross RX, got it?

25
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,570
Okay.

26
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,289
Now let's take both sides of that equation and I'm going to dot it with X prime.

27
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:21,829
So we got X prime dot T cross X prime equals X prime dot T cross RX.

28
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:25,570
I sure hope you're reading this, because listening to me sounds ridiculous.

29
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,450
Okay?

30
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,510
Well, let's take a look at this left-hand side.

31
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,090
Okay?

32
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,002
T cross X prime gives us what?

33
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:39,031
Well, it gives us a vector that's perpendicular to the plane containing T and

34
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:39,649
X prime.

35
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:42,809
So it's perpendicular to T and it's perpendicular to X prime.

36
00:01:42,809 --> 00:01:46,090
And then I dotted it with X prime, so what am I going to get?

37
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,490
Zero, right?

38
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,850
because it's perpendicular and if everything goes well, there it is in yellow.

39
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,190
Zero is equal to X prime dot T times RX.

40
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,050
Okay?

41
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,590
So far so good?

42
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,090
Good.
