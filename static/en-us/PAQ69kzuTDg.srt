00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,360
We simply select the article-items and

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,310
then use the .css method to change font-size to 20 pixels.

00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,990
After hitting Test Run, let's see how it looks.

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,410

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,309
All of the articles have much larger text.

00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:16,810
Very cool.
