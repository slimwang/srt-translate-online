1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,415
Here are two important differences.

2
00:00:02,415 --> 00:00:04,411
One difference is scale.

3
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:07,399
When you're doing software design, iit's probably because you

4
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:10,449
are dealing with a big problem that's going to have a big solution.

5
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:14,523
If you're doing programming, you're more likely concerned with programs that

6
00:00:14,523 --> 00:00:18,669
are going to end up being 100 or 1,000, or maybe even 10,000 lines.

7
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:22,848
The International Space Station has 30 million lines of code.

8
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:25,620
Another key difference between programming and

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,370
design, software design, is the role that non-functional requirements play.

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,956
For programs, you may at a, occasionally be concerned with performance but

11
00:00:33,956 --> 00:00:37,980
by and large, non-functional requirements don't play a big role.

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,990
With software design, the whole story is how you

13
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,342
are going to deal with trade-offs among non-functional requirements.
