1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,320
So Paul, what actually happens
when you connect your bill process

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:03,846
to the browser?

3
00:00:03,846 --> 00:00:07,598
[SOUND]
>> Magic.

4
00:00:07,598 --> 00:00:10,455
>> I'm going to need you
to be a bit more specific.

5
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:12,008
>> All right, all right then,

6
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:16,040
let me tell you about the magical
world of live editing.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,380
Say your job is to construct shelves,

8
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,399
just imagine how much your life
would suck without a power drill.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,560
Sure, a manual screwdriver does the job,
and

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,700
works, if you're just constructing
a shelf for yourself once a year.

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,770
But a power drill will save you lots
of time and energy in the long run, and

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,750
leave you great optimization.

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,158
Unless your plan is to get
Popeye's arms, of course.

14
00:00:35,158 --> 00:00:38,870
In the world of web development,
you'll see a very similar pattern.

15
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,152
You make a change to your code,
save, rebuild if you need to,

16
00:00:42,152 --> 00:00:43,840
switch to the browser and
reload the page.

17
00:00:44,855 --> 00:00:47,480
These micro context switches
might seem harmless, but

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,370
you're doing this thousands
of times each day.

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,730
If you now ask yourself, well,
surely there's a better way then?

20
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,290
You'd be right.

21
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,850
Live Editing solves
exactly that problem.

22
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,300
It works by having
a watcher in your editor or

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,830
build process that's connected to
a similar watcher in the browser.

24
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,040
When you save a file,
these two communicate, and

25
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,710
the website is reloaded or patched on
the fly without you having to intervene.

26
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,820
That means fewer contact switches as you
can now have your editor right next to

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,390
your browser window and
see changes happen as you code.

28
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,250
In the next hands on step, James is
going to be teaching you how to set up

29
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,830
Live Editing in three different ways.

30
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,720
Live on every keystroke in Sublime,
on every save via Gulp, and

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,990
skipping the editor all together to move
your entire workflow into the browser.

32
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,010
In the end,
we prefer to build two versions, and

33
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:33,970
James is going to tell you why.
