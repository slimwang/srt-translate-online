00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,060
Way back in lesson one, we reviewed
some of the problems of U.S. healthcare.

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,990
Too many errors is another problem.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,510
In it's landmark 1999 publication,
To Error is Human,

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,800
Building a Safer Health System, the
institute of medicine famously said that

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,830
from 44,000 to 98,000 Americans,
are killed each year in U.S.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,710
hospitals due to entirely
preventable reasons.

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,240
Many of those listed,
such as adverse drug events,

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,830
improper transfusions,
wrong side surgery, and

9
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:38,780
mistaken patient identities,
have to do with mishandling of data.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,750
This leads to one of
the key arguments for

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,570
adoption of electronic medical records.

12
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,950
However, electronic records themselves,
can be a new source of error.

13
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,960
We now turn to that.

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,950
First we need to acknowledge
the magnitude of the challenge.
