1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:02,310
So we discussed role-based
access control and

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,820
we also talked about discretionary and
mandatory access control.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,070
So, this quiz question is asking you,
if role-based access control,

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,430
which is used often in commercial
settings, is an example of mandatory

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,670
access control and if it is,
then how do you actually justify

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,540
this statement that RBAC is in fact
a mandatory access control policy?
