1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,350
So here's what we have for compounding twice a year with Grant's situation.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,424
This of course is just an example and these numbers could be different

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:11,990
depending on how his account was set up. However, numbers have played their

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,032
roles as I've written in here. This number is his principle, the amount he

5
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:21,504
first invested. Here goes the interest rate divided by 2, And the exponent is

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,300
the number of years that have passed multiplied by 2. Now we always like

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,350
generalizations so let's see if we can apply one here. I think we're going to

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,200
need some variable names however. Let's call our principal P. r will be our

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,766
annual interest rate written as a decimal. T will be the number of years that

10
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:48,543
have passed since the account opened. N will be the number of times interest is

11
00:00:48,543 --> 00:00:54,636
compounded per year. This was two in our example up here. And A will be the

12
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:58,997
total amount of money in the account. I'd like you to use these quantities we

13
00:00:58,997 --> 00:01:04,438
just came up with to create a general equation for A. The total amount of money

14
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:10,050
in the account. Just fill in the proper letters in these different slots.

15
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,266
Remember you can use this formula as a guideline for figuring out what goes

16
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:16,030
where here.
