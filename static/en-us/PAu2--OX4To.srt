Let's use our idea of perimeter to solve this problem. The length of a rectangle

2
00:00:04,306 --> 00:00:08,377
is 6 feet more than its width, and the perimeter of that rectangle is 52 feet.

3
00:00:08,473 --> 00:00:12,519
What are the dimensions, length and width, of the rectangle? To start this

4
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:16,745
problem, let's draw a diagram. Here's a rectangle, with a width and a length.

5
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:21,179
Notice the opposite sides of the rectangle are the same. This is true for all

6
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:25,842
rectangles. Before we answer this question, let's break our problem down into a

7
00:00:25,854 --> 00:00:30,363
smaller step. Let's start with an equation. So I want you to write an equation

8
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:34,820
for the perimeter of the rectangle. Use p for the perimeter, l for the length,

9
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:39,494
and w for the width. Write your equation in this box. Remember, equations have

10
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,436
an equal sign, expressions don't.
