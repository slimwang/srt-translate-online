00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let me ask a more general question now.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What may happen if h, the heuristic, is not admissible?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
A-star finds the optimal path always.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
A-star may find a suboptimal path in some cases.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A-star may fail to find a path even if one exists.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Or none of the above.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In answering this question, it is important to say this is a statement that always applies,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and these statements suggest they just apply sometimes

9
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
under certain circumstances.
