1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,144
To get rid of our log here, we need to take both sides as the exponent of 10.

2
00:00:05,144 --> 00:00:11,320
The left hand side becomes 10 to the 1.1, and on the right hand side that will

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,920
just leave us with J over C. Now let's use our calculator. 10 to the 1.1 is

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:28,310
equal to 12.589 and so on, or rounded, about 12.6. So what does this mean?

5
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,170
Well, that means that the intensity of the Japenese earthquake was about 12.6

6
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:39,165
times greater than the worst California recorded earthquake.
