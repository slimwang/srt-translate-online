1
00:00:00,183 --> 00:00:01,933
Now for a little more terminology.

2
00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:07,004
We'd say that a valid sentence is one
that is true in every possible model for

3
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:11,550
every combination of values
of the propositional symbols.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,450
And a unsatisfiable sentence is
one that is true in some model but

5
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:19,530
not necessarily in all the models.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:25,020
So what I want you to do,
is tell me for each of these sentences,

7
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:32,350
whether it is valid, satisfiable but
not valid, or unsatisfiable.

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,179
In other words, false for all models.

9
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:40,387
And sentences are P or not P, P and

10
00:00:40,387 --> 00:00:46,429
not P, P or Q or P is equivalent to Q.

11
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:50,604
P implies Q or Q implies P.

12
00:00:50,604 --> 00:00:56,265
And finally, food implies party or
drinks implies party.

13
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:59,200
Implies food and drinks implies party.
