1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And here the correct answer is 0.009,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which is the product of your prior, 0.01, times the conditional, 0.9.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Over here we get 0.001, the probability of our prior cancer times 0.1.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Over here we get 0.198,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
the probability of not having cancer is 0.99

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
times still getting a positive reading, which is 0.2.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And finally, we get 0.792,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which is the probability of this guy over here, and this guy over here.
