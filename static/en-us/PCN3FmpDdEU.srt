1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,290
There are four major learning goals for this class. First, you'll learn about

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,930
the core methods of knowledge-based AI. These methods include schemes for

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,190
structured knowledge representation, methods for memory organization,

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,880
methods for reasoning, methods for learning, [UNKNOWN] architectures as well as

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,910
methods for meta reasoning. Meta reasoning is reasoning about reasoning. Second,

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,300
you learn about some of the common tasks addressed by knowledge-based AI,

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:32,350
such as classification, understanding, planning, explanation, diagnosis,

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,470
and design. Third, you will learn ways AI agents can use these

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,470
methods to address these tasks. Fourth, you learn the relationship between

10
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,080
the knowledge-based AI cognitive science. Using theories of

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,980
human cognition to inspire their design of human level, human-like AI and

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,140
using AI techniques to generate testable hypothesis about human cognition.
