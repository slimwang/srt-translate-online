These numbers are actually really important. They can represent a fraction. They

2
00:00:04,778 --> 00:00:09,362
can represent a parts of a whole. So, for example, for the circle I have 3 parts

3
00:00:09,374 --> 00:00:13,460
out of 8 or 3 8ths. The three represents my numerator, it's how many parts I

4
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:17,828
have. The eight represents my denominator, it's how many pieces or parts are in

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,068
the whole figure. Fractions don't always have to refer to shapes, they can refer

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,999
to other things, and we'll look at this later in the course. But for now, we're

7
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:29,934
just going to focus on these images and shapes. So 3 8ths is a fraction for this

8
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:33,707
circle, I want to you find the fraction for these others. You can enter your

9
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,800
answer in these boxes. 3 8ths can also be written as 3 slash 8. It's another way

10
00:00:37,812 --> 00:00:41,573
of writing a fraction. That's how you should type it in when you type it into

11
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:42,163
these boxes.
