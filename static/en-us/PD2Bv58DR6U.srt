00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So given that we've just seen how to code up HTML comments,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
let's test out that knowledge.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Suppose we have our definition of HTML comments

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
plus a rule for word tokens that are

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
anything that's not a space, a left angle, a right angle, one or more of the above.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We return that token, and now I give you the following HTML input fragment,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
"ob fuscation tuse tangle."

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
For this blue string, for our lexer, we've got word tokens.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We've got HTML comments.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
How many word tokens are we going to find?
