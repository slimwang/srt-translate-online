00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,335
Transparency is the main point of failure. The other methods changed the

2
00:00:03,335 --> 00:00:06,761
illumination on a single surface. The final value is then mapped in some

3
00:00:06,761 --> 00:00:10,780
fashion to a color. With transparency, you're first mapping the opaque material

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,080
to a color then you're blending this color with whatever transparent filter is

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,800
covering a pixel, then mapping that result to some new color. It's mixing

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,460
results from shaded pixels with solid colors which is unlikely to work well.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,640
We'll see in a later lesson that image processing is often a better way to

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,085
perform cel shading, as this maps from some final shaded color to a solid value

9
00:00:30,085 --> 00:00:32,289
just once.
