1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And for mode the answer is clear.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The answer is 3 because 3 has 3 data points

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and no other value has more than 2.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The median is also 3.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We have 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11 data points.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Median value will be the 6th data point.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It has 5 above and 5 below, and that happens to be a 3.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The mean is a little trickier to calculate.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We could probably eyeball it as being a little above 3

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
since if there weren't these points over here it would be 3,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but let's just work it out quickly.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:59,000
1 + 4 + 9 + 8 + 5 + 6 + 11.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And those equal 44.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And we had figured before there were 11 data points,

15
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so it's 44/11, and that is equal to 4.
