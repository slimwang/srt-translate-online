00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,064
A couple lessons back we've talked about
how their various types of request that

2
00:00:04,064 --> 00:00:05,248
you can make to the server.

3
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:08,286
And so far, we've talk
specifically about get request and

4
00:00:08,286 --> 00:00:10,668
then have seen how to use
them in our examples.

5
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:14,283
Earlier in this lesson, we mentioned
that we'd also be implementing what's

6
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:17,528
called the post request to add a feature
to our my favorite movies app.

7
00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:19,450
Now, it's time to look
at this in more detail.

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,670
A POST request, as you may recall
is a request where the client

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,170
submits data to a web server for
processing.

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,010
The data that's sent is enclosed in
the message body of the request,

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,340
which can then be processed
to a specified resource.

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,980
We'll use a post request to favorite or

13
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,540
unfavorite a movie in
the Favorite Movies list of our app.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,870
So let's go back to the movie
database's API documentation.

15
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,490
By searching for the word favorite on
the API page, I found this method,

16
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,740
which allows me to add or

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,150
remove a movie to an account's favorite
list, which seems like what we want.

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,375
Now we'll click on the post banner
to open up the right-hand panel,

19
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,828
which has information on
how to set up this request.

20
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:03,678
Here at the top, we see the URL that
the POST request should be made to.

21
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:07,390
In other words, that's where the
resource we want to update is located.

22
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,230
Now, this section underneath that
is titled request should give us

23
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,100
the information that we need
to create this in code.

24
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,070
These little drop down menus give
us a few additional options.

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,908
Let's keep this setting as production
and this one appears to be

26
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:24,828
a language setting, so let's set
it to Swift and see what we get.

27
00:01:24,828 --> 00:01:29,098
Cool, this looks like stuff we can use
even if we don't know exactly what

28
00:01:29,098 --> 00:01:29,728
it is yet.

29
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:32,678
But before we dig into it,
I feel like we missed something.

30
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:36,358
What was this over here at the top
before we changed to Swift?

31
00:01:36,358 --> 00:01:39,618
Headers, we haven't
talked about that yet.

32
00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:43,389
So headers are actually a part of
an HTTP request along with the URL and

33
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:47,226
the message body, they allow us to
supply additional parameters that

34
00:01:47,226 --> 00:01:49,518
specify how the request should operate.

35
00:01:49,518 --> 00:01:52,618
Here we see that for this request,
two headers are supplied.

36
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:57,531
The accept header field allows us to
specify which content types will accept

37
00:01:57,531 --> 00:01:58,458
in response.

38
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:02,360
In our case,
we want to accept JSON as our response.

39
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,021
The content type header field let's
us specify what kind of content we're

40
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:07,078
sending in the body.

41
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:09,173
In other words,
what format our data is in,

42
00:02:09,173 --> 00:02:12,698
so that the server knows what's coming
and can determine how to parse it.

43
00:02:12,698 --> 00:02:15,578
There are many other types
of HTTP header fields.

44
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:18,548
A list of them is linked
in the instructor notes.

45
00:02:18,548 --> 00:02:19,228
Awesome.

46
00:02:19,228 --> 00:02:21,288
Now, we understand what
these headers are for.

47
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:24,110
Let's go back to this code and see if
we can understand what's happening.

48
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,080
So this already looks a bit familiar, we
did this when making our other requests.

49
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,144
Here, we are creating the URL and

50
00:02:32,144 --> 00:02:36,368
then using NSMuteableURLRequest
to make the request from the URL.

51
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:38,640
Now these lines are new,
but if you look at them,

52
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,424
we already know what they're doing.

53
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:43,133
Request.HTTPMethod = POST,

54
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:48,047
we're setting our request
method type to be of type post,

55
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:54,488
then request.addvalue application/json
for HTTP header field accept.

56
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:59,308
This is just the code we need
to set up our two header fields.

57
00:02:59,308 --> 00:03:02,912
Now if we look back at what was
displayed when we had the language

58
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:06,458
settings set to raw, there was
what looked to be a bit of JSON.

59
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:13,026
"Media_type", "movie", "media_id",
550, "favorite", true.

60
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,386
This seems like the information
we'd want to give the server, but

61
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:18,008
with our own values specified.

62
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:21,284
So it looks like this little JSON piece
is here to show us what we should

63
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:21,908
be sending.

64
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:25,120
Let's look back at the Swift
code we're provided.

65
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,158
Request.HTTPBody =.

66
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:32,699
So it looks like here's where
we want to supply that data,

67
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:34,518
the data that we want to post.

68
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:37,458
This is where we should fill in
what movie we're talking about and

69
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,390
whether we want favorite to be true or
not.

70
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,680
Those can be variables that
we can put in our code.

71
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,220
The rest of this is actually
all stuff we've seen before.

72
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,480
Just getting the sessions,
making the task, etc.

73
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,490
We already know how to do that.

74
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,970
So when you make this POST
request in your app in Xcode,

75
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,630
you should be able to copy over
most of the spoiler plate code and

76
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,210
only really need to change a few things.
