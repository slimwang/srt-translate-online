1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] The correct answer is 16.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The probability of A and C require 1 parameter each.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The complement of not A and not C follows by 1 minus that parameter.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This guy over here requires 2 parameters.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You need to know the probability of B given A and B given not A.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The complements can be obtained easily.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The probability of D is conditioned on 2 variables which can take 4 possible values.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hence the number is 4.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And E is conditioned on 3 variables, so it can take a total of 8 different values,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
2 to the 3rd, which is 8.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If you add 8 plus 4 plus 2 plus 1 plus 1, you get 16.
