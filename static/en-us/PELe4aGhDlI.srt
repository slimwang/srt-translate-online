00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,007
>> And the answer is line D. Note that the scale on the x-axis is that two days

2
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:10,460
pass for every square we move over. Now on the y-axis, every grid line indicates

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,968
another $1000 in profit. We can see that on our orange line, if we move over two

4
00:00:15,968 --> 00:00:21,285
days, we have to move up a $1000, and 1000 over 2 is 500. We also can see that

5
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:26,541
the y intercept is at 0, negative 2000, which is what we're looking for.
