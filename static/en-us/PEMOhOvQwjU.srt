Okay, so this is what I wrote. The document

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,470
object model stores data about the content of a page

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,080
and the properties of each note word. To build the

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,940
DOM, the browser parses HTML and creates tokens from HTML

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,540
tags. Some tokens indicate a tag start, others indicate a

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,490
tag end. The tokens are converted into node objects, forming

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,810
a tree structure, which we call the DOM. The relationships

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,260
between objects in the DOM tells us which ones are

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,130
parents and which ones are children. It's also worth noting that

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,960
DOM construction is incremental, which means that we can start building the

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,720
DOM as soon as we have the HTML and we don`t

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,160
need to wait for the entire HTML page to start building it.
