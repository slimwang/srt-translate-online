1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,150
So far,
we've only set the vegan daily special.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,790
So, if you press the Daily Special
button, press Vegan, choose Vegan,

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,440
and you'll get the Vegan Daily Special
that you set in Tag Manager.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,309
But, if you choose any of
the other options like,

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,930
Prefer Fish, you're actually going to
get the daily special, N, EN,

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,090
the english daily special
that we set earlier.

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,750
And we're going to be
adding more variables and

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,860
triggers for
the different food preferences next.
