1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,410
You're still here.
All right, don't tell Catherine, but

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,370
I made a bonus lesson for you guys.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,080
So this lesson is optional, but for

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,290
those of you who are eager
to learn more, stick around.

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,230
So we'll show you how to add some
new features to your tool belt.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,740
So in this lesson, you'll learn about an
Android component called a view pager,

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,940
which will allow users
to easily swipe left and

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,270
right between the vocabulary words list.

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,980
And this means one less click
between the user and their content.

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,540
Now similar to the ListView, the view
pager's populated using an adapter.

11
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,540
So you'll get another opportunity to
see how adopters are using Android.

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,290
Now let's started.

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,610
>> Jessica,
what are you still doing here?

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:43,280
Hello, Jessica, I see you here,
what are you saying to the student?

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,080
Okay, I have better things to do,
I'm going to go home.
