00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,330
One super cool thing to me about
spectral partitioning is that you can

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,440
derive it using the graph laplacian
as it appears in a particular

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,020
physical system.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,220
Imagine that you have a bunch
of sticks of infinite length.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,680
Let's suppose the sticks
are fixed meaning they don't move.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,790
This dashed line is just a reference.

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,050
We're going to measure distances
relative to the reference.

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,090
And suppose each stick has
a weight attached to it.

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,720
And let's suppose each weight
has a mass of little m.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,600
We're talking about a physical system so
the mass would be measured in, say,

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,840
kilograms.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,490
And for simplicity, let's assume
all the weights have the same mass.

13
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,250
Now imagine that you connect
these weights by springs so

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,120
then if you take all the weights and
you displace them by some amount

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,620
relative to one another,
the strings will stretch.

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,790
And the weights will move up and down.

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,250
So what I want us to do is study
the motion of these weights.

18
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,480
Let's zoom in on one of the weights.

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,970
Now, relative to the reference line,

20
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:59,330
weight i will be displaced by
some amount at any point in time.

21
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,170
Let's call this
displacement x of i of t.

22
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,250
Now, in Physics 101, you would have
analyzed the motion of these weights,

23
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,030
using Newton's laws and
Hooke's laws for springs.

24
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,120
Yaaar, did someone say springs?!

25
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,820
Here's a quick reminder.

26
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,560
Newton's Law says that the net
force acting on a object

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,090
causes it to accelerate in
linear proportion to its mass.

28
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,780
Hooke's Law says that the force
from a spring is proportional to

29
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,600
how much it stretched.

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,960
Hooke's Law holds if this
degree of stretching or

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,370
displacement is relatively small.

32
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,100
Now, if that all sounds like a bunch of
nonsensical mumbo jumbo, don't worry,

33
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,030
I'm not testing you on physics.

34
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,450
Just hang in there with me, and
I promise something neat will happen.

35
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,700
So let's go back to this ith weight.

36
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,590
Its motion is determined by
the net force acting on it.

37
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,600
By Hooke's Law,

38
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,700
that force will depend on how much
the strings are being stretched.

39
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,570
And in fact, each string will
be stretched by the difference

40
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,458
between the displacements of the masses.

41
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:59,540
So, the right-hand side is
just the sum of these forces.

42
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,310
Now, rewriting the right-hand
side you'll get the following.

43
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,620
Notice the values of the coefficients.

44
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,199
So, the net force acting on
a given mass is proportional to

45
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,500
the displacements of its neighbors.

46
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,100
In fact,
I can rewrite this entire system for

47
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,100
all the masses as a system
of differential equations.

48
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,090
Let's define a vector x arrow,

49
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,240
whose components are all
the springs displacements.

50
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,840
Then the entire system of differential
equations can be written in

51
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,400
the following form.

52
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,500
I've used matrix notation here to
express the entire system very

53
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,920
compactly.

54
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,860
So, does this matrix look familiar?

55
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,570
Why it's nothing more
than a graph laplacian.

56
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,030
In particular, it's the graph
laplacian for a line graph.

57
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,240
I know what you're thinking,

58
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,280
okay Vudoc, what on God's green earth
does this have to do with partitioning?

59
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,680
Therein lies the neat surprise.

60
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,970
Start by asking yourself what would
the motion of this system of weights and

61
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,610
springs look like?

62
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,420
The top plot is the displacement
of all the weights.

63
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,820
Every weight is a dot and the springs
are the solid lines connecting the dots.

64
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,770
The bottom plot will show you
the velocity of all of the weights.

65
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,890
At the beginning suppose we give
a little kick to the middle weight so

66
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,220
that its velocity is one unit
of distance per unit of time and

67
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,960
the other weights are at
rest with velocity zero.

68
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,010
That's how you read the initial
picture shown in the bottom plot.

69
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,940
So from this starting point,
let's see what happens.

70
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,450
Notice how the springs are bobbing up
and down with a kind of wavy motion.

71
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,940
In fact,
this motion can always be described

72
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,550
as a sum of fundamental displacements.

73
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,080
Which are basically sines and

74
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,300
cosine curves at various
fundamental frequencies or modes.

75
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,250
If you have a background in music,
you know about harmonics,

76
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,720
and harmonics are modes for
say, vibrating strings.

77
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,490
Now for this particular spring system,
it turns out that the fundamental modes

78
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,850
are given by the eigenvectors
of the graph laplacian.

79
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,990
In fact, when we finally arrive
at our ultimate algorithm for

80
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,760
spectral partitioning, you'll be taking
a closer look at the eigenvectors.

81
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,670
But more on that later.
