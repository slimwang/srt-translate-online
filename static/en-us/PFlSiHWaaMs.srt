1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We put all these together, and we have a great series of hypotheses.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What's interesting is the word hypotheses.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I call that a $50 word.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That really sounds pretty important,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and I use it when I teach this class in universities.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But you know what?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The word hypotheses is really a fancy word for guesses,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and if you really think about it when you fill out the business model canvas

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
all you have is a series of guesses.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's it. That's all we have is a series of guesses.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What's great about the business model canvas is it allowed us to organize

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
our thinking not around functional organization like what is sales doing

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
or what's marketing doing or what does our spreadsheet say

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but just around a series of thoughtful first guesses

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
about who do we think our customers are and what products are we making for them,

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and how much are we going to charge, and that's great,

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and you could sit around all day or all week in your conference room

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
figuring out what those are.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But the odds are you're probably wrong, but it's a great first starting point,

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but the question is how do we change those guesses into facts?
