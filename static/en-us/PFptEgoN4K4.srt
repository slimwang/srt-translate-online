The solution for this equation is 5 halves, or two and a half. Nice work if you

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,942
got this one right. Again, we want to use the key idea of rewriting these with

3
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:16,787
the same base. I know 4 is 2 squared and I know 32 is 2 raised to the 5th. So,

4
00:00:16,787 --> 00:00:21,104
now I'm working towards having the same base. I want to combine these exponents

5
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:26,190
by multiplying. So, I'll have 2 to the 2x equals 2 to the 5th. I have 2 raised

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:32,048
to the 2x and 2 raised to the 5th. These must be equal, so I know that the

7
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:38,031
exponents have to be equal, since the bases are the same. So, we'll have 2x set

8
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:45,128
equal to 5. dividing both sides by 2 we find x is equal to 5 by 2
