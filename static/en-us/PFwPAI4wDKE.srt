Hi, my name is Aina. I'm a junior at Stanford University studying something

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,560
called Symbolic Systems. It's a combination of computer science, philosophy,

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,685
psychology, and linguistics. And within that, I'm focusing on human computer

4
00:00:12,685 --> 00:00:17,840
interactions. I actually entered Stanford as a pre-vet. I was going to be a

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,890
human biology major. I started taking the chemistry, biology, and physics

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,540
classes, and I was getting kind of bored, honestly. So, at the beginning of my

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,840
sophomore year, I took my first computer science class. I absolutely fell in

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,530
love with it, and I abandoned all things pre-vet, and it's been a marriage ever

9
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:35,910
since.
