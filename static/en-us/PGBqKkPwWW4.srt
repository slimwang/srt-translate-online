1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So the consequences of understanding a new market are essential for a startup.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This was a startup killer for decades.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In a new market, there are no customers, so revenues might extend out for years.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In fact, if you think about what happened during the dot-com bubble,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
in the beginning of the 21st century is every startup executed like they were in an existing market.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
They hired sales people, they spent marketing dollars, and in scale of tens of millions or dollars

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
trying to create and use your demands for a market that didn't exist.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Just imagine what would've happened if those start-ups would've parked their capital in a bank

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
getting interest and doing ??? activities to help start the market because the market wasn't there.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There is no way any individual startup can accelerate technology diffusion.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So for a new market to take off, lots of things external to your startup need to happen.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Regulation needs to change. Platforms need to become cheaper.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Customer cases need to change, etc.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The dot-com bubble was actually predicated on all these things happening all at once

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and they didn't, and therefore, all that money that got raised

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
got spent trying to acquire customers when they were none.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The test for whether you're in a new market is not whether 30 people in your regional cluster,

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
or in Silken Valley, or New York have heard about your technology.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The real test is whether your grandmother in Omaha or Berlin or in Uganda

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
actually have heard about the technology or the product or the market.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And if the market doesn't exist there, you might be spending a lot of money

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
trying to create a market where there is none.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Premature spending is the killer for startups.
