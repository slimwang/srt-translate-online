00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,620
When you're thinking about
a longer presentation,

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,110
it's often best to start with the
building blocks of your elevator pitch.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,430
The who, what and why for your app.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,240
And use that as a basic set up for
a story.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,180
You'll have to tailor the story
to your audience, but generally,

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,700
you can talk about a group of
people who have a problem, and

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,560
then talk about how your
app addresses that problem.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,430
To tailor your story to your audience.

9
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,580
Take time to present to someone like
the people you'll be presenting to and

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,950
ask them which parts
resonated with them.

11
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,751
It's very likely they care about
different parts of your app than you do.

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,010
You can make a story around
the development of your app as well.

13
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,570
Your prototyping process has given you
a lot of check points along the way, and

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,710
a lot of user feedback to work
with in building that story.

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,200
Often, the story will look
like we saw the problem and

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,570
came up with the solution,
that's your first prototype.

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,870
When we tested that solution though,

18
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,970
there were challenges
pointed out to us by users.

19
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,140
Because of their feedback,
we developed our concept further and

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,970
have arrived at this
shiny new prototype.

21
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,570
When you share your current
prototype with an audience,

22
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,330
be sure to share it natively.

23
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,430
If you're building an Android or

24
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,645
iOS app, pass some phones around the
table with your prototype pre-installed.

25
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:09,110
If you're building a web app,
make sure your audience has laptops and

26
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,250
can interact with it themselves.

27
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,580
You'll know you've done this right,

28
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,350
if people in the audience explore your
prototype, find something they like, and

29
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,810
show it to the person
sitting next to them.
