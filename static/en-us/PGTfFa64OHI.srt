1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:01,970
Hey.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:02,950
>> Hey.
>> What's going on?

3
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,442
>> Just wait for it.

4
00:00:04,442 --> 00:00:05,920
>> Okay.
>> Okay.

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,880
So, you know how we have a variable
called number of coffees

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,840
ordered in our app.

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,840
>> This box.
Yeah.

8
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,942
>> And we had the value two in it.

9
00:00:11,942 --> 00:00:14,600
>> Correct.
>> If I hit the plus button

10
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,180
in the app now.

11
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,500
>> Beep
>> Then

12
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,440
what is the number of
cups of coffee we have?

13
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,160
>> Well, that would be, increment by
one, so the new value should be three.

14
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,230
>> Yeah.
So I'm going to

15
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,105
throw out this old value and
put in this new one.

16
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:29,720
>> Okay.
>> If I hit the plus button

17
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,530
again-
>> Beep!

18
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,420
>> Then how many cups do I have?

19
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,630
>> Well now we will
increment that to four.

20
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,888
>> Yep.
>> So throw this out, add four in.

21
00:00:38,888 --> 00:00:40,630
>> Okay.
>> Now, if I hit the minus button-

22
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,160
>> Beep beep beep

23
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,830
>> Then how many cups of

24
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,380
coffee do I have?

25
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,476
>> But Catherine I thought you
said there would be no math?

26
00:00:46,476 --> 00:00:47,848
>> It's one.

27
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,520
Write that down.

28
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,240
Thanks.
>> Okay.

29
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,820
Here it is.

30
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,560
One.
>> Yep.

31
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,740
>> Let me give that to you.

32
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,820
>> Thank you.

33
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,420
Let's add all of this
into our app now and

34
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,680
we're going to work on your math later
Let's look at the pseudocode for how

35
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,000
clicking the plus button in the app can
increase the number of coffees ordered.

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,950
Pseudocode is a high level
description that explains

37
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,180
the steps of what the app will do.

38
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,650
We can write it out as if we're
describing it to someone,

39
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,810
because it's meant for
people to read, not computers.

40
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,270
This helps us put our thoughts into
a linear flow of what needs to happen

41
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,350
one step after the next.

42
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,630
When writing pseudocode we don't have
to follow any specific structure or

43
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,090
format, we just need to include useful
details that would help us write

44
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:28,980
the code later on.

45
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,450
For our scenario, we want to create
a quantity variable to keep track

46
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,080
of the number of coffees ordered and
we initialized the value to two coffees.

47
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,550
If the plus button is pressed, we can
update the quantity variable to three.

48
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,090
If we hit the plus button
several more times

49
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,850
we can increase the quantity to four and
five.

50
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,780
Once we have a conceptual idea in
our head of what the code should do,

51
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,600
then we can focus on writing
the actual Java code.

52
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,508
At this point then we can worry about
the syntax of Java, the capitalization,

53
00:01:58,508 --> 00:02:00,100
the symbols, the spacing and

54
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,160
other specific rules about
how to write Java code.

55
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,030
The real code would look like this
to create a quantity variable and

56
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,633
set it to two, we would have int
quantity = 2 followed by a ;.

57
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:13,440
This is what we covered
in the last video.

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,487
To update the quantity variable to 3 we
just need to say quantity = 3 followed

59
00:02:16,487 --> 00:02:17,140
by a semicolon.

60
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,670
If we update the quantity to 4 and 5,
this is what the code would look like.

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,570
For this quiz I want you to practice
typing out these lines of code

62
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,590
in the text fields provided.

63
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,440
This will give you practice in
creating an integer variable and

64
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,230
updating it in Java.

65
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,630
Pay close attention to each character
and symbol as you type this out.

66
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,540
When you're done, do you have any
observations about the format of

67
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,360
the code that you just typed out?

68
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,950
For example,
do you recognize any patterns?

69
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,190
Enter any observations
in this text field here.
