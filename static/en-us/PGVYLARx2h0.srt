1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's look at this result--after one time step, the temperature at position 0 equal 1 minus 4

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
times the time step times thermal diffusivity divided by the square of Δx.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What we want temperature should diffuse to the left and to the right.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Eventually, everything should ever reach out--in this case, to zero.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So we want to pick the step size in such a way that our function

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
eventually decays to zero as time tends to infinity.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What choice of time step do we have, does the time step have to be less than 1/4 * Δx²

8
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
divided by thermal diffusivity or twice that ratio or exactly that ratio or 1/2 that ratio.
