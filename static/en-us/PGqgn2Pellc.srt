1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The correct answer is 6 for the following missing links:

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
this guy here gives me two values in the matrix.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This guy here another two.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And this link here is also missing. That's another two. So 6 values are missing.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's prove it to ourselves. Moving from x0 to x1 fills up this area.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
From x1 to x2, this area.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Seeing landmark L0 from x0 and x1 means we fill these guys over here.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and the main diagonal there.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Seeing the other landmark from x1 and x2 means we fill these guys over here.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's count the ones that are still open, and here are the ones.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My answer was actually wrong. It's 8.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I overlooked there is no direct link from L1 to L2 either.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My apologies that I gave you the wrong number,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
but it proves to you this is actually not an easy question. It's harder than I thought.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The reason is there is also no direct link that constrains L1 and L2 directly.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Landmarks can't see, so they can't put a direct link between any two landmarks.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Or put differently, in this part over here our matrix will always be a diagonal matrix.
