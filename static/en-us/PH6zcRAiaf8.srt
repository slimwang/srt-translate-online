00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,860
Through this lesson, I'm sure you have

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,780
a good understanding and appreciation for the hard

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,380
work in the implementation of an operating

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,790
system on a shared memory multiprocessor that ensures

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,700
capability of the basic mechanisms like synchronization,

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,210
communication, and scheduling. And this is not done

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,800
just once. It has to be done a new, for every new parallel architecture that

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,720
comes to market that has a vastly different

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,619
memory hierarchy compared to its predecessors. Can we

10
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:37,000
reduce the pin point of individually optimizing every

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,880
operating system that runs on a multi-processor? Now

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,920
what about device drivers, that form a big part of the code base of an operating

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,980
system? Do we have to reimplement them for

14
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,050
every flavor of operating systems that runs on a

15
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,960
new machine? Can we leverage third party device

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,160
drivers from the OEM's to reduce the pain point?
