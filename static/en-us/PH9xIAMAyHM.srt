1
00:00:00,243 --> 00:00:03,423
So now, with the cloud,
you can play across your devices.

2
00:00:03,423 --> 00:00:06,913
And all your data is saved
automatically for you, which is great.

3
00:00:06,913 --> 00:00:08,929
But what about if you lose the game?

4
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:12,652
Maybe a game is like Flappy Bird and
you lose every few seconds, or

5
00:00:12,652 --> 00:00:13,609
is that just me?

6
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:14,770
Do you stop playing?

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,082
Of course not.

8
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:19,350
You keep going for a while and
try to beat your record.

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,320
And this is because it's so
easy to keep playing.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,560
Flappy Bird lets you crash and

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,020
burn, then start over just
by tapping the screen.

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,830
This is a lot easier than classic
arcade games where when you lose,

13
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,520
you have to type in your
name to record a game score.

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,730
And then insert more quarters
if you want to play again.

15
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,470
So to keep your players interested,

16
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,160
it's important to include
an easy restart in your game.
