00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,770
For this programming exercise, you need to create a variable

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,500
called, year joined bucket. That bin together users depending on

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,740
which year they joined Facebook. So, for example, this would

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,750
be one bucket, this would be one bucket, this would be

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,420
a bucket, and then these users would be another bucket.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,877
To do this, we just need to use the cut function

7
00:00:18,877 --> 00:00:21,634
on the variable year joined. I just need to tell

8
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:25,128
Cut, on what years I should split my data. So I'm

9
00:00:25,128 --> 00:00:32,537
going to split at 2004, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2014.

10
00:00:32,537 --> 00:00:36,440
Running this code, I can see that I got a new variable inside of my data frame.
