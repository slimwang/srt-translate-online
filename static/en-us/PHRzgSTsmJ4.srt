00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,764
Okay, so here's my answer.

2
00:00:01,764 --> 00:00:02,809
It depends!

3
00:00:02,809 --> 00:00:04,365
Lame!

4
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:06,339
What I really mean is,
it depends what you want.

5
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,520
Do you want work optimality?

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,420
Do you want low-span?

7
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,580
Do you want linear speed-up?

8
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,930
Do you want better execution time?

9
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,430
Depending on the metric you choose,
you can derive a different response.

10
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,420
Now there are a lot
of cases to consider.

11
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,780
I won't go through them all.

12
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,750
Instead I'll refer you to
the instructor's notes, which includes

13
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,270
a pointer to a short reading that
compares these different scenarios.
