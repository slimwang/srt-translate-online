00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's take a look at the first piece called the value proposition.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The value proposition answers the question what are you building and for who?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The value proposition says, "Hey, it's not about your ideal product,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
it's about solving a problem or a need for a customer."

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That is what pain are you solving, what gain are you creating,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and more importantly, who are your customers?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now value proposition is a fancy word for what product or service are you building.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is where you normally would list all your features and

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
here's all the speeds and feeds and benefits and whatever but we're really going to

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
be asking a different question than might have been used to.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's not all about your technology. Your technology is just part of the value proposition.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Customers really don't care about your technology.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The customers are trying to solve a problem or fulfill a need.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
By the way, we'll be talking about this for multiple lectures.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The difference between a problem and a need is--a problem is I have an accounting problem

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
or I want to use the word processor, and those type of products solve a problem,

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but they are other things that human beings do--like I want to be entertained or I want to have a date.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
There's just some basic hard wired social need or I want to communicate with my friends.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Like Facebook or Twitter. Those are needs. Needs are different than problems.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And by the way, if you could find products that solve needs, your total available market

21
00:01:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
as you'll see later is huge compared to I solve specific problems.
