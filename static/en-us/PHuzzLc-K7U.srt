1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,330
So the scenario here is kind
of little interesting one.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,770
There is a particular user.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,340
The user does belong.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,930
User is Alice,
she does belong to this group.

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:14,010
The system specifies that members
of this group can read file foo so

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,970
that's a positive access right.

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:21,640
Think of that as plus read says in the
column it's going to be for file foo,

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,890
the row is going to be for this subject
All-Students we're talking about.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,280
And if you look at, in the entry in the
access control matrix corresponding to

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,880
this subject and to this object or file.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,790
Then it's going to say, there's.

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,130
They're allowed to read it,
but Alice is denied access.

13
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,810
Maybe Alice is no longer a student,

14
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,740
a member of this group
that we are talking about.

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:50,910
So if you look at Alice's entry for
this file foo, okay, so the role

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,980
would be Alice's role in the access
control metrics, and the column is foo.

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,500
If you go in there,
then access is denied.

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,430
So we have a negative
read that says Alice

19
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,450
should not be allowed to read this part.

20
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,400
We're exploring a couple of different
questions here or ideas here.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,100
We're exploring the idea of a group and
users being part of a group.

22
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,870
The idea of a positive access right
as well as a negative access right.

23
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,870
And actually the important thing
that this question is exploring is

24
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,890
what happens when you run
into a situation where

25
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,230
you kind of seems like
you have a conflict?

26
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:27,260
Where Alice is a member of this
group and the group has access.

27
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,830
But then if you look at Alice herself,
she is denied access to this file.

28
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,260
So what does enforcement
do in this case?

29
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,036
That's the question you are exploring in
this quiz, and there are two options.
