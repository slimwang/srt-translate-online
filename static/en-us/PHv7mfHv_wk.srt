1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,450
Okay, and the correct answer is, as you may have

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:07,092
suspected, all of these. There are many different factors in each

3
00:00:07,092 --> 00:00:10,596
website, is a little bit different. And, you know, different website

4
00:00:10,596 --> 00:00:15,111
may have different needs. some, some websites you know, video websites,

5
00:00:15,111 --> 00:00:18,710
like YouTube or Justin TV. Bandwidth was a major factor

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,580
because video takes a lot of bandwidth. And you have to

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,470
figure out, you know, how you can support that much bandwidth.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,210
You know, you're sending a lot of data over the wire,

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,680
over the Internet. Machines, computers very often CPU's a limiting factor. if,

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,300
if your website does a lot of computation you know, you may need

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,850
a lot computers to handle all of the traffic, to do computation

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,940
for everybody. Or maybe you're running out of memory. You know, you're storing

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,740
a lot of data or you're caching a lot of data in

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,580
memory. You may need to store that data across many computers to, to

15
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,850
make it work. Power, you know, if you're adding a lots of

16
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,870
computers, power is actually something you

17
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,079
need to start thinking about. You know,

18
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,291
I've visited Google once and it was cool that had a,

19
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:56,284
a map on the wall of where the big power plants

20
00:00:56,284 --> 00:00:59,620
in the world were. They are building data centers in near

21
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,010
power plants so they could always have powers. And storage, of course,

22
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,580
is similar to memory. You know, memory, disk space, or technologies

23
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,040
that fall in, in between. You know if, if you're storing a

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,600
lot of data. You know many websites store a lot of

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,309
data. If users are submitting content to you, photos and status updates,

26
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:18,011
and, you know, comments and that sort of thing. That

27
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,261
starts to become a big factor in, in your decision making,

28
00:01:21,261 --> 00:01:23,790
and how do you store all of that data. Facebook

29
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,310
has so many photos, they have to. They've unbelievable amount of

30
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,820
disk space required to, to manage all that information and

31
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,328
you know Google has basically the entire internet indexed and you

32
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:37,107
know that they have to store, they basically Google's [INAUDIBLE] entire

33
00:01:37,107 --> 00:01:40,420
internet across all their machines so they can do searches quickly.

34
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,390
So all of these are things you need

35
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,450
to scale and of course there are other, other

36
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,710
things as well but I just want you

37
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,730
to keep in mind that every website is different.

38
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,140
Every website has different needs and different limiting,

39
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,290
limiting factors whether it's machines or bandwidth or power.

40
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,080
Anything can be the, the, the culprit when it

41
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,560
comes to keeping your website online, stable and fast.
