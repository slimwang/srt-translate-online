00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,477
Here's the filled in version of the table. You'll notice that we did end up with

2
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:08,824
one spot in this far right column where we had to write undefined and that was

3
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:13,310
where x equals 4. We set x equal to 4, the denominator here becomes 0. And since

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,666
we know that division is not allowed, it's not something we can interpret using

5
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:21,930
our algebra skills, you have to write undefined in this box. It makes the entire

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,441
fraction, the entire rational expression undefined. Whereas, when we were

7
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:29,121
dealing with quadratic inequalities, we were multiplying two factors together.

8
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:32,668
Now, we're dividing them. But what's interesting to note is that we have the

9
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,323
same relationship between signs of the first two columns and the sign of the

10
00:00:36,323 --> 00:00:40,586
third column. If we're dividing two negative numbers, we get a positive number.

11
00:00:40,586 --> 00:00:44,372
If we're dividing a negative by a positive or the reverse, a positive by a

12
00:00:44,372 --> 00:00:48,505
negative, we get a negative number. And if we're dividing two positive numbers,

13
00:00:48,505 --> 00:00:52,417
we get a positive. Of course, zero is the exception, 0 divided by any number,

14
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:56,567
regardless of positive or negative, is 0. And any number, whether positive or

15
00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:59,863
negative divided by 0, is going to give us an undefined answer.
