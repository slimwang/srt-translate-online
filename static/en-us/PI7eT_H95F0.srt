00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,566
In this exercise, you'll implement a rear view camera. It's not quite a rear

2
00:00:03,566 --> 00:00:07,344
view mirror. Because left and right will not be reversed. Right now, the rear

3
00:00:07,344 --> 00:00:10,570
view camera is just focused on the center of the model. The position and target

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,350
never change. Your job is to make the rear view camera actually look backwards.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,700
Directly away from whatever the full screen camera is looking at. For its

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,170
position, use the same position as the forward camera. You'll probably need to

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,159
use the camera's look at method. As well as some vector three methods. At least

8
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:28,780
I did. I've set up the two view ports. The one tricky bit in the code is that

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,020
scissoring is implemented. A scissor box defines a part of the screen that you

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,193
want to clear. This is needed so that the rear view camera view port properly

11
00:00:35,193 --> 00:00:39,324
clears its area on the screen, since it overlaps the larger view port. See the

12
00:00:39,324 --> 00:00:40,799
code to see what I'm talking about.
