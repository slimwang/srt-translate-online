1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,790
Anything that involves actual
money is considered a transaction.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,600
So in concrete terms,
that means that the purchases and

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,010
refunds are transactions.

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,890
For purchases,
the action is ACTION_PURCHASE,

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,600
and you must set the quantity for
product.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,220
After all,
if the user's buying zero products,

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,500
there's no purchase taking place.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,400
You also need to send
the transaction ID.

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,010
Each transaction ID must be unique.

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:36,430
And you set the transaction ID calling
setTransactionId on the productAction.

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,160
So go ahead and
add a purchase button to your app.

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,530
You should know the drill by now.

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,340
Add the purchase button
to the layout file.

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,480
Define the method to purchase the cart.

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,180
Skeleton code only.

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,770
And to send the analytics hit.

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,480
Don't forget, we need the full
implementation of the method that sends

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,640
the purchase hit to Analytics.

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,870
And this method is going to need
to set the unique transaction ID.

20
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,930
One way to make unique transaction
id is to concatenate the product id

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,379
with CurrentTime.

22
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,490
We'll supply the code to do
this if you want to use it.

23
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,754
You'll need to add the code
to the utility class.

24
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:14,807
Course, you're welcome to
invent your own way to generate

25
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:16,096
unique transaction ID.

26
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:18,869
Then you'll need to update
the start checkout button so

27
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,200
that it hides itself and
shows the purchase button.

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,440
And then run the app and
buy some dinners.
