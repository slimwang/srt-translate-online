00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,140
Okay. So we are back to the code and all

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:06,210
I have done is added the translate function to our program.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,560
So what this code is doing now, is saying, for

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,330
each file or for each photo, inside our folder, rename it.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,870
Here is the old file name and here is the

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,070
new file name devoid of any numbers. Now my hypothesis is

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,710
that if I save and run this program, all of the

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,260
photo files will be renamed and we'll see the secret message.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,370
So let me go ahead and save it and run the program.

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,670
Oh wow. That clearly did not work. Would you

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,210
mind reading through this editor and telling us what

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,300
you think is the problem? Once you have a

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,020
hypothesis, feel free to enter it into the box provided.
