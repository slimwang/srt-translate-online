1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Narrator] And the answer is west.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
If you're over here, and we go east,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
we'd likely end up with minus 100.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you go north, which seems to be the intuitive answer,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
there's a 10% chance we fall into the minus 100.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
However, if we go west, then there's absolutely

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
no chance we fall into the minus 100.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We might find ourselves over here.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We might be in the same state. We might find ourselves over here,

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
but from these states over here,

11
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
there's safe policies that can safely avoid the minus 100.
