00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,680
We saw before that with a 15 decibel increase, our power is going to double 5

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,170
times. So, what does that actually mean? Well, it means if we have some power

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,240
P, we're going to double it, or multiply it by 2, and then do that again, and

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:24,020
again, and again, and again. Which means we are multiplying P by 2, five times.

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,703
That's the same as multiplying the power by 2 to the 5th power. And 2 to the

6
00:00:29,703 --> 00:00:37,438
5th is 32. So that means that a 100 decibel sound is 32 times as powerful as an

7
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:39,540
85 decibel one.
