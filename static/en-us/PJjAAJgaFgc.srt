1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:00,890
Awesome.

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,560
At this point you have
completed localizing the text

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,160
in the Just Java app.

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,000
Hopefully you've seen that
with just a few modifications,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,860
you can open up your app
to whole new audiences.

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,888
Let's review our solution.

7
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:14,400
Here's the strings.xml file

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,380
where we pulled out all
the possible strings in our app.

9
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,790
For each string resource
we provide a comment.

10
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,972
And a character limit to help
the translator figure out the right

11
00:00:22,972 --> 00:00:24,341
translation.

12
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:27,630
In our layout now we refer
to string resources.

13
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,990
There are no more warnings from Android
Studio about hardcoding strings in

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,275
our layout.

15
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:36,235
And here's the Spanish version
of the strings.xml file

16
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:38,785
with all the Spanish translations.

17
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:42,045
If you open up the translations editor
you can see the name of the string

18
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:45,046
resources, the English translations
as well as the Spanish translations.

19
00:00:46,307 --> 00:00:49,487
Then in our layout file we can refer
to all of these string resources.

20
00:00:49,487 --> 00:00:53,337
And now Android Studio doesn't have
anymore warnings about hard coding

21
00:00:53,337 --> 00:00:54,647
strings in our layout.

22
00:00:54,647 --> 00:00:58,303
Within our Java code we also
refer to these string resources.

23
00:00:58,303 --> 00:01:02,133
Note that we also get the local
currency with this line of code here.

24
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:06,983
This is a utility function that formats
the input price into the currency for

25
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,173
the current locale.

26
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:11,403
All of the solution code is linked
in the instructor notes below.

27
00:01:11,403 --> 00:01:13,593
Buen trabajo, great job.

28
00:01:13,593 --> 00:01:16,213
Now let's explore further
about what else can be done

29
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:17,513
with resources in Android.
