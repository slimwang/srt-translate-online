00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,490
So to conclude this lecture,
let me summarize what we've learned.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,350
In this lecture, I've given you
more details about image warping.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,270
We've covered a variety of topics on
how we can actually do much more of

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:16,040
the non-rigid effects like spherical,
and also defamation of images.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,520
Specifically talked about
the basics of forward and

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,460
inverse warping applied
to image transformations.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,960
Then actually extended the whole
approach to take a mesh and

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,920
use that to warp an image.

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,272
We looked at both triangular and
quadrilateral meshes, used that to

10
00:00:30,272 --> 00:00:34,203
introduce the concept of image morphing
and then discussed variety of methods,

11
00:00:34,203 --> 00:00:37,036
including how we can do
feature-based image morphing and

12
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:39,750
different applications
of image morphing.

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,750
For full details, I recommend
you look at the classic paper

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,880
on feature-based image metamorphosis.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,880
This is the paper that actually was used
as a foundation of some of the effects

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,390
that we've seen in this class.

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,340
And of course, the chapter three of Ri,

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,820
Szeliski's book also has more details
on all forms of image transformations.
