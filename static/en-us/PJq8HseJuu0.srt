1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,405
So we simply take the difference between

2
00:00:02,405 --> 00:00:06,738
the vertex's entry in the R array and its neighbors entry in the R array,

3
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:09,579
and that's going to show how many neighbors this particular entry has.

4
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:12,483
So it's just R of V plus 1 minus R of V.

5
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:17,112
Earlier, we said the R array was 1 longer than we needed, and this is the reason why.

6
00:00:17,112 --> 00:00:20,915
So what's the starting point of the next vertex? Subtract my starting point.

7
00:00:20,915 --> 00:00:24,168
So in our example, node 1 has 3 neighbors, 5 minus 2,

8
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:27,002
and node 3 has 1 neighbor, 6 minus 5.

9
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:32,064
So the new frontier then has a maximum number of 3 plus 1 nodes in it.
