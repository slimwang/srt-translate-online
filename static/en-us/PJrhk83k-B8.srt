00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,235
This problem we're going to start of with a template

2
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:05,080
for a recursively generated graph. If the template says if I

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,440
want one node, it'll just return a single node. For

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,560
other values, make a G1 and a G2 that are half

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,160
the size. And then we make log n connections between

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,940
G1 and G2 by picking a random point and connecting with

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,990
a random node, another random node. And connecting with a random

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,520
node etc. And then return. So this has the recurrence relationship

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,265
that only have one node with zero edges. And if

10
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:32,706
we have n nodes, we get 2 times the number of

11
00:00:32,706 --> 00:00:35,775
nodes we have for a graph of half the size

12
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:38,590
plus big theta of log n. And so what we want

13
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,730
you to do is to solve this recurrence. But we

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,440
are going to do this one little differently, than some of

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,930
our previous homework assignments. Instead of a multiple choice question, we

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,760
want you to explain how to actually solve this. So below

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,730
there's a form link, and at that link you'll see

18
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,780
this question restated. We want you to do is wirte up

19
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,680
your answer, post your response to the form, get the link

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,640
for your answer. And then insert it here. I'll give an

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,129
example to make this more clear. So here's the question on

22
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,110
the forum. And you should write up your answer. Some possible

23
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,510
answers might be that T of n is theta log n,

24
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,800
theta n log n, theta n, theta n squared. There's any

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,390
other function. And then you should explain why you've

26
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,730
answered like this. Or just submit your answer. Hit

27
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,540
the link button. Copy out the link. Now, if

28
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,830
you've copied the link, paste it into the box here.
