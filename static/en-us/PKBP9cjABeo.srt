1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,050
Let me show you one of
the earlier examples using this

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,140
in a way that was kind of intriguing.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,300
Moghaddam and Yang, they did some nice
work on gender classification, okay?

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,520
So given a face, can you tell me
whether it's a man or a woman?

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,680
That's it, that's it basically.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,550
And what they were doing is you can
see they were just cropping out

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,020
sort of the center of the face here.

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,530
In order to do that, they had some they
had some machinery to take this image.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,480
I think this is still the the old Mayor,
I think it's Mayor White of

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,270
Boston a while back, and essentially
finds the face, scales it, finds the,

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,850
the, the features, can warp it and
straighten it out and

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,000
then cut out just the part of
the face that they want, okay?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,240
So they can automatically go gener,
remember, generate the candidate?

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,620
They can automatically generate
the candidates, all right?

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,380
So they trained it.

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,492
Their training examples
had about 1000 men,

17
00:00:51,492 --> 00:00:56,510
700 women which is a pretty
reasonable ratio in academic labs,

18
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,460
but really, they should have tried to,
to balance it.

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,560
The images were shrunk down to
being only 21 by 12 pixels, okay?

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,625
So, it's a relatively small feature.

21
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:12,089
It's still got, whatever,
21 times 12 is, let's see, 210 and

22
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:14,900
42 times, so 252 numbers, right?

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,760
But, they're not just
going to base it on that.

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,193
They actually used a Gaussian kernel,
okay?

25
00:01:22,193 --> 00:01:23,988
A Gaussian RBF.

26
00:01:23,988 --> 00:01:28,240
So that's defined as xi and xj, and
when you compute some new input,

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,180
x against your support vectors,
so here is kx,

28
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,230
so x is your new input, and
the xj is each of the support vector.

29
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,530
So you have to compute this
quantity at testing time,

30
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,110
in order to determine whether
it's a man or a woman, okay?

31
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,070
What's interesting is,

32
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,642
remember we had support vectors
which were actually the points.

33
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:53,340
All right, and these are the points
that are sort of the harder points.

34
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,240
Right?
They're the ones near the boundary.

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,060
Well, we still have support vectors.

36
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,480
But now,
you can call these things support faces.

37
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,770
Remember eigenfaces?

38
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,300
And by the way, Babock Magadon
was a student of Sandy Pendleton.

39
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,370
Sandy Pendleton, Matt Terk,
the people who do the eigenface,

40
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,651
and then Babock did his own thing
on parts of faces and face space.

41
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:15,370
All right, but what you can do is you
can now find the support vectors which

42
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,480
in some sense, are the the faces that
are closest to the boundary, right?

43
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,260
In some sense they sh,

44
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,530
not in some sense, they are the faces
that are sort of harder to, to label.

45
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,140
Okay?

46
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,832
So male versus female,
you can see these are pretty similar,

47
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:33,855
all right, these are pretty similar, and
yet, one is, one is male, one is female.

48
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:35,165
Here's another example.

49
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:36,465
Maybe this one's not so hard.

50
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:40,655
So, this is just some of
the support vector's faces.

51
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:41,925
Well, what's kind of nice about this,

52
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:45,225
is that they trained a variety
of classifiers, all right?

53
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:47,355
Here they are,
some simple nearest neighbor,

54
00:02:47,355 --> 00:02:48,705
which you could see down at the bottom.

55
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:54,315
A Fisher linear discriminant, which
says, let me try to find a single line

56
00:02:54,315 --> 00:03:00,100
that separates things the best, but
in the original, dimensional space.

57
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,260
Then they tried a variety of methods,
and what's really cool is the SVM, all

58
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,120
right, the Sport Vector Machine with the
radial basis function, the Gaussian one,

59
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,810
only had an error rate of like 3.4%,
which is pretty good.

60
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,810
In fact, how good is it?

61
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,285
Well, you should see what,
how well can humans do on this data set?

62
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:26,770
'because remember, they just cropped
the middle of the face, all right?

63
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,320
So, they did a test with people,

64
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,590
where they had 30 subjects 22 male,
eight female.

65
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,800
That's also closer to an academic lab,
typically.

66
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,668
And their test data was 254 faces.

67
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:43,860
60% male, 40% female.

68
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,810
I don't know why they wouldn't use
50 50, but that's what they did.

69
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,700
They used low-res versions and
high-res versions.

70
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,710
We'll get to that in a minute.

71
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,160
And then the task was,
is it male or female?

72
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,410
We'll give you all day to decide,
but you have to make a choice.

73
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,510
You can't say I don't know, and
you can take as long as you want.
