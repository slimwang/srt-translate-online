00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,793
No game has perfect retention, but
many game developers use the 40-20-10

2
00:00:05,793 --> 00:00:11,010
rule to measure if the retention is good
over every day, a week, and a month.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,300
For a game that starts with
200 players on a certain day,

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,820
what is considered good retention
using the 40-20-10 rule?

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,650
>> For the game with 200 players,
your measures for retention are,

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,620
100 of those players leave
after the first 24 hours.

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,600
70 of those players stay after one day.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,140
40 of those players stay after one week.

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,240
Or 100 new players join a week later.
