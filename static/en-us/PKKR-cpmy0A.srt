packing is a type of bin packing problem that has been proved to be np hard. The

problem is so challenging, that I frequently use a variant of this algorithm as

an interview question to evaluate the skill of potential hires, GRITS, rather

00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:23,240
writing our own version of texture packing. Grits uses texture packer, which is

a great off-the-shelf tool that fits into most content pipelines quickly. It

will generate the atlas data given a list of loose textures, alongside a data

atlas.
