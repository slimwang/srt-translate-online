In the previous question we had this polynomial, y equals x cubed, which has an

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,384
odd degree. It starts really low on the left hand side and then it increases

3
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:12,926
and increases until it's ending up high on the right side. Now what if instead

4
00:00:12,926 --> 00:00:16,376
of a polynomial was an odd degree like this one? We have one with an even

5
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:20,225
degree, like this one, y equals x to the 4th. Tell me about this graph on the

6
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:23,920
left hand side over here. Is it coming from up high or is it coming from down

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,689
low?
