1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,670
Let's walk through
the solution step by step.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,740
First, when specifying the parameters,

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,890
the request token method
only needs the API key.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,780
So, we can just create
this empty dictionary,

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,650
because the task forget method will
add the API key when we call it.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,329
Now when we call the task forget method,

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,920
we want to use the method
authentication token new, and

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,180
then we'll pass in our parameters, and
now we need to move on to step three.

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,790
First, we'll check to see
if an error was returned.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,350
If an error is returned we'll print it,
and

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,619
then we'll call our completion handler
for token, we'll pass, success is false,

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,950
there's no request token, it's nil,
and we'll give some error strain.

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,390
Otherwise, we need to pull the request
token out of the results, so

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,150
we'll look at the request
token key here.

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,220
We'll grab a request token.

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,750
And then we'll call the completion
handler for token where success is true.

17
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,330
We'll pass our request token.

18
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,560
And there's no error string.

19
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,290
Or, if we can't find the key,
then we'll handle that accordingly here.

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,150
Let's go ahead and run this,
and see what happens.

21
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,810
If everything works correctly,

22
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,730
then when I click this button,
it'll start our off flow.

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,620
And there's our request token.

24
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,840
Now, all the steps we've taken to
get back to this point may seem like

25
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,920
a lot of work for
what we already did, or

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,830
something that we did
similarly in lesson three.

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,540
But, that's the wrong mindset.

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,800
By splitting our code up like this,
it becomes much easier to manage.

29
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,785
And as we move forward,

30
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:23,180
it'll be easier to add new methods
to interact with the movie database.
