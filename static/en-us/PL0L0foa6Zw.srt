1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,940
Now suppose Bob wants to
access the printer HP1.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,850
That is, Bob wants to send
a print job to the printer HP1.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:12,360
His local host sends a ticket
granting service request to the KDC.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,920
The request contains the ticket
granting ticket and a authenticator.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,820
Which is the current
time stamp encrypted.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,360
Using Bob's per day session key, SB.

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,650
When the KDC gets the request,
it can decrypt the TGT.

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,530
And it knows that it is a valid TGT.

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:34,780
Because only the KDC has the key
to properly encrypt the ID of Bob

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,600
contained in the TGT.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,490
It then uses the key,

12
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:43,920
SB, contained in the TGT to verify
the authenticator by decrypting it.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,450
And checking the time stamp is current.

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:51,590
This proves that the sender is Bob,
because only Bob has the key SB.

15
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,272
That can encrypt the current
time stamp properly.

16
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:58,690
The KDC then generates a ticket for
Bob to communicate with the printer.

17
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,220
This ticket contains
a session key KBP and

18
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,250
Bob's ID and its encrypted
using the printer's master key.

19
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,290
Note that a network device such
as a printer has a long and

20
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,920
random master key configured in.

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,475
And it's typically hard to guess or
crack.

22
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:20,610
Therefore, the tickets for these devices
are encrypted using their master keys.

23
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,040
The KDC sends a ticket granting
service response to Bob's local host.

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,700
It contains a session key KBP.

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,100
The ID of Bob and
the ticket to the printer and

26
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,650
it is encrypted using
Bob's private key Sb.

27
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,690
Therefore, only Bob's local
station can decrypt this, and

28
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,290
verify that it is from the KDC.

29
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,450
Because only the KDC can decrypt the ID
of Bob correctly with the key SP.

30
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:53,190
Because the key sp is embedded in TGT
and only the KDC can decrypt the TGT.

31
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,210
Then Bob's local host can
authenticate itself to the printer.

32
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,230
It can send a message to
the printer containing the ticket.

33
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:05,800
The authentication request contains
the ticket and an authenticator.

34
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,380
The authenticator is the server text
of the current timestamp encrypted.

35
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,560
Using a share key between Bob's
local host and the printer.

36
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,310
When the printer gets the ticket,

37
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,260
it can decrypt the ticket using his
master key shared with the KDC.

38
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,610
Because the ticket was
created by the KDC.

39
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,540
And it was encrypted using the share
key between the printer and the KDC.

40
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,590
That is,
the printer can verify that the KBP

41
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,350
was created by the KDC,
to communicate with Bob's Local Host.

42
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,860
The print server can then use KBP

43
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,310
to verify the authenticator by
decrypting the server text and

44
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,780
verifying that the result matches
with the current time stamp.

45
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,330
It then sends a response to
authenticate itself by say,

46
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,060
adding one to the current timestamp and
encrypt it.

47
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,840
Using the share key between
Bob's Local Host and the printer.

48
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,910
And after this, authentication steps,

49
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,140
then Bob's Local Host can send
a print drop to the printer.
