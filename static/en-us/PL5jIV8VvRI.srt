1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,110
The answer is that these
two edges don't belong.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,950
All of the other edges are either within
clause edges, which we always include,

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,610
or they connect contradictory literals,
a and a bar, b and b bar, etc.

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,160
These two edges connect
literals that are the same, and

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,850
we don't want to include these edges for

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,430
reasons that become clear with
an understanding of the proof.
