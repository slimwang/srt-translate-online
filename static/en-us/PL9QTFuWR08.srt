Jack is having his birthday
in a couple weeks and

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,032
there are a number of gifts I need
to buy and put together for him.

3
00:00:05,032 --> 00:00:09,204
I've extended the jack object with
the backbones event functions.

4
00:00:09,204 --> 00:00:12,571
And this is how jack's events
object needs to end up.

5
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:14,376
I need you to help me get prepped for

6
00:00:14,376 --> 00:00:17,179
the birthday party by calling
backbones on method and

7
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:22,090
passing it the correct information to
make jack's event object look like this.

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,580
The catch is that you need to do
this using just two calls to on,

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,990
see if you can figure it out.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,500
If you get stuck pop open the DEV tools
and walk through backbones on method.
