00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:07,294
Log base 5 of 9 is equal to log base e of 9 over log base e of 5. Or in other

2
00:00:07,294 --> 00:00:12,982
words ln of 9 over ln of 5. Now, it's time to bring out our calculator. So we

3
00:00:12,982 --> 00:00:19,531
plug in ln of 9 divided by ln of 5. And here we go, we get the same decimal

4
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:27,415
that we did before. 1.36521238897 and continuing. This is, of course, rounded.

5
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:31,767
Great. The important thing is that this number is equal to what we had when we

6
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:37,682
converted to base 10 instead base e. That means that regardless of what we set

7
00:00:37,682 --> 00:00:41,626
b our new base equal to, the original expression log base 5 of 9 has this

8
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:44,669
value. Awesome.
