00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,752
A good example of this, relating to the brain, is a trait called Huntington's

2
00:00:04,752 --> 00:00:09,884
Disease. Huntington's disease, is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects

3
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:15,140
muscle coordination and results in cognitive decline and psychiatric problems.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,460
Caused by a marked degeneration of brain tissue, that's visible in this

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,000
picture. Comparing a Huntington's Disease brain on the left to normal brain

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,572
tissue here on the right. Typically, Huntington's Disease becomes noticeable in

7
00:00:31,572 --> 00:00:38,049
mid adult life. So if the allele for Huntington's Disease is dominant. Then

8
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:42,401
which of the following allele combinations would result in someone who actually

9
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:50,434
displays Huntington's Disease? Remember, humans have two copies of every gene.

10
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:55,727
We'll represent the allele for Huntington's Disease with the letters HD and the

11
00:00:55,727 --> 00:01:02,422
allele for normal brain function with the abbreviation NORM. Would it be

12
00:01:02,422 --> 00:01:08,881
somebody who has two HD alleles. An individual with one HD and one NORM allele

13
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:14,776
or an individual with two NORM alleles. Go ahead and select any and all answers

14
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:16,910
that you think apply. [BLANK_AUDIO]
