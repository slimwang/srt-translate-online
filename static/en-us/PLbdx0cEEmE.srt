1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The only one that is necessary is the second one--

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
if the attacker doesn't know anything about the key.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
A one-time pad is a perfect cipher, and as a perfect cipher,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
the computation power of the adversary is irrelevant.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The first one is not true.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The second statement is true, because if an attacker knows something about the key,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
she or he will know something about the message,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
which would compromise the confidentiality.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It is not necessary to assume that the attacker cannot modify the message.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Modifying the message only effects the integrity of the message,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but that does not effect the confidentiality.
