Hi there. My name's Lyla and

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,449
I'm a course developer here at Udacity.

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,410
Today, I'm going to be taking you
through how to install Android studio.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,379
If you want to know
what Android studio is,

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,374
it's our development environment of
choice for creating Android apps.

6
00:00:13,374 --> 00:00:16,760
And we pick Android studio because
once you've got everything set up and

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,390
your phone or

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,360
emulators connected, you can make a
hello world app in a matter of minutes.
