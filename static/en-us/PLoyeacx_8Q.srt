00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,991
We said earlier that the cost to make 92 glasses wiper sets is going to depend

2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:07,886
on the cost to make one wiper set, which is choice a, and also the number of

3
00:00:07,898 --> 00:00:11,806
wiper sets total that are made, choice c. So, I know that a and c are going to

4
00:00:11,818 --> 00:00:15,765
be the letters that go in these boxes, but I need to think about the operator

5
00:00:15,777 --> 00:00:19,838
that I want between them before I can decide which one goes in the first box and

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,044
which one in the second. Or, if that order matters at all. In previous lessons,

7
00:00:24,056 --> 00:00:27,916
we thought about how total money spent is equal to the money spent per unit

8
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:31,284
times the number of units that are being made. So, if we want to make two

9
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:35,125
glasses wipers instead of one, we're going to pay twice as much money. If you

10
00:00:35,137 --> 00:00:38,468
wanted to make three wipers sets, we're going to spend three times as much

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,685
money, and so on and so forth. So, we need to multiply these two quantities, a

12
00:00:42,697 --> 00:00:46,710
and c, together. I'm going to go ahead and fill in a multiplication sign in this

13
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:50,640
box. We learned earlier from the commutative property of multiplication that

14
00:00:50,652 --> 00:00:54,730
when we're multiplying two things together, order doesn't matter. So, it doesn't

15
00:00:54,742 --> 00:00:58,410
matter if I have a or c in this box, or a or c in this box. As long as I have

16
00:00:58,422 --> 00:01:01,095
one in one spot and one in the other, we are good to go.
