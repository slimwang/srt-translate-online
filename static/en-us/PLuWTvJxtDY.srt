1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,820
I'm here with Jarrod Parkes who
is a course developer at Udacity.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,520
Thank you so much for
talking to us today, Jarrod.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,290
>> Thanks for having me.

4
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,120
>> We're going to talk a little
bit about student isolation, and

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,580
especially student isolation as
it arises in online classes.

6
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,190
I wanted to talk to Jarrod about this,
because, Jarrod,

7
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,210
you have unique experience in three
different ways on this topic.

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,030
One is as the student of online classes.

9
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,250
One is as the designer
of online classes.

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,835
And one is also as a remote employee.

11
00:00:21,835 --> 00:00:23,680
Jarrod works for
Udacity in Mountain View, but

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,540
actually works out of
his home in Alabama.

13
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,520
So that's kind of three interesting
takes on the angle of isolation.

14
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,380
So let's start with the class, with
the experience as a student in a class.

15
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,900
So what's your experience
being a student in

16
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,070
an online class where you might not be
colocated with your fellow students?

17
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,430
>> So every time that I've taken an
online class, I think one of the things

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,430
I quickly find myself doing is wanting
to share my experience with people.

19
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,910
So whether I'm taking the class in
isolation, which is usually the case.

20
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,750
When I'm done with whatever the lesson
is that day, or the content that I've

21
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,340
consumed, very quickly I want to
talk with other people about it.

22
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,460
So for me,
I've always been able, luckily,

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,180
to facilitate that with actual
in-person conversations.

24
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,470
But I think for others, it's useful
to have a place to discuss topics.

25
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,130
>> So is that a perspective you try and

26
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,040
incorporate when you're
designing courses?

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,929
>> Is there a way we can
>> Absolutely.

28
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:16,360
>> facilitate that?
>> Absolutely.

29
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,220
I think any and every opportunity that
we have and that students want to take

30
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,030
advantage of that is discussion-based,
it's always beneficial.

31
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,210
I mean, that really, I think,

32
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:30,870
helps capture what is difficult
sometimes in the online education space,

33
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,050
is that you don't have the same physical
classroom that's traditionally always

34
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,010
been there, where people are having
these types of conversations.

35
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,660
>> It's true that there's an absence
of that physical interaction,

36
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,210
that face-to-face interaction
that we have right here.

37
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,090
But, in your experience, is there any
instance where not only can the online

38
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,390
environment be as good as it might be
in person, but can it ever be better?

39
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,550
>> I think so.

40
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,960
I think what the online environment
has allowed me to do personally, and

41
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,580
I think maybe some others as well,

42
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,450
is that it allows me to put my head down
and just go straight into a topic and

43
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,010
not have to weed through, say,
the conversation sometimes.

44
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,199
So it's kind of
a mix-and-match approach.

45
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,710
And, yeah,

46
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:13,600
when I want to learn a certain topic,
I can go and find it freely.

47
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,626
And I think that's something that
is better inherently about it.

48
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:19,210
>> Yeah.
I think that one of my favorite

49
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,870
experiences with isolation in an online
classroom and the comparison to

50
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,800
an on-campus class is that on campus,
if I know there's a student question

51
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,765
coming up, or I know students
are confused about something, and it's,

52
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:31,940
you know, Friday night, and I just
finished a lecture on Friday afternoon,

53
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,350
and I'm aware that
students are confused,

54
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,890
I have to wait until Monday to get back
to them and talk to them about that.

55
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,780
But what we have online is
what I call 24/7 classroom.

56
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,190
It's always there.

57
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,615
Students are always
available to interact,

58
00:02:42,615 --> 00:02:43,800
since they're always
checking their email.

59
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,270
They can always visit forums.

60
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,520
They always have a way that they
can interact with one another.

61
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,600
As I mentioned this before in these
interviews, but I can have an experience

62
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,990
where I'll log into our class forum and
in five minutes I can interact with ten

63
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,500
different students and then come
back an hour later and do it again.

64
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,030
And that's something we
can't really do in person.

65
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,490
In person, we have this time box thing
and we have limited resources to meet in

66
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,662
person because we have different
classes and things like that.

67
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:07,700
So there's a lot of things that we
can do online that actually can

68
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,140
break that isolation.

69
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,670
But to your point, it's not something
that just happens automatically.

70
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,680
>> Right.
>> It's something, yeah.

71
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,960
>> And it's interesting.

72
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,470
It's kind of like a dichotic state.

73
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,590
I think students have moments in their
learning where they really want to be

74
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,380
in conversation,

75
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,250
and then they have moments in their
learning where they really don't.

76
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,450
And I think a lot of times as
you're taking online courses,

77
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,870
a lot of that responsibility is
being placed on you as the learner.

78
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,060
And I think for us as course designers,
if we can take some of that

79
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,300
responsibility away and facilitate the
times when you want to learn with your

80
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,960
head down to the grindstone or
when you want to have class discussion.

81
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,569
>> Yeah, that need's really nice, too,
because I sometimes comment on what I

82
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:45,310
call a rule of 20s, which is if anything
is effective for 20% of the students in

83
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,720
a class, we should use it,
because 20% is a decent enough portion.

84
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,020
But we're never going to
have anything reach 100%.

85
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,006
And that's really nice here, because it
means that those 20% who are, or more,

86
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:58,310
who are going to get a lot out of
class discussions can do them.

87
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,950
But those who really don't
get a lot out of them don't

88
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,790
have to sit in the classroom
listening to them.

89
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,350
>> Right.
And,

90
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,930
I mean, I think a lot of students
experience this at an early age, for

91
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,580
instance, in traditional classrooms
where the conversation is something

92
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,550
you already know.

93
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,310
A lot of people enter a grade
school at very different levels.

94
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,970
And so if you don't skip a grade or you
don't get into the accelerated program,

95
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,209
you get bored, and
that's not good for students.

96
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:19,940
>> That's a waste of time.

97
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,730
And I think that students learn over
time that if I'm not consistently

98
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,600
being challenged, that school is boring.

99
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,510
And that's definitely not
what we want them to learn,

100
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,250
because eventually
school won't be boring.

101
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,880
Eventually, you know, they'll get to
the level that they're ready for.

102
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,390
But we don't want them to have learned
that they can skate through until then.

103
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,460
>> Right.
>> So

104
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,230
come tell a little bit
about your experience,

105
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,400
if you don't mind, also as a pay remote
employee, someone working at a distance.

106
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,650
Is there a similarity between being
a remote student and a remote employee?

107
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,600
>> I think there are similarities in the
fact that I feel like I need discussion

108
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,850
as a remote employee, whether that's
facilitated through online chat or

109
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,038
if I can just talk to a friend.

110
00:04:58,038 --> 00:04:59,980
So, you know,
where I work from in Alabama,

111
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,550
I try to do my best to create
a space that is kind of the office

112
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,460
that's very separate
from what is the home.

113
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,690
And then I've also tried to force
myself during the day to go out and

114
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,780
have conversations with people,
even if it's just over lunch,

115
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,140
because if I don't do that,
I feel like I've been in a cave all day.

116
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,150
And it drives motivation down.

117
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,770
The same kind of motivation maybe it is
for learning, I feel like it drives my

118
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,690
motivation down for producing good
material and doing good work.

119
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,220
>> I think nowadays we also are,
have the benefit of a lot of really nice

120
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,930
tools around these programs
that we have, our class forums.

121
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,450
I know that the OMSCS
program uses HipChat.

122
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,710
We at EDSC use Slack.

123
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,457
And there are some really nice
tools that can kind of try and

124
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:43,009
to recreate that environment of being
in an office or being in a classroom.

125
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,622
That I always have people at my
fingertips that I can talk to or

126
00:05:45,622 --> 00:05:48,594
I can always post a message right
now while I'm thinking about it that

127
00:05:48,594 --> 00:05:51,052
people will see when they have time,
as opposed to, oh,

128
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:54,200
I need to remember to bring that up on
Monday when I get back to class, so.

129
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,942
>> Yeah, it's one of those,
it's like that strange,

130
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:57,800
or it's strange,
it's like the old saying, you know,

131
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,832
you don't know how much you
miss something until it's gone.

132
00:05:59,832 --> 00:06:02,872
And when you're in the office every day
around tons of people and maybe you have

133
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:06,141
too many meetings, you're like, gosh, I
wish I didn't have to meet all the time,

134
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:09,090
whereas when I'm remote, I feel like I
look forward to the meetings because

135
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,200
that's my opportunity to actually get
to talk to somebody during the day.

136
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,840
>> Yeah.
Absolutely.

137
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,390
So do you have any final thoughts for
our students who might be trying to

138
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,410
solve the problem of student isolation
when they're designing their tools?

139
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:24,520
>> I think it's just to be conscientious
of the things we just talked about, and

140
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,188
to recognize that, you know,
maybe when your motivation is down and

141
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,874
you feel isolated, to go out and
seek and speak with other students.

142
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:33,369
You never know what
you're going to learn.

143
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:38,155
And I think there's a lot of
reciprocity between what happens

144
00:06:38,155 --> 00:06:40,790
in student conversations a lot.

145
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,496
I mean, you're going to get
something out of it and

146
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:45,350
somebody that you're speaking with
is going to get something out of it.

147
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,502
>> Okay.
Makes a lot of sense to me.

148
00:06:46,502 --> 00:06:47,292
Great.

149
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:48,600
Thank you so much for
talking to us today.
