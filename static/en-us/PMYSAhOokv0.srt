1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
We have a number of statements here, and for each of those statements,

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,460
I would like you to tell me two things.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,270
The first one is if the statement is correct and the second one is if the upper bound I'm giving you

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,780
on the right side here is the best possible bound or the tightest bound that you can find.

5
00:00:19,780 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check all of the boxes that you think are correct.
