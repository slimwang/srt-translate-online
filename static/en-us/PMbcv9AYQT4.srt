1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,790
Now completeness can be difficult to assess. As my

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,720
friend David Silverman is fond of saying, you don't know

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,840
what you don't know. Now in this discussion we're

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,360
not talking about individual fields missing from a record. Instead,

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,720
we're actually talking about missing records. That is to

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,570
say, trying to figure out when it's an entire record

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,400
that's gone missing. So the solution here is very similar

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,080
to the solution for accuracy. Essentially, we need reference data.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,750
So, let me give you an example from something

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,560
I work with on a regular basis. I'm the director

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,320
of education at MongoDB. And part of my role, I'm

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,280
responsible for our certification program. Now, we do things a

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,490
little bit differently than some other technology companies, in that

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,290
our certification exams are delivered entirely online. So, in addition

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,800
to a completed exam record for every test taker. In

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,160
delivering our exams online, we have to have a way

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,730
of proctoring them to ensure the security of the

18
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,600
exam. The way we do that is through a web

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,990
proctoring solution where capture video of the test taker

20
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:04,140
session. We capture both video of the test taker themselves,

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,660
using a web cam, as well as screen capture

22
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,590
for everything that's going on on the test taker's computer

23
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,260
screen as they're taking our exam. What this means,

24
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,430
then, is that we have three separate data stores that

25
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,400
need to agree with one another on a couple of

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,154
different things. And here is where we get to the completeness

27
00:01:21,154 --> 00:01:24,990
example. They must agree on the list of test takers, that

28
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,400
is to say, if there is a record for a test

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,510
taker in any one of these databases, there must be a

30
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,790
record for that same test taker in the other two. They

31
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,250
also need to agree on the duration of the exam session.

32
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,680
So the video, here and here, should be approximately the same

33
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,070
length and it should agree with the elapsed time that

34
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,730
we recorded for a test taker. And, of course, these

35
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,990
have to agree approximately. Within sum Epsilon. Now, you're probably

36
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,630
thinking what if somebody took an exam and the record doesn't

37
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,080
exist in any one of these three databases. Well, that's

38
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,640
exactly right. As I mentioned at the beginning of this, this

39
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,340
is a difficult problem to address because we don't know

40
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,710
what we don't know. In that case using the solution that

41
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,690
we just described we would not detect the missing exam

42
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,070
record. So, in point of fact, we actually do a couple

43
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,680
of things in addition to this to ensure completeness for our

44
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,070
exam records. And those are essentially preventative measures to make sure

45
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,050
that we can't get into a situation where we haven't captured

46
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,930
the appropriate exam data for a given test taker. So, to

47
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,520
wrap this up, as with much of data cleaning, the means

48
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,710
of auditing completion is situation specific. It really depends on what

49
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,590
the data is that you are auditing and what reference sources you have access to.
