00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:04,520
Abstraction implies thinking at different levels. For

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,300
example, there is the level of solving our hunger problem,

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,950
where we think about food items and where we can obtain them.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,640
An entirely separate level has to do with our physical body movements,

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,140
such as insert the key into the ignition or packing the grocery bag.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,700
For abstraction to help us solve a design problem, a key property must hold.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,610
The work done at a lower level of abstraction must contribute to the solution at

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,920
the higher level. It doesn't help us to solve our hunger problem if all we

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,730
pack into the grocery bag are paper towels and people magazine.
