1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,979
So today I want to talk a little bit

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,380
more about probability distributions.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,000
And specifically talk about what's called

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,790
continuous distributions, because there's

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,530
some caveat that you should be aware of

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,250
as you go forward in this class. So

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,970
here is a new prop, it's a nerf gun, they

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,730
actually should like this, and we have

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,820
a lot of those of Udacity. I want to

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,310
know, to do an experiment in which shoot a

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,650
projectile and somewhere hits the ground,

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,750
say between this location over here, and

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,279
this location over here, I just don't know.

14
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,309
So I call this A and B. The question I want

15
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,170
to raise is a tricky one,

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,840
consider any location X assume that the

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,910
angle of the new kind of somewhat random

18
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,700
and source the pressure behind the

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,260
projectile, what's the probability that

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,469
any specific XD might choose is the

21
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,829
correct one.
