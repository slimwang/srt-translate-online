00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay guys, I'm going to walk you through the solution to Homework 1,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which is basically just getting Google App Engine online.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The first thing I do is I got to Chrome.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's see, we're going to download--

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we can go to Google--the Google App Engine page.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm going to assume you've signed up to App Engine.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And then we basically go to the getting started for--

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm using Python 2.7.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Some of you may have more success with 5.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm going to use this Hello, World example.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And we're going to create these two files.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
One is called helloworld.py,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and the other will be called app.yml.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So let's start with the first one. We'll copy this.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'll go to my editor, paste this.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We're going to make this say Udacity, if I recall--Udacity.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's go ahead and save this.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So I've saved this file.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm going to make the other file.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We can just take the contents from the getting started document here--

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
app.yml--we'll put this in a new file,

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and we'll go ahead and save this.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay, all is well.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We'll go to my terminal, and we'll go to that directory.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I called it Unit 1 Homework; it's where I save these two files.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You see, there they are.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And then to run it locally, it always says we run div_appserver.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is the console way of running Google App Engine code.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Many of you are probably using a GUI.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I prefer to use the console version.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It makes it a little bit easier. You don't have to add projects and that sort of stuff.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to run it on a different port.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's what the P command is for,

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
because I share this machine with other instructors

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and somebody is already using the default 8080.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And then we just run it in the current directory. That's what period does.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Okay, so this starts up.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It complains a little bit about some missing APIs.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We're not using the image API, so it doesn't matter.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And then we go to our browser,

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and we can go to local host 8888,

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and there we see it.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hello, Udacity.

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So all is moving.

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We can play around with things a little bit.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If I wanted to change the text here,

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I can change it, save it, go to Chrome, reload, more exclamation marks--pretty cool.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Now, when I want to put this online,

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
all I do is instead of using div_appserver,

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
what I use instead is update app cfg update,

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and I can run it in my current directory, and this will upload the app.

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm not actually going to run this for you because

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
this would override my other homeworks that are already online

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
that are--you guys can use for demos.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But basically all I do is I hit Enter here,

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and it chatters at me for a little while, and then we're done.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The homework was intended to be very simple,

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
but I realize that actually getting App Engine running on different platforms can be troublesome,

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and getting the Python versions in synch can be troublesome.

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I hope you guys have worked through all those things.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And that's it for Homework 1.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
All I wanted to do was get this basic website online.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There it is in my local machine.

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And if I were to go to where I've already got it uploaded--

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I think I can go to udacitycs253appspot.com,

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
where I've uploaded it prevoiusly,

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and there it is--Hello, Udacity.

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So all is well. Good job, if you got that.
