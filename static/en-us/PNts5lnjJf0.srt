1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,790
At this point in the course
you've learned about a few

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,020
different techniques for
handling images on the web.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,070
For instance,
you can use external files and

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,250
just link to them in your html or
you can inline images and

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,335
put all the data you need for
an image right there on your page.

6
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:21,880
You can use Raster images like this
picture of the star called Electra.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,400
Or you can use Vector images like this
star from the Material Design icon set.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,320
And then of course you can issue images
altogether and use font icons like font

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,160
awesome and then use CSS techniques for
styling them.

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,490
Funny thing is that any and

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,950
all of these techniques can lead to
pretty much the same result on the page.

12
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,010
The so called, right strategy.

13
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,850
Notice the air quotes there,
for including an image,

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,390
almost completely depends on the images
place in your app, as a whole.

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,320
For the next few quizzes, I want you to
think through some of the scenarios, and

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,510
decide the best course of action.

17
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,710
Here's the first scenario.

18
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,030
You're developing a mobile app that
displays an ever changing catalog

19
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,910
of bikes for sale.

20
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,690
You need an image for
this start right here,

21
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,892
to indicate which bikes have just gone
on sale within the last 24 hours.

22
00:01:11,892 --> 00:01:14,980
You want to scale the star
image with the rest of the app,

23
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,190
in order to fit mobile phones and
tablets proportionally.

24
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,910
So should you use a vector graphic or
a raster graphic and

25
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,260
should you inline the icon or should
you set its source to external file.

26
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,910
Think it through and pick the best
answer for both the questions.
