00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,630
Hey, I'm here with Larry, and

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:04,019
he's been having a problem with
a webpage he's been working on.

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,810
I think this is a great opportunity to
both help Larry out with his problem and

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,230
to show you what version
control can be useful for.

5
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,700
>> Yeah, so,
I've been working on a website, and

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,540
it looks a lot different
than it did before.

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,610
There used to be a banner at the top.

8
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,110
And like the design looked
a lot better before.

9
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,670
>> Hm, so, what did it look like before?

10
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,070
>> I have an old version
saved on this tab.

11
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,660
>> Oh, yeah, I see.

12
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,530
It looks like you
changed the description.

13
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,470
>> Yeah, I filled it in.

14
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,320
>> Cool.
Did you change anything else?

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,810
>> I think I might have,
but I'm not sure.

16
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,638
>> Do you still have the HTML for
this version?

17
00:00:31,638 --> 00:00:32,460
>> Yeah, I do.

18
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,820
>> Cool, so you could compare
the two and see what changed.

19
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,020
>> Okay, let's try it.

20
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,700
>> Now I want you to find the
differences between the two versions of

21
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,310
this HTML.

22
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,490
Go ahead and
find the lines that have changed,

23
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,570
then enter the line numbers in this box,
separated by commas.
