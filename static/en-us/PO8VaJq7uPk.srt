00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,343
I have compiled in this little chart over here, some of the equations for which

2
00:00:04,355 --> 00:00:08,599
we've already said that we could calculate the slope or rather just read the

3
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:12,992
slope off of the equation by looking at the coefficient of the x term. And I've

4
00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:17,186
also included two equations in which we said that, that was something we could

5
00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:21,876
do. My question is, what is unique about these questions on the left that allows

6
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:26,524
us to just read the slope off of their x term coefficient? Can we do this

7
00:00:26,536 --> 00:00:31,485
because of the form of the equation because there are two or fewer terms on the

8
00:00:31,497 --> 00:00:36,637
right side of each of these equations? Because there's nothing added to y on the

9
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:39,216
left side? Or because they have a y and an x?
