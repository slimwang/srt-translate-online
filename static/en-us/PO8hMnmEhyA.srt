1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,400
CSS in this style.CSS file.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,420
You wont be learning CSS in this class, but

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,080
if you want to learn more, check out the link in the instructors notes.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,470
CSS is pretty simple.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,240
As we can see over here, it simply defining the styles of the page.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,200
>> So what about this .jQuery file that you wanted to tell them about?

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,550
>> Yeah. jQuery.

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,600
It's a powerful and

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,580
popular JavaScript library that we'll be using in this class.

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,200
At a very high level, it lets us inspect and manipulate the elements in a page.

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,620
You won't be learning the ins and outs of jQuery in this class.

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,950
But, you'll get an idea of what you can do

13
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,630
with some very basic jQuery functions.

14
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,100
For more information about JQuery, check out the link in the instructor's notes.

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,060
>> The things we're doing with JQuery are fairly simple and

16
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,450
can be done Vanilla JavaScript as well,

17
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,570
just like we're doing in the script tag at the bottom of the HTML page.

18
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,770
But we wanted you to gain experience with using third-party libraries.

19
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,360
When appropriate, we will also list the Vanilla JavaScript ways to

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,150
do things in the instructor's notes.
