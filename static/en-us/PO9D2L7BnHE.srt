We know the new area c squared, is equal to the old area, a squared plus b

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:08,688
squared. This of course Pythagoras' theorem, but the reason why it worked in

3
00:00:08,688 --> 00:00:13,733
that proof was because the areas of the 4 triangles did not change. In other

4
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:17,273
words the light blue area that we had for a squared plus b squared, was the

5
00:00:17,273 --> 00:00:23,385
same after we rotated the triangle. After we rotate the 4 orange triangles the

6
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:28,650
light blue square is still the same area. It's just need recombined to form c

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,370
squared the new area.
