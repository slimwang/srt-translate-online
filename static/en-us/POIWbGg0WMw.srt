1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,100
As you can see here, QRDA statistics

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,930
can be reported at one of three
levels of detail called categories.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,620
These are all reported in
a CDA-compliant XML format.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,680
As you can see here, the categories
are the individual patient level,

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,190
which could be a list of encounter dates
for that patient, patient lists, which

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,270
could be all the diabetic patients in a
provider's practice, or aggregated data,

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,500
which could be the average hemoglobin
A1c for all the diabetics in a practice.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,880
We'll discuss QRDA and
other related standards,

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,420
such as the format for
the queries themselves, in Lesson 9.

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,960
For now it's just a standard vehicle for
reporting the results of population or

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,290
public health queries.
