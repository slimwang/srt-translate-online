00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,380
Before we move on from this example, let's calculate a confidence interval for

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,972
the mean population difference. This is exactly the same as what you've learned

3
00:00:08,972 --> 00:00:13,677
before except this time we use the mean difference. I won't go through it step

4
00:00:13,677 --> 00:00:16,929
by step this time. Try and figure it out on your own.
