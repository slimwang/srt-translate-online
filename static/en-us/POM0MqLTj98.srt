1
00:00:01,189 --> 00:00:04,560
Every resume should have a header
that displays their name fully

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,679
to help the employer recognize
your resume from someone elses.

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,922
It should contain the appropriate
contact information and

4
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:12,929
link to your other online profiles,

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,859
in case the employer wants
to find out more about you.

6
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:19,298
Then the rest of your resume is about
providing evidence that you are job

7
00:00:19,298 --> 00:00:19,710
ready.

8
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:25,619
You want to include the education and
work experiences you have.

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,336
If you feel like one of these
sections will not be very strong,

10
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:30,557
emphasize others.

11
00:00:30,557 --> 00:00:35,000
When I was applying to my first job,
I had no prior work experience.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,289
I wrote a lot about my volunteer and
student club roles to show

13
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:40,759
I could work in a team,
meet deadlines, and multitask.

14
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:43,969
I also had a very large
education section.

15
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:46,140
Where I even listed
an award I got I was 13,

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,210
because I didn't have much else to show.

17
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,362
By now I've held a few jobs so
I've removed all of my volunteer roles.

18
00:00:53,362 --> 00:00:58,369
And my education is the smallest and
least important section on my resume.

19
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:03,318
Good news, by completing program you
won't have to desperately fill out your

20
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:05,620
resume like I did years ago.

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,340
By completing your core projects you
will have relevant experience to share.

22
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:14,340
The first thing an employer reads on a
resume has to be the most relevant work

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,829
a job candidate has.

24
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:19,530
Prior jobs should be listed first if
they're related to your new career.

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,290
If previous jobs aren't related, or

26
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,220
if you've never held a job, you can
list your projects or education first.

27
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:30,230
Depending on what provides the most
evidence that you're job-ready.

28
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,350
You should also include a skill
section that is a short list

29
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:36,549
summarizing all the skills you've
developed in jobs, in projects, and

30
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:39,739
learning, that are relevant
to the job you're pursuing.

31
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:42,429
These skills should be as
technical as possible such as

32
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,920
being able to speak Spanish or Mandarin,
or software programming skills.

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,290
You shouldn't include skills that
employers assume someone already has or

34
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,609
can learn easily,
such as using Microsoft Word.

35
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,129
There are certain skills
sometimes called soft skills

36
00:01:57,129 --> 00:02:00,129
that are more effective when
they're shown in examples.

37
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:03,729
Don't list communication or
teamwork, for example, as skills.

38
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,570
Instead, demonstrate that
you're a great communicator and

39
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:10,448
team player in the bullet points of
your project and experience sections.

40
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:11,300
Let's dive into that next.
