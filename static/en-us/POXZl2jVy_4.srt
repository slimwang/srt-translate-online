1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,467
Now we expand Fagaras, and
we get a path that reaches the goal and

2
00:00:05,467 --> 00:00:08,201
it has a path length of 450 and

3
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:13,083
an estimated distance of 0 for
a total f value of 450.

4
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:16,123
And now the question is,
what do we do next?

5
00:00:16,123 --> 00:00:19,260
Click here if you think we're
at the end of the algorithm and

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,902
we don't need to expand next.

7
00:00:20,902 --> 00:00:23,740
Or click on the node that you
think we will expand next.
