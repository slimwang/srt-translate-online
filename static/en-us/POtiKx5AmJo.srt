>> Now, in order to update the cx and cy offsets for trimmed sprites, we have to

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,039
do a couple of interesting things. First off, you need to understand that

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,924
[unknown] will only do a smart trim from the edges to the center. So, for

4
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:15,706
instance, if you end up in a situation where you got a nice box and pixels in

5
00:00:15,706 --> 00:00:19,550
the top left quadrant, it won't actually trim that sprite because it can't

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,369
shrink it to the center. Because of this, we don't actually need any of the

7
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,385
information from the frame in order to create the new cx and cy values. Instead,

8
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:31,225
all we have to do is figure out the half dimensions for the sprite and create an

9
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:35,159
inverse of that, which represents our offset. Now, we store the cx and cy here,

10
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,999
which means if the sprite is or is not trimmed, it doesn't really matter in the

11
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:41,482
drawing function that uses these values later.
