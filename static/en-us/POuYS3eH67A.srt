1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,630
So imagine at a point, you compute one of these scale and variant functions like

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,380
average intensity, over a range of neighborhood sizes, okay?

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,730
So, we're, we're at a single point and

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,770
we're computing this function f over different region sizes.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,510
And you'll notice that, well it goes down, and then it goes up, and

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,500
then it goes down again.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,440
So that's my function that I computed over different region sizes, all right?

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,890
Now, let's suppose in my next picture I shrink the thing down by half.

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,130
Well now, as I compute that same function over the same region sizes,

10
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,840
two, four, eight, 16, right?

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,940
It's going to take the same shape, but it's going to get there faster.

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,630
Which is why this function is essentially just a squashed version of

13
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,800
the one on the left.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,370
But it's the same function, just squashed.

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,450
Ha.

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,132
Well, what that means is, suppose we pick the maximum of that function.

17
00:00:58,132 --> 00:01:02,010
I'm going to call that S1 in the, in image 1 on the left.

18
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,770
And I take the same function and I'm at some other point.

19
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,340
I'm same, same function on the point of the second image.

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,990
If I were to take the maximum there, it would be a different size, right?

21
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,140
Because that image had been squished in half.

22
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,780
That would be S2.

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:22,530
But these two neighborhood sizes would be covering the same

24
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,030
region of the image between the two pictures.

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,980
So they would be matching scales.

26
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,620
So, the important thing is, I do each one of these things independently.

27
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,680
That is, I do this thing and at this particular point,

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,350
I find my maximum function my, my maximum of the function.

29
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,540
I say that's the natural scale size that I'm going to use.

30
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,650
Then I come over here and I go to my other image.

31
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,040
And I do over here, and

32
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,110
I'm at some interest point, remember we found our interest points.

33
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,200
And I look over all these different region sizes, and I say, aha!

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,510
This is the scale there, and I compute that function, and

35
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:02,110
magically, these two scales correspond.

36
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,490
These are the same chunk of image.

37
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,310
Here's a very nice illustration of that.

38
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,056
Here's a picture of probably some beautiful church on the inside here,

39
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:11,816
it says white and

40
00:02:11,816 --> 00:02:15,760
gray, in some church, in some mountainous area in Europe I'm going to guess.

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,760
And you'll notice that there's a function here that we're computing,

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,120
that's a function of scale and here it is, and this is the maximum point.

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,060
And this circle is meant to reflect the scale size of that maximum.

44
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,490
Here we have that same image zoomed way out, computing at this interest point,

45
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,650
so we've got the same interest point.

46
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,800
So, notice that this interest point is just sitting at the top of

47
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,430
this little chimney thing here.

48
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,530
We compute the function again, and

49
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,370
again, we take the maximum, and that's going to be this circle.

50
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,580
And the really cool thing, is that this circle, and this circle,

51
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,570
are the same components of the image.

52
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,330
Those are the two scales to operate at.

53
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,070
If we want to find descriptors that match, that's coming later.

54
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:09,720
Basically, the scale of my detectors in one image should be big and

55
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,700
in the other image should be small.

56
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,300
Also the scale of my my descriptors and my detectors.
