00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,950
In the spreadsheet, one thing you can do is write equals stdev, and that's the

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,859
spreadsheet's function for finding the sample standard deviation. And then

3
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:18,605
you'll put your cell numbers here. So in the case of Gettysburg you would have

4
00:00:18,605 --> 00:00:23,940
a2: a19. But it's also really good to practice doing it step by step, rather

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,495
than just using one function to figure it out instantly. If you round to the

6
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:34,922
100th place again, we would get the sample standard deviation for Gettysburg is

7
00:00:34,922 --> 00:00:38,400
2.65 and 2.18 for Wilma.
