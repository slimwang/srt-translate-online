00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You know a magic formula we can compute the Â± term of the confidence level.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And here's how it looks like, where we've replaced the analytic variance

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
by the empirical variance over here, but otherwise, it's the same as before.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I just calculated this, and here's what I get.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For this sample, that means, we would say between the probability 0 and 1,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
we believe most likely the coin was biased and has a 0.754 probability.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We are quite sure we have a confidence interval that's 0.42 wide on both sides.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In fact, it reaches beyond 1, which is a funny side effect of this in the normal assumption.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This is the interval in which we are uncertain about what the correct value of the coin is.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In fact, this one does include 0.5--it could be that this coin is perfectly unbiased.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
0.75-0.42 is much smaller than 0.5. Obviously, it's a small sample.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's do the same thing for a larger sample, and this one is a quiz for you.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Here's the sample. I've ordered it. There's three tails and seven heads.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I want you to just compute for me the mean plus/minus this confidence interval with the term.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please give me both numbers.
