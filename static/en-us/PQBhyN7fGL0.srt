1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,141
The graph has increased vertically 2 units. So, we'll call the rise 2. Slope is

2
00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:10,039
always rise divided by run, so the slope of this graph is just 2 divided by 1,

3
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:13,562
or just 2. Excellent work if you figured that one out.
