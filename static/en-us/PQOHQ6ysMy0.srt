Just like Firebase Realtime Database,
Firebase Storage provides a set of

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,429
security rules, so that you can
authorize access to storage.

3
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:11,140
Let's consider an example.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,050
Friendlychat storage contains photos,
and these photos were meant

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,240
to only be sent to other Friendlychat
users and not the whole world.

6
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:22,559
What might happen if anyone
could see all of your photos,

7
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,349
maybe even change them?

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,650
What if you wanted to share a video
of your top secret prep technique for

9
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:32,269
your award winning recipe for peach
cobbler, and you wanted to only share it

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,980
with your family, but
instead the whole world got to see it?

11
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:39,500
Users expect that you
will protect their data.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,380
Firebase Storage security gives you
the tools to keep their data safe,

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,890
as well as limit what kind
of data can be stored.

14
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,920
By now,
you know why data security matters, so

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,350
let's take a look at how
Firebase Storage rules work
