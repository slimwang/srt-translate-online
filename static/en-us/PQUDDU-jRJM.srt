00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,640
Awesome work.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,650
You've added the core platforming
mechanic to Gigagal and

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,890
worked out some sophisticated
game logic to do so.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,720
I hope you're already starting to get
some fun ideas for level designs.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,410
Right now though,

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,790
you only have one screen's worth
of platforms to work with.

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,250
In the next level, let's fix that,

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,220
by allowing the camera to
follow Gigagal around.

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:20,720
See you there.
