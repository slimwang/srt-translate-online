00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,333
It took Grant a while to process the
orders that he had gotten from the school,

2
00:00:04,427 --> 00:00:07,830
and from Mr. Belvedere, but in the end, he
finally had a moment to relax. He had

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,298
visions of little children running around
with glasses, wipers, and nozzles, and of

4
00:00:12,298 --> 00:00:17,436
course, of his new friend. What a nice old
man. He felt so excited and so satisfied

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,794
that, pretty soon, his products would be
keeping the glasses of people all over the

6
00:00:21,806 --> 00:00:26,708
world nice and clean, but he realized he'd
left out one major detail. He hadn't yet

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,209
set the price for his wipers or for his
nozzles. In terms of the equation that we

8
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:35,269
came up with for his total future
earnings, he hadn't picked a value for w

9
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:39,931
yet, or one for n. Remember that w is equal
the price per wiper blade set and n is

10
00:00:39,943 --> 00:00:44,958
just equal to the price per nozzle. Grant
thought long and hard about how much he

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,006
wanted to charge for each wiper blade set
and for each nozzle. But finally, he came

12
00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:55,452
to a decision, he set the price per wiper
blade set at $30 and he set the price per

13
00:00:55,452 --> 00:01:01,295
nozzle at $12. Now, these might look like
kind of steep prices, but, hey, Grant had

14
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:04,943
worked really hard on both of his products
and they're actually pretty intricate

15
00:01:04,955 --> 00:01:08,656
designs. Takes a lot of work to make
nozzles and wipers this small that aren't

16
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:10,441
just going to break their first use.
