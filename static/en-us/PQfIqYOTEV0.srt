1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,150
To illustrate the power of the cache, as well

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,080
as the importance of high hit rates. We'll do

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,280
a few calculations in the form of a question.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,670
Suppose that retrieving data costs 4 cycles on a cache

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,890
hit, but 100 cycles on a cache miss. Then

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,980
how many cycles does it process with a 99% hit

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,970
rate, spend on average? And then we want to

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,497
compare that to one with only a 90% hit rate.
