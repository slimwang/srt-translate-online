1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,010
I think the, the most important thing that, that inspired me to start to

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,415
shoot Keep In Mind is that they they should have a very curious mind.

3
00:00:09,415 --> 00:00:09,770
>> Mm-hm.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,760
>> They should have the ability to ask questions, to kind of formulate these

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,773
questions as it pertains to them, as, as they would see these questions being

6
00:00:18,773 --> 00:00:23,270
raised in their own lives. So if, if there's a problem they see with

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,100
the, with the, with the pieces that they are working with or with again

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,780
with the project that they're working with, they should, they

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,409
should try to they should try to ask these questions in

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,890
terms of and how they can understand for themselves. And

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,780
once they understand, once they know what is the, the, the

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,250
gist of the question is, then they can go and

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,280
use algorithms. Obviously it helps tremendously if you know, if you

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,300
have experience about all the arguments that are out there

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,560
to attack these questions. But I think the most important ability

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,170
that, that you should have as a data scientist, and you,

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,300
you could obviously improve throughout your, your career in this is

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,980
that you have this this inquisitive mindset, where, where you are

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,680
trying to ask the right questions while you are trying to, to

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,920
see what is important. And you also have an overview of

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,080
what kind of data can support in the end, your conclusions

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,470
that you are going to draw draw with the help of

23
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,150
these algorithms that you are going to use to solve these problems.
