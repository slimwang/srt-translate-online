00:00:00,405 --> 00:00:03,750
Bugs that don't crash your program can
be a lot trickier than the ones that do.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,190
When the function calculates
an incorrect value, finding out where it

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,005
went wrong often involves splitting
the function up into smaller pieces and

4
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:14,330
looking at what the values or
variables are in each of these pieces.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,190
One basic way to do this is to
introduce print statements that help

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,230
put the variables where
you can see them.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,270
So here's a piece of code that removes
the substring from a longer string.

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,240
For instance, if we call remove on
audacity and a, we get udacity.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,660
The way this works is it finds
the location of the substring

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,520
in a longer string and
the length of the substring.

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,300
And it uses those to extract the part
of the longer string before and

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,240
after the location of the substring.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,720
And it glues them together
part_before and part_after and

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,960
it returns the result.

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,020
So this can remove a substring
from the beginning or the end or

16
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,120
in the middle of a longer string,
like so.

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,020
But sometimes it does
pretty weird things,

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,490
like remove do from ding and get dining.

19
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,630
Is this function just doomed?

20
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,790
Try finding out where it's going wrong.

21
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,020
Looking at the values of some of these
variables in the middle here might

22
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,500
be a good strategy.

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,520
Try adding some print statements
to look at these variables and

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,430
see what you can find.
