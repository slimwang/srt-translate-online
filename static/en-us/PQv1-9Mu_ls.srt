00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,050
In this question, we're going to ask you to make

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,580
a persona. Now, doing this can be one of

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,370
the most difficult and intimidating thing that a designer

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,260
has to do, but it's really useful. So to try

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,760
and keep this very first persona as sort of

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,200
simple and straightforward as possible, we're going to ask that you

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,190
make it for yourself. And hopefully these two words

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,460
are throwing up a huge warning for you. Because it

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,470
almost, sounds like we're asking you to go down

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,790
the path of designing for yourself, but we're not. Normally,

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,730
you do not want to design yourself, and you won't

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,910
be doing that here. So why are we asking you

13
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,190
to do this? For one thing, we hope this

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,290
is an easy introduction to creating a persona, because it

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,150
really can be quite difficult. For another, what we want

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,770
to do is seed the discussion form, with a bunch

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,790
of authentic personas and use cases. In, in the next question you'll take the

18
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:01,080
personas and use cases created by classmates for themselves, and

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,470
build feature lists and flows for them. We've create a template in

20
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,300
Prezzy, and there's a link to it below that might help you out.
