1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,670
So I told you before that nobody actually uses average intensity.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:05,580
All right?

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,570
So what will we use?

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,880
Well, let's think a little bit about what it means to be a good function for

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,000
scale detection, all right?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,080
Basically what you want is you'll be able to find these maxima as a function of

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,640
the region size.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,780
Okay, so it would be bad if for

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,350
large variation of region side basically the function stayed flat.

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,040
That would be bad.

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,330
Another thing would be something that wiggled too much.

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,385
It's only three wiggles here.

13
00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:34,940
Imagine, there were a lot of wiggles because we'd like to find the maximum and

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,530
we'd like to find really just you know,

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,390
one or a really key maximum that we can pull out.

16
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,630
So you know this becomes your ideal functions and it's sort of a, a,

17
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,410
a cartoon of the function there.

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,080
So, the functions that people use.

19
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,890
What you want is one that, you know, responds nicely to contrast.

20
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,640
Right? Because the idea is, you know, you're going to have edges at some scale.

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,140
Oh yeah, remember that?

22
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,800
Right, so edges occur at some scale.

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,370
And if you were operating at the right scale you'd get this nice sharp contrast.

24
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,880
And if you were, as you got away from that a little bit, it would fall, and

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,350
if you got too far, it would fall down on the other side.

26
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,830
So there's going to be something having to do with contrast, or

27
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,970
finding points of high contrast.

28
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,190
What are points of high contrast?

29
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,670
Remember edges?

30
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay?

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,550
So in fact, some of the detector operators that people use are just applying,

32
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,410
remember kernels?

33
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,910
And these are the kernels like when we apply differential operator kernels.

34
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,650
We just apply a kernel to the image and use the output.

35
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,300
Now one that people sometimes use and we actually talked about this.

36
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,410
This Laplacian of Gaussian.

37
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,520
When we talked about edge detection we said well,

38
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,720
in the first derivative, there is two directions you could do.

39
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,090
You could do an x and a y.

40
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,820
And then we said, well if you have to worry about the second derivative there's

41
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,370
all sorts of challenges.

42
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,220
But we mentioned something called the Laplacian of Gaussian.

43
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,710
The Mexican hat operator, right?

44
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,310
And this was this one and the equation is written here.

45
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,410
I actually pulled out my own MATLAB here and

46
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:09,410
made a little 3D plot of what it looks like, and here this shows you.

47
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,960
It's an operator which essentially is a second derivative operator, and

48
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,470
we talked about zero crossings.

49
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,271
Go back and, and, review the property of what we did on edge detection and

50
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:21,360
you'll see it there.

51
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,110
So that's the type of operator that you could use.

52
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,630
Now, something that we didn't really talk about.

53
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,810
Instead of doing this whole Laplacian of Gaussian which involves these sort of

54
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,010
annoying second derivatives, there's a cute little trick you can do.

55
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,100
And that's called a Difference of Gaussians.

56
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,560
And that's what's written here, is basically if you take out of one Gaussian,

57
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,500
and you subtract from it another Gaussian with a slightly different,

58
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,340
or some factor different sigma, you get a curve.

59
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,420
And what's plotted here in the red is the difference of Gaussian, and

60
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,820
in the blue is the actual Laplacian.

61
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,470
And you see that the values are almost the same.

62
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,110
So if we're doing the work here,

63
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,710
it's a lot easier since you're completing these Gaussians anyway.

64
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,930
So just subtract things.

65
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,045
One of the things also is that these Gaussian the the difference of

66
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:12,490
Gaussians to solpacean is circularly symmetric.

67
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,760
So it's totally invariant with respect to orientation.

68
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,580
Okay so as you rotate your image, nothing changes.

69
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,000
And it says that it's invariant to scale.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,500
What that means is if I, it's just like it's a scale and variant function

71
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,220
before, if I blow up the function and then I make my operator that much bigger.

72
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,740
I'll get back the same value that I had before.
