00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,557
To find the first x intercept, I take my equation and I set y equal to 0. I know

2
00:00:04,557 --> 00:00:09,061
any number times 0 is 0 so I have negative 2x equals 8. Dividing both sides by

3
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:13,675
negative 2, I get both sides equal to negative 4. So, our x intercept occurs at

4
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:18,646
x equals negative 4 and the point is negative 4, comma 0. For the Y intercept, I

5
00:00:18,646 --> 00:00:23,642
set x equal to 0. Negative 2 times 0 is 0 and I'm left with 4Y is equal to 8. We

6
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:28,639
divide both sides by 4 to get y is equal to 2. So, our y intercept occurs at y

7
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:33,459
equals 2, but the point is 0, 2. For the second equation, we can find the x

8
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:38,554
intercept in the same way. We set y equal to 0. So this term drops out. And I

9
00:00:38,554 --> 00:00:43,746
get 3x is equal to 6, then we divide both sides by 3, and x equals 2, so our x

10
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:49,394
intercept occurs at x equal 2 and we have the point 2 comma 0. This y intercept

11
00:00:49,394 --> 00:00:54,938
is a little bit harder, we do the same process for y intercepts we set x equals

12
00:00:54,938 --> 00:01:00,032
0, so x is 0, so am left with 9y equal to 6. We want to solve for y, so we need

13
00:01:00,032 --> 00:01:04,578
to divide by 9. So I have y is equal to 6 9ths. If we remember back from

14
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:09,529
fractions, we know that a 3 goes into both the numerator and the denominator, so

15
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:14,324
I can simplify this fraction. 6 divided by 3 makes 2, and 9 divided by 3 makes

16
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:19,008
3, so I'm left with 2 3rds. 0 comma 2 3rds is our y-intercept here. For this

17
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:23,922
last equation, we can find the x intercept again by setting y equal to 0, then

18
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:28,759
solve for x and divide both sides by 4. 0 divided by 4 makes both sides 0. So,

19
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:33,838
our x intercept occurs at point 0,0. To find the Y intercept, you let x equal 0,

20
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:38,334
so I get y is equal to 0. Whoa. This is the same point and their both the origin

21
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:42,440
so something is going on with this line. We'll learn about this equation in the

22
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,470
upcoming lessons but if you're interested try graphing this and see if you can

23
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,959
figure out what's going on.
