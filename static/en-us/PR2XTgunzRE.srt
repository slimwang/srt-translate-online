Choosing the right data types for your variables can

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,820
make or break your programs. We've prepared a fact

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,760
sheet on numbers for you that tells you what

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,650
number can be represented in each type. Check out the

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,344
link below and then write variable declarations for each of these variables by

6
00:00:13,344 --> 00:00:18,660
matching them with a type and a literal. Write an appropriate type: int, long,

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,459
or double in these boxes. And an appropriate literal: 123,

8
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:30,750
1.23E2, 123L, or 123., in each of these boxes. There

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,610
may be more than one right answer for some of these.
