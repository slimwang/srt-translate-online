00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,441
Lets trace the code to find the answer. If the price is 95, then the

2
00:00:03,441 --> 00:00:07,657
originalPrice is less than 100, so it'll skip the first part of the if and go

3
00:00:07,657 --> 00:00:12,286
into the else. The discountedPrice will be the originalPrice, 95 minus 10. If

4
00:00:12,286 --> 00:00:18,264
the original price is 100, 100 is still not greater than 100, so we still go

5
00:00:18,264 --> 00:00:26,508
into the else. And get original price minus 10. If the original price was 105

6
00:00:26,508 --> 00:00:33,052
though, 105 is greater than 100. So we day, discounted price is the original

7
00:00:33,052 --> 00:00:38,243
price minus 20. And we get 85.
