1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,340
For the first one, no.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,420
Remember, micro-optimizations
really aren't that helpful.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,200
For the second one, not quite.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,240
While it may seem like a good
idea to execute JavaScript

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,578
on a 16 millisecond schedule,
this doesn't necessarily guarantee that

6
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:17,370
JavaScript is always executing at
the right time for each frame.

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,780
The third one isn't right either.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,750
You need to make sure that JavaScript
is done as early as possible,

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,920
because it can lead to style
calculations, layout, and paint.

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,440
In fact, this answer doesn't
even really make sense,

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,270
because the frame is done
when the pixels are painted.

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,610
So, the last answer is correct.

13
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,718
The beginning of every frame is
definitely the best time to run

14
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:38,850
JavaScript because remember,
it can create style, layout, paint and

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,278
compositing changes.

16
00:00:40,278 --> 00:00:43,640
And finishing JavaScript early means you
have as much time as possible to take

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,000
care of everything else.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,450
In the next video, you will learn about
request animation frame which is an API

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,430
that will schedule your JavaScript to
run at the right point of every frame.
