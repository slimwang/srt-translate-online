1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,260
In order for strings to be localized,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,680
it helps to move all
strings into strings.xml.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,390
Any string that is hard
coded cannot be translated

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,936
without modifying the compiled code.

5
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:13,800
In the strings.xml file, you

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,220
will want to comment thoroughly in order
to provide the context for the string.

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,390
This will result in higher
quality translations.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,040
You may want to include information
such as, what is this string for,

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,600
when is it presented to the user,
where is this in the layout?

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,680
For example, translations are less
flexible for a button than a text box.

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,820
You can also specify strings that
should not be translated simply with

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,310
a placeholder tag.

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,470
Finally, there are a variety of system
provided formats for dates, times,

14
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,700
numbers, and currencies.

15
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,480
So take advantage of our
utils such as date format for

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,740
dates, decimal format and string
format for numbers and currency, and

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,790
phone number utils for phone numbers to
simplify formatting across your locals.
