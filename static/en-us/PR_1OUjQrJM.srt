00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,370
Now, if the image of complexity classes that are just true look a bit complicated to you,

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,090
I would have to say you haven't seen anything yet,

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,370
because, of course, they are many many more complexity classes out there.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,050
Basically, any type of machine and restriction that you can think of forms a complexity class.

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,290
And a nice collection of this, if you're interested in that, is the complexity zoo

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,890
initiated by Scott Aaronson, a theoretical computer scientist at the MIT,

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,190
and here we have a nice formatting of this document as a PDF, but it is also a website.

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,270
So Google the complexity zoo. It's really interesting to see.

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,090
And as you can see here in the glossary, there are many many many more complexity classes

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,050
than ones that we talked about.

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,140
So let's just see if we can find those that we already know.

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:50,020
Here's FPT. This is the class of fixed-parameter tractable problems. Here is P.

13
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,130
Down here somewhere is NP, but you see it's already difficult to find

14
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,010
even those classes that we know, because they are so many different other ones.

15
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,300
And they have lots of different origins, so there are some classes that are related to approximation,

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,940
some classes that are related to randomization, and many classes here are also

17
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,920
related to special models of computation that we haven't had the time to cover in this course.

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,120
So there are some models of computation that work with circuits for example

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,970
or even more exotic models such as quantum computing.

20
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,260
The bad news about all of these classes here or all of the classes here in this document is that

21
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,150
we don't really know much about the relationships between them.

22
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:31,050
We know some, but as you have seen with P versus NP, there are lots of open questions here,

23
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,190
which I think is also a good news for you.

24
00:01:33,190 --> 99:59:59,999
There are still lots and lots and lots of things to explore in computational complexity.
