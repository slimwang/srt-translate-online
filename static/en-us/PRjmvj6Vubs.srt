1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,650
In all these data cases, I kind of make them up to make my point here, but

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,260
they could look like this.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,970
For the new coordinate system, there's an x and

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,461
y, and again, maybe we truncate to the nearest 0.5.

5
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:16,660
And then the x prime axis has delta x and delta y,

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,850
and so does the y prime axis of the new coordinate system.

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,110
I'm filling in some values to resolve ambiguities.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,080
Let's give it a try first with x and y.

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,790
What's the new center here?

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,860
Give me those two numbers.
