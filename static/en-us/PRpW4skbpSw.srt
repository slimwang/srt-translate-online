00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,310
Use case diagrams will have two major icons. One are some stick figures and

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,100
these denote external actors. Typically, these are system users, but they

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,110
may also stand for other systems or external devices. In the use case diagram,

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:21,984
ovals are use cases. That is, this is, a use case diagram is not a system story.

5
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:27,300
It's a description of the set of system stories. Lines in the diagram

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,890
without annotations indicate participation. That means that the actor at one end

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,814
is involved in the use case oval at the other end. There're two

8
00:00:37,814 --> 00:00:42,530
annotations available in use case diagrams. One is the extends annotation and

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,056
the other is the uses annotation. Extends mean that you have one story and

10
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:53,968
you'd like to extend it by some other contingencies, essentially getting two for

11
00:00:53,968 --> 00:00:59,890
the price of one. The uses stereotype is like a subroutine or, or function call.

12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:05,209
That is, a common piece of behavior that might used by several other use cases.
