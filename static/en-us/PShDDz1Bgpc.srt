1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,580
All right,
let's look at this first pair.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:08,266
In this case, cd../otter means go up
to the parent directory of the current

3
00:00:08,266 --> 00:00:11,880
working directory and
then go to the otter folder.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,310
So that means we go up a directory and
then to the otter folder.

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,020
So here we're actually just cding
to the directory we're already in.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,820
The second cd command is cd /home/otter
which is just the absolute path.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,980
So these two commands are equivalent.

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,665
Onto the next pair.

9
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:34,324
cd ./www, dot means the current
working directory and www means we're

10
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:40,080
going to look for a folder or a file
called www in the current directory.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,370
So this one right here.

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,180
This next command, cd www just looks for

13
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,100
the file inside the current working
directory which is the same thing.

14
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,580
So this pair also matches.

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,989
Let's look at this pair, cd ../www.

16
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:01,190
This will look in the working
directory's parent directory for

17
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,597
a folder called www.

18
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:05,140
That's not even in the file tree though.

19
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,178
Compared to the second command,

20
00:01:07,178 --> 00:01:10,537
cd ./www which is the equivalent
to what we just saw.

21
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,470
So these commands do not match.

22
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,339
This last pair of commands
are equivalent though.

23
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:19,793
Cd ../../usr goes to the grandparent

24
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:23,442
directory of the current
working directory.

25
00:01:23,442 --> 00:01:25,822
And then heads down to /usr,

26
00:01:25,822 --> 00:01:30,510
which is equivalent to using
this absolute path cd /usr.

27
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,220
In this case,
the relative path isn't any shorter or

28
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,330
more convenient than the absolute path,
but they're still equivalent.

29
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,180
So we'll check it off.
