The answer is Veronica. Susan has a PhD, I have a Master's Degree, she's

2
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:11,140
awesome at recess, but still, it's the baby who has the most neurons. I know,

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,675
it's crazy. I couldn't believe it when I first learned this either, but we have

4
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:19,606
more neurons at age two than we have at any other time in our lives. But

5
00:00:19,606 --> 00:00:22,420
neurons only function when they're sending coordinated signals between other

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,060
neurons. So, as we develop and learn more, and get more control over our

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,380
bodies, neurons become more and more solidly connected. Remember from the brain

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,997
lesson? Again, this goes with the if you don't use it, you lose it. Neurons

9
00:00:36,997 --> 00:00:39,230
that are not used are in fact lost.
