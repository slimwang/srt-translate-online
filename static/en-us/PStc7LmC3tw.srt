1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,336
Awsome, so you have identified all the SQL

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,730
satements we need for the App, And once again,

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,350
there are first, creating, we need to insert a new pet into the database,

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:14,190
and we also need to insert dummy pet data into the database.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,900
Next for the reading actions,

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,730
we'll need to read a list of
all the pets in the shelter.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,706
As well as read a single
pet's detail by its id.

8
00:00:23,706 --> 00:00:25,859
[BLANK_AUDIO]

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,330
As with update actions,

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,050
we'll need to update a single
pet's details by its id number.

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:37,720
And lastly for delete, we'll need to
delete a single pet using its id,

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,870
as well as delete all
the pets in the database.

13
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,831
Now in addition to these actions,

14
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:47,390
you will need to learn how to setup a
database and the tables within your app.

15
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,730
But luckily you've already
learned how to do this.

16
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,800
So as you learn about the statements,
I'll be highlighting them and

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,230
adding them to an SQLs cheat sheet which
you'll get at the end of this lesson.

18
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,780
Now you'll learn a few other
fact in the course, but

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,989
understand that the SQL code to do
these commands are the most important.

20
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:07,120
Now, let's dive in and
learn how to select and

21
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,730
insert pets into the database, as well
as view all the pets in the database.

22
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,570
So let's take a look.

23
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,470
So the first command we'll be
learning is the SELECT command.

24
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:21,890
And remember this is synonymous
with reading from the database.

25
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:26,350
Notice that we can specify
parameters such as which column and

26
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,310
which table we'll want to select from.

27
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,120
And here's an example of
that statement at work.

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,470
So we've updated the general
version of the selection statement,

29
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,670
to indicate which columns and
which table we want to select from.

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,820
So this command specifically
selects all the rows and

31
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,450
all the columns within
the pets database table.

32
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,090
Now let's break this apart and
see what it means.

33
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,680
So SELECT is what we're trying to do.

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,090
And this asterisk here,
sometimes called a wild card,

35
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,529
is a special short cut here
meaning all rows and all columns.

36
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,700
Next we have FROM which designates
what table we are going after.

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,430
And in this case, we want to
take a look at the pets table.

38
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,580
Remember, in more complicated scenarios
there could be multiple tables

39
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,080
within a database.

40
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,970
Just as there could be more
complicated spreadsheets,

41
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,130
when there are often multiple pages of a
spreadsheet within a larger spreadsheet.

42
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,680
So this command is analogous to
selecting a list of all the pets

43
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,220
in the shelter.

44
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,160
And I'll be adding that

45
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,780
to our cheat sheet that you'll
find later in the lesson.

46
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,740
So here I am in the Command Prompt
in sqlite3 program, and

47
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,700
I'm inside the shelter database.

48
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,000
And I have one table on that database,
the pets table.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,670
So let's try using that SELECT
command that we just learned, and

50
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,340
select all columns from our pets table.

51
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,500
And with a semicolon and hit Enter.

52
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,460
And as expected, well there's
nothing in our pets table just yet.

53
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,640
So let's go ahead and add a pet.

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,940
So we can think of adding a pet like
adding a road to a spreadsheet.

55
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,150
And here's our new arrival, Tommy.

56
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,260
As you can see in this spreadsheet,
Tommy is a he, and

57
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,960
he weighs 4 kilograms, and
his breed is a Pomeranian.

58
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,782
So the command we need to put him as
a row in an SQLite database is this

59
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:10,466
right here.

60
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:11,967
[BLANK_AUDIO]

61
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:13,970
So INSERT.

62
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,540
An inserting says that
we need to add a row

63
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,869
into the name of the table that we want.

64
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,000
So following that,

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,260
and the parentheses here are the columns
that we want to add data to.

66
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,250
And afterwards,
we have the keyword VALUES,

67
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,680
followed by the corresponding values
we want to insert into those columns.

68
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,780
So specifically, for our Tommy example,
we write it something like this.

69
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,410
So here I'm inserting into
the pets table, and for the column

70
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,365
id I'm inserting 1, and this is because
by default id's usually start by one.

71
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:50,410
And I'm inserting his name, Tommy,
breed Pomeranian, gender 1,

72
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,160
which corresponds to male,
and weight of 4 kilograms.

73
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,900
So now with this command,
we've added Tommy into our database.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,870
Now here's an exercise to help you
practice using the SQL insert command

75
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,010
within the table.

76
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,720
In this scenario, Nina just
brought a cat named Garfield, and

77
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,550
entered his pet information below.

78
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,970
What I like you to do is to write
the code in your database to correctly

79
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,885
insert Garfield with
all of his information.

80
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:19,630
Two, go ahead and
change the mode to .ascii,

81
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,320
and then paste that result from
selecting all the pets and

82
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,030
all the columns from the database,
into this text box here.

83
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,200
And so this is given that Tommy from the
previous video has already been added

84
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,764
in the row id 1.
