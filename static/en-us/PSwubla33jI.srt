00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
Xcode is a very powerful integrated

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,740
development environment. And it may feel

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,109
a bit overwhelming at first, but that's

4
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:09,330
completely ok. Let me show you one of the

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,400
features of the interface builder part

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,800
of Xcode that will make your life a bit easier.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,690
Here on the left side of the

8
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,279
interface builder is what's called the

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,400
document outline. Here I’m looking at a

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,260
completed version of Pitch Perfect just

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,630
so that you can see a full scope of what

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,660
the document outline can do. Your version

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,250
of the Pitch Perfect app won't have any

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,189
of these UI elements just yet. I’ll use

15
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,690
this bar to drag out a little bit more

16
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,590
space. And in the document outline, we can

17
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,890
see a View Controller called the Record

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,590
Sounds View Controller. And if I click

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,809
the disclosure triangle, we can see its

20
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,300
corresponding view and UI elements like

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,840
buttons and labels. Clicking any of the

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,879
disclosure icons will show you what's

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,370
contained within. If you're looking for

24
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,680
an easy way to find and work with UI

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,539
elements, the document outline is the

26
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,699
place to go. Here I’ve selected the

27
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,309
record button or I could select this

28
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,680
recording label and so forth.

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,840
Working with the document outline will

30
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,850
become extremely beneficial once your

31
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,650
app starts to have more than just a few

32
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,670
buttons and labels.
