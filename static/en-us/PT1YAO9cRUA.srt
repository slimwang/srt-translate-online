1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,434
And the answer is 1. Since the 2n's of a polynomial function with an odd

2
00:00:04,434 --> 00:00:09,514
degree, like this cubic one right here, need to point in opposite directions.

3
00:00:09,514 --> 00:00:13,540
Either one pointing to negative infinity, and the other to positive infinity,

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:19,353
or vice versa. The curve has to pass through the x-axis at least once.
