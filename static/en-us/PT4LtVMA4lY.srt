00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,410
To make the audio play slowly, I accessed Help and searched for AVAudioPlayer.

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,360
Now I read through this and came across a property called Rate.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,970
Now this variable or property is really interesting.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,720
Because it says that its default value of 1.0 provides a normal playback rate.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,381
All right?

6
00:00:18,381 --> 00:00:21,825
And that the available range for this, is from 0.5 or

7
00:00:21,825 --> 00:00:26,590
half speed playback, through 2.0 for double-speed playback.

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,340
All of this is really promising.

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,000
It goes on to say that you must first enable something called,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,170
the Enable Rate Property.

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,770
So I can go back to my code, and set the Enable Rate Property to be true.

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,390
And then in my action, I can set the rate to let's say 0.5 for now.

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,283
Okay, let me run this project again.

14
00:00:47,283 --> 00:00:50,293
I'm going to go to the second scene one more time, and

15
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:52,193
then let's click this button.

16
00:00:52,193 --> 00:01:01,799
>> My mama always said, life was like a box of chocolates.

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,090
>> Nice.

18
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:09,825
Now just for kicks, I wonder what would happen if I changed this rate to 1.5.

19
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:11,188
Let me try that.

20
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:15,102
All right going to the second scene again.

21
00:01:15,102 --> 00:01:19,310
>> My mama always said, life was like a box of chocolates.

22
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,920
>> So it seems like rate is working well.

23
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,000
For now, I'm going to go back and

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,980
change the rate back to 0.5 and oh, by the way,

25
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,400
it's a good practice to stop the audio player before we begin to play it.
