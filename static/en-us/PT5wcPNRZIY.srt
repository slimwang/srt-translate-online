Great work if you got 4x squared z. We can see that 2 times 2, times x times x

2
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:09,284
times z, would be our leftover factors, so that makes 4x squared z. You might

3
00:00:09,284 --> 00:00:13,989
have also thought about it in your head. If you divide 36 by 9, you'll get 4.

4
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:18,482
And if you divide x to the 4th, by x squared, you'll get x squared. If you

5
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:23,852
divide y squared by y squared, you would be left with 1. And then you have one z

6
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:26,293
remaining, so 4x squared z.
