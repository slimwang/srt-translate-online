1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,110
All right, so we're going to play
around a little bit with this idea of

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,970
contraction mappings, but
in a very simplified setting.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,270
We're going to look at,
instead of Q functions,

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,550
we're going to look at just scalars,
just real numbers X.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:16,125
So B is some operator that is applied
to a number and it spits out a number.

6
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:16,940
>> Mm-hm.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,870
>> And I've defined 4
different kind of Bs here.

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,790
And some of them are contraction
mappings and some of them are not.

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,460
And we have to figure out by using
the definition of contraction mapping

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,640
which are which.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,500
>> Okay.

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,890
So let me just make
certain that I have this.

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,360
So the way you defined
contraction mapping before,

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,960
you said there would be
these two functions.

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,630
And you basically want to see if they
get closer and closer to one another.

16
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,400
>> Yep.
>> As you apply the operator.

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,130
But here the function is just a thing,

18
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,610
instead of being a Q value with all
these indices, it's just a number.

19
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,785
>> Yeah, you can think of it at
being a single state, single action,

20
00:00:48,785 --> 00:00:49,290
[LAUGH] right.

21
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,250
It's like an MDP that has one state and
one action.

22
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,200
So it's just a number.

23
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,280
>> Okay.
So it's just a number.

24
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,780
All right, and so I just want to see
if there's some gamma that I can choose

25
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,440
between 0 and 1, inclusive of 0, not
inclusive of 1, that as I apply these

26
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:08,570
operators X/2 X+1 X-1 and (X+100) *
.9 that will just get smaller and

27
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,330
smaller and smaller and smaller and
closer and closer closer together.

28
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,140
Okay I think I got it.

29
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,660
>> Okay.

30
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,120
>> All right let's do the quiz, go.
