00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,900
One topic we didn't talk
about in the last lesson.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,860
Was where exactly NSUserDefault exists?

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,090
Where is it being saved?

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,630
Where is anything being saved for
that matter?

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,510
To answer this, you have to take
a look at our devices file system.

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,640
In this lesson,
we'll talk about the iOS file system and

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,740
the concept of the sandbox.

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,120
We'll then look at the basics of where
and how to access these files with code.
