The third foundational concept to review is orthogonality. Which is the extent

00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,440
to which the features of a system can be varied independently. You would like to

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,060
enhance the orthogonality of your system in order to make more options available

00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,810
to its users. Orthogonality also clarifies system descriptions and

00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:22,450
documentation, and supports automatic generation of system components.

00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,470
The principle of orthogonality was developed by David McGovern and
