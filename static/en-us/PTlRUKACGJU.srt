1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:06,060
So RAID stands for
Redundant Array of Independent Disks.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,980
And effectively with RAID
we have several disks

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,120
that play the role of only one disk,
in different ways.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,810
It can either pretend
to be a larger disk or

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,730
they can pretend to be
a more reliable disk.

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,470
Or they can pretend to be
the disks that is both larger and

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,480
reliable then any one of the disks.

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,600
Now it's important to note,
before we go into explaining RAID,

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,800
that each of the disks is still
detecting errors using codes.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,260
So each of the disks,
will know whether it has an error, and

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,000
in the overall RAID skim, we will know
which of the disks have an error.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,020
So, we don't have to have
RAID figure that out.

13
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,330
We know that because each
of the disks still has

14
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:52,150
a code at each sector that is capable
of both fixing some errors and

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,950
also detecting even more
errors on that sector.

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:01,400
So, what we want from RAID
is better performance and

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,590
we want normal read
write accomplishment,

18
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:08,020
basically service accomplishment as far
as disk is concerned, even when there

19
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:13,230
are things such as bad sectors on
some disks or an entire disk fails,

20
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,160
for example because it can no longer
spin, and things of that nature.

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,290
So things that a basic error
detection correction code

22
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,460
that is attached to each sector,
cannot fix anymore.

23
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,540
Possibly because we can no longer
get to that sector on the disc.

24
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,630
Not all of the array techniques
will improve both of these.

25
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,710
Some improve only performance,
some improve only reliability,

26
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,310
some improve both.

27
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,530
And these array techniques our number.

28
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,290
So there is RAID 0, RAID1, etc.

29
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,180
And we will look at some
of these techniques.
