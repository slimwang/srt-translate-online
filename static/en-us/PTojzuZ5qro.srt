00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,210
Now that we have seen a 2 bit predictor and how it works,

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,700
let's do a quiz on 2 bit predictors. Let's say, you have a 2 bit predictor,

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,650
that has the four states. The 00 state is the strong not taken.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,620
Then we have the weak not taken, weak taken and the strong taken state.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,630
Let's say that we start in the strong, not taken state. And remember,

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,550
that if we have a taken decision, we move towards the strong taken state and

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:29,770
stay there as long as we have a taken decision. But for a not taken decision, we

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:35,240
count down towards the strong not taken state. And stay there. The question for

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,930
you is, is there a sequence of branch outcomes that results in never predicting

10
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,770
correctly. So is there a sequence such that when we start in this state, and

11
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,500
here obviously we're predicting not taken, so the outcome needs to be taken. And

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,670
then after we update the predictor, we have to mis-predict again and

13
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,050
again. If yes, there is a sequence, then write the.

14
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,430
First five outcomes of that sequence here. If no, then put a check mark here.
