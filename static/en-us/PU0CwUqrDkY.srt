00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,400
I'm sitting here with Jacques one of
our lead front end web developers.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,900
Hi.
>> Hi.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,900
>> So

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,130
I was talking with Nick about
architecting a little bit.

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,462
You know, like you've got some code
it's not necessarily up to snuff and

6
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:16,863
you know you just move things around a
little bit to get it up to snuff right?

7
00:00:16,863 --> 00:00:21,740
So what if I were to give you a piece
of code that's like that but worse.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,430
>> You could sort of still tease
parts of it, you know, around and,

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,420
and sort of get into the modules or the
separations that you're interested in

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,850
and then replace those pieces as,
as you work on them.

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,640
So, if the, if the code's not
stuff that you want to keep around

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,220
separating it out means you get to
burn little pieces of it at a time and

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,190
replace them and upgrade them and
make them, make them better.

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,680
>> That makes sense.

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,540
So what if I give you some code
that's even worse than that?

16
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,510
Like, lets just say,
big mess of spaghetti code.

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,160
>> If you can't tease it apart, or

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,220
if there aren't good ideas that you'd
like to keep just burn it to the ground.

19
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,060
>> Just start.

20
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,130
>> Just take it all away and
rebuild that functionality.

21
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,620
>> Just like that.

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,150
Wow!

23
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:08,650
Okay.

24
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:14,051
So I guess you're giving me permission
to burn horrible spaghetti code to

25
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:14,810
the ground?

26
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,440
>> Absolutely.

27
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,990
You will thank yourself in the future.

28
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,105
What if it's worse than that?

29
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:23,348
[LAUGH]
>> Nuke it from space.

30
00:01:23,348 --> 00:01:24,310
>> [LAUGH]
>> Have,

31
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,875
have a friend delete it for you.

32
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,420
>> [LAUGH] Don't even,
don't even look at it.

33
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,260
>> No, no.
>> Just, okay, so, wonderful.

34
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,580
Now you have permission
to delete horrible,

35
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,450
awful spaghetti code from your projects.

36
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,450
Huh, so you,
you actually have done this?

37
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,090
>> Yeah, oh, absolutely.
>> Have,

38
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,719
have you ever nuked
something from space?

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,650
Between Nick and I, we,
we have done that absolutely like,

40
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:50,024
hey could you get rid of all of that,
I'll, I'll replace it.

41
00:01:50,024 --> 00:01:50,785
>> Oh, boy.

42
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:53,830
[LAUGH] Fantastic or horrifying.

43
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,880
>> Or, or terrible, yeah.

44
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,410
>> Terrible.

45
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,250
>> kind of both.

46
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:56,870
>> Awesome.

47
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,660
Well, thanks for sitting with me and
talking about this.

48
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,160
>> Absolutely.
