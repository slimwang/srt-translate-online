00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,075
>> If we look back at our original equation, 6x minus 5 over 7 minus 3x equals 4

2
00:00:05,075 --> 00:00:10,470
minus 8x over 4x plus 2, what does each side individually simplify to if we plug

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,619
in the value of x that we just calculated? So substitute in 19 over 30 in each

4
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:20,539
spot of x for the left-hand side first and then enter the answer that, that

5
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:23,584
equals here, and then the right-hand side.
