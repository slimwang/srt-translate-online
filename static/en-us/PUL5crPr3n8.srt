1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,260
So, here's one way to answer this question. We have

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,680
our two variable definitions. We can print out the distance

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,280
light travels in one cycle by dividing speed of light

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,680
by cycles per second using the variables, and when we

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,460
run that we see the result is 0.11. So, that's

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,490
0.11 meters, or 11 centimeters. Another way to solve this

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,600
that might be better would be to introduce another variable.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,490
So, instead of just printing the result, we can store

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,590
it in a variable. We'll call it cycle_distance. Now, when

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,910
we run it, there's no result. We haven't printed that

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,180
out yet. But we've stored it in a variable. And

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,000
now, we can print out the result of cycle_distance. Which gives

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,810
us the 11, 0.11 meters. If we want the result

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,160
in centimeters, well since we've already stored the result in meters

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,990
in a variable, we can compute that by just multiplying

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,780
that by 100. And now we get the result in centimeters.
