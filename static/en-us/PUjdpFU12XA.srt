00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,065
We can also add attributes to our GrizzlyBear. And people often wonder how do

2
00:00:03,065 --> 00:00:06,325
you tell the difference between a BlackBear and a GrizzlyBear? There's actually

3
00:00:06,325 --> 00:00:09,778
an easy way, and the difference is based on their behavior. If a BlackBear is

4
00:00:09,778 --> 00:00:13,808
chasing you, and you climb up a tree, the BlackBear climbs up the tree after you

5
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:17,603
and then, it eats you. If the bear that's chasing you is a GrizzlyBear, the

6
00:00:17,603 --> 00:00:21,503
GrizzlyBear knocks down the tree and then, it eats you. Now, I should warn you,

7
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:24,923
don't take advice on bears from someone who's sitting in a dark room with

8
00:00:24,923 --> 00:00:29,308
fluorescent lights on his hands. So, this means our GrizzlyBear does not have a

9
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:34,089
climb_tree attribute, but does have a knock<u>down</u>tree and also has a chase. And

10
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:38,184
I should mention when I'm writing the methods here, I'm not including the self

11
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:42,186
parameter. There's always a self parameter so just to save space, I'm not

12
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:46,084
including it here. So, here's the code for our GrizzlyBear, which looks a lot

13
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:47,519
like the code for our BlackBear.
