00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,330
Markov models are also trees, but

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:09,630
introduce recursion where steps can be
repeated and time is now represented.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,120
However there is typically no memory, so

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,520
that each step is based entirely
on the current state of things.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,530
Here's a diabetes example
where the patient risks and

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,870
outcomes evolve over time.

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,470
Note that unlike decision trees
there are many paths to the model.

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,130
And it is possible to
go back as shown here

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,189
to a prior point depending on
actions and probabilities.
