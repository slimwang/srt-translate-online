1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,350
So let's do this with a simple example here.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,820
I have two different images.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,180
There are oh, basically two smaller images like this.

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,236
And if you notice, of course, there's a lot of similarity.

5
00:00:10,236 --> 00:00:14,450
We want to now find, within these two images, find the overlapping regions that

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,400
would allow us to generate a smoother, novel image.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,140
If I put these images next to each other with a little bit of an overlap,

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,180
I get a sharp boundary, a vertical boundary.

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,360
Of course, I want to get rid of this vertical boundary.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,850
So, let's start looking at the regions.

11
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,900
So this is the overlapping region, between the two images.

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,960
I take the two source images and look at the same overlapping region.

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,500
This is the overlapping region between them that if I tried to do a simple cut,

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,190
that's what it looks like.

15
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,830
Let's look at these two overlapping regions.

16
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,514
If I was to take these two overlapping regions, and

17
00:00:43,514 --> 00:00:47,582
my interest is to do basically looking at the difference between these.

18
00:00:47,582 --> 00:00:52,080
What we can do is look at the, the squared difference between them.

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,540
So I take the difference and square it.

20
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,370
So take all of the pixel values from this region,

21
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:00,220
they're the same size small images, and compute a difference between them.

22
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,800
This would give me a, an image like this.

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,040
And within this, if I find the minimum values in this direction

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,400
the horizontal direction, I will get a region like this.

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,450
These are where the differences are the lowest.

26
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,455
So this basically kind of says,

27
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:21,660
is now I can take this, and generate a region like this.

28
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,450
And if this was the cut I put in through this overlapping region,

29
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,350
I would get as smooth as possible image like this.

30
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,700
Now if you notice, these two images, you can't see the seam.

31
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,160
So in essence, what we did is we took these two overlapping patches,

32
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,910
create a difference, squared it.

33
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,440
That started giving me a value of where things are.

34
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,210
With in this, I found the minimum error boundary.

35
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,960
Use that minimum error boundary to get enough pixels on the left and

36
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,289
the right, and the overlapping region, and generate a new image.

37
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,380
Okay? A new novel image that has the actual pixels but,

38
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,700
more importantly, now you cannot see the seam.
