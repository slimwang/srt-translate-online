1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:07,270
So in my view, this type of problem is
best solved by a parametric learner,

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,790
and this sort of problem is best
solved by a non-parametric learner.

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,370
And here's why.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,270
For this problem,
you can start with an equation,

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,440
you can look it up on the net or
whatever.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,920
That will express an estimate of how far
a cannon ball will go given this angle.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,800
What's missing are some
parameters of that equation

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,590
that reflect the velocity of
the cannon ball coming out and so on.

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,690
But just by taking certain measurements
of how far the ball goes at different

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,420
angles, you can use a parametric
learner to find those parameters.

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,980
The key thing here is that you
can start with an estimate

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,600
of the underlying behavior of the system
in terms of a mathematical equation that

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,660
expresses how it behaves.

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,990
Now, in the cases of the honey bees,
we really don't know, we don't really

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,310
have a guess of what that underlying
mathematical equation might look like.

16
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,057
And if you don't have a guess,
it's better to use a non-parametric or

17
00:01:07,057 --> 00:01:11,530
instance-based model because
it can fit any sort of shape.

18
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,600
Another way to put that is
that this model is biased, in

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,600
the sense that we have an initial guess
of what the form of the equation is.

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,100
This solution is unbiased
because we don't know.

21
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,440
Now, we're raised to think biased
is a bad thing, but if you go into

22
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,020
the problem already knowing the form
of the solution, it makes sense to take

23
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,450
advantage of that bias, and
aim your solution toward that bias.

24
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,890
Let's reflect on the pros and
cons of each approach.

25
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,650
For a parametric approach, we don't
have to store the original data, so

26
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,650
it's very space efficient, but

27
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,900
we can't easily update the model
as more data is gathered.

28
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,730
Usually we have to do a complete rerun
of the learning algorithm to update

29
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,820
the model, thus for
parametric approaches,

30
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,400
training is slow but querying is fast.

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,882
For non-parametric approaches,
or instance-based,

32
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:13,420
we have to store all the data points.

33
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,960
So it's hard to apply when
we have a huge data set, but

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,890
new evidence can be added easily since
no perimeters need to be learned,

35
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,850
adding data points doesn't consume
additional time, thus training is fast,

36
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,510
but querying is potentially slow.

37
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,170
Most importantly, these nonparametric
approaches avoid having to assume

38
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,980
a certain type of model, whether
it's linear or quadratic or so on.

39
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,430
And therefore, they're suitable
to fit complex patterns where we

40
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,310
don't really know what
the underlying model is like.
