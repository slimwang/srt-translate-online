1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And the answer is 0.074. The first one would give us a probability of 1/3 · 2/3 · 1/3.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And the model that heads come is a probability of 1/3.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
These are the individual probabilities. You multiply them together.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And when you do this, you get 0.074, which is the same as 2/27.
