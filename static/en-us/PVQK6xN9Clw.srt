1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,950
The first one simplifies to negative 4 times the square root of 2, and the

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:09,390
second one simplifies to 27 times the cube root of 3. Nice work if you got both

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,289
of these correct. Simplifying roots isn't always the easiest, so let's see how

4
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:18,255
we can do it. We can split up the root of 8 into the root of 4 times 2. We can

5
00:00:18,255 --> 00:00:21,382
also split up the root of 50 into the root of 25 times 2, and the root of 200

6
00:00:21,382 --> 00:00:26,426
into the root of 100 times 2. This gives us perfect squares, which allows us to

7
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:30,445
take square roots in our next line. Now that we're here, we can take the square

8
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:33,635
root of 4, which equals 2, the square root of 25, which equals 5, and the

9
00:00:33,635 --> 00:00:39,176
square root of 100 which equals 10. We multiply the numbers in front of our

10
00:00:39,176 --> 00:00:44,902
radicals, to get 6 root 2, minus 30 root 2, plus 20 root 2. This leaves us with

11
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:49,410
6 minus 30 plus 20 times the square root of 2. When we subtract and add these

12
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,182
numbers together, we'll get negative 4 times the square root of 2, our final

13
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:56,434
answer. For our second problem we want to break up these two numbers into

14
00:00:56,434 --> 00:01:01,224
perfect cubes. I know 81 is the same thing as 9 times 9 which is the same thing

15
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:08,842
as 3 times 3, times 3, times 3. I rewrite 81 using 3 cubed times 3. We do this

16
00:01:08,842 --> 00:01:11,684
since we know if we have a factor that appears three times we can take it

17
00:01:11,684 --> 00:01:16,600
outside of the cubed root. So I used my product rule to split up this radical

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,258
into two pieces, and then we take the cube root of 3 cubed, which just equals

19
00:01:20,258 --> 00:01:25,473
3. For our second radical, we split it up into the cube root of 8, times the

20
00:01:25,473 --> 00:01:31,722
cube root of 3. Notice that I've rewritten 8 as 2 to the 3rd power. We do this

21
00:01:31,722 --> 00:01:36,356
so that we can take the cube root of 2 cubed, which gives us 2. We multiply 7

22
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:41,170
times 3, to get 21, and we multiply 3 times 2 to get 6. Now we have two

23
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,703
radicals that have a matching index and a matching radicand. So this means we

24
00:01:45,703 --> 00:01:50,483
can add them together. We'll have 27 times the cube root of three.
