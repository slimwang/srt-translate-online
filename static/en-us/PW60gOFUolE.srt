1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,480
So the first personality theory that we're going to discuss is Psychoanalytic

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,310
Theory, which was created by Sigmund Freud. And Freud made, at least, four

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,122
major assumptions in explaining personality. The first assumption he made was

4
00:00:13,122 --> 00:00:17,857
about the power of the unconscious. And that is, the unconscious mind is much

5
00:00:17,857 --> 00:00:22,747
more important in shaping our personality than the conscious mind. And, in

6
00:00:22,747 --> 00:00:28,012
fact, the metaphor that he used is of the iceberg. And, the tip of the iceberg

7
00:00:28,012 --> 00:00:32,395
is consciousness, just a small little part of who we are. What' really

8
00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:37,834
important is below the surface and that's the unconscious mind. So the second

9
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:42,546
major assumption that Sigmund Freud made was that the human mind has three

10
00:00:42,546 --> 00:00:48,900
provinces. So the first province of mind is what, Sigmund Freud, called the Id.

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:54,563
And that's the seat of our impulses, our desires, pleasure oriented. It's all

12
00:00:54,563 --> 00:01:00,088
about want. The second province of mind, was what he called the Ego. And the

13
00:01:00,088 --> 00:01:05,819
ego is our sense of self. And it's realistic and finally we have the super ego

14
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:11,474
and that is a sense of control of our impulses, conscience, knowing right from

15
00:01:11,474 --> 00:01:17,107
wrong. So what makes these three provinces so interesting is that there is a

16
00:01:17,107 --> 00:01:21,198
conflict. Inherent conflict between the Id on one hand and the Super ego on the

17
00:01:21,198 --> 00:01:27,486
other. Between the impulse wanting something and controlling that impulse, in

18
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:32,122
fact we often can depict this as a fight that we have ourselves between our

19
00:01:32,122 --> 00:01:38,879
angel side and our devil side. The devil tells us to do it, we want it, the

20
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,980
angel says no. So the third assumption that Sigmund Freud made is that

21
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,685
personality is shaped by early childhood experiences. Now this may not seem so

22
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:53,455
radical to us, but understand that in the day, people did not make that

23
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:58,940
assumption. They assumed childhood experiences didn't really matter much. Freud

24
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,067
argued otherwise. So the last major assumption that Freud made, one of his big

25
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:09,895
contributions, was the idea of defense mechanisms. And defence mechanism, are

26
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:14,626
like our immune system but for our mind. They keep threatening ideas, thoughts

27
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:18,885
and motives out of consciousness. So to the better known, defence mechanism

28
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:23,640
that Freud talked about were repression, and reaction formation. And in

29
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,642
repression, we're keeping these threatening ideas and thoughts and feelings out

30
00:02:27,642 --> 00:02:32,456
of consciousness. And the main thoughts and feelings and impulses that we

31
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:39,180
repress are sexual and aggressive impulses. So with reaction formation, we turn

32
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,754
a threatening impulse into it's exact opposite. So for instance, a parent who

33
00:02:44,754 --> 00:02:49,718
might harbor unconscious feelings of hostility towards a child. But those

34
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:52,570
feelings are too threatening so they turn it into it's opposite and become

35
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:58,364
smothering with affection. Likewise, another example might be homophobia. When

36
00:02:58,364 --> 00:03:02,979
someone is threatened by their own latent homosexual impulses and turns that

37
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:08,890
impulse into hostility towards those who express homosexual behavior.
