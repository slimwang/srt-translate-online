1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,570
So the directory is a distributed
structure across the cores.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,500
It's not centralized in one place,
like the bus.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,730
So not all requests have to go to
the same part of the directory.

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,830
Each slice of the directory
will serve a set of blocks,

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,290
where a slice of the directory is the
part of the directory that is next to

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,740
a particular core.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,740
And that means that different blocks

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,240
will be served by slices that
are in different places.

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,692
And that's how we achieve a higher
bandwidth because really each slice

10
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:37,310
could operate independently because
it serves a disjoint set of blocks.

11
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,880
What does a slice do?

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,890
It has one entry for
each block served by that slice.

13
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,630
And the entry for a block tracks
which caches in the system

14
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,410
have this block in an non-invalid state,
of course,

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,540
because the block in an invalid state
is like it's not in that cache at all.

16
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,520
And the order of accesses for

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,153
a particular block is determined
by the home slice for that block.

18
00:01:03,153 --> 00:01:05,892
That's the slice of the directory
that has the entry for this block.

19
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:09,570
We call that the home
slice of the directory.

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,810
So pretty much,
accesses that go to the same block

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,060
are almost serialized in how
they can access their entry.

22
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,130
And the order in which that happens

23
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,320
is the order in which the accesses
are officially said to happen.

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,400
Note that with a directory protocol,

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,800
the caches still have the same
states they did with snooping.

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,590
It's just now when we
send a request to read or

27
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,080
write, that request no
longer goes on a bus.

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,220
It gets sent via our
network to the directory.

29
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,610
So we can have many requests
traveling to their individual slices.

30
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,930
And then the directory
figures out what to do.
