1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,290
These are Android Wear watches.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,490
The first thing that you'll notice
is that they don't look like other

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,580
Android devices.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,650
Now this is key,

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,720
because they are used differently than
other devices like a phone or tablet.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,030
The UI is different.

7
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,680
They're worn,
instead of put pocket, and so on.

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,540
The second you'll notice is that
these watches are as diverse as

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,530
the broad set of users who wear them.

10
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,450
You might be dealing
with a square screen, or

11
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,520
a round screen, your user might
be a runner or might be a pilot.

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,920
Instead of fighting these issues,
embrace them by designing an app

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,320
that works great on any watch and
in any situation that makes sense.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,530
The good news is that from the
perspective of actually writing code,

15
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,020
these watches look very similar
to Android phones and tablets.

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,800
Much of the underlying
software is exactly the same.

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,340
Even the hardware is basically the same
with similar senses and functionality.

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,880
So once you learn all the new
paradigms of designing for

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,430
a wearable, you can jump in a familiar
Android territory to build it.

20
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,660
>> In this introductory lesson,
I'll give you an overview of the design

21
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,700
philosophy and
platform components of Android Wear.

22
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,560
But first, let's start with the demo.
