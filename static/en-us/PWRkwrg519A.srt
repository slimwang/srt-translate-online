1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,151
So, actually only two of these are true. A function maps each element of its

2
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:09,212
domain to exactly one element of its range. And a function also can be seen as a

3
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:13,853
relation between a set of inputs and a set of outputs. However, none of the

4
00:00:13,853 --> 00:00:18,222
other three choices are true. Let's look at the first one. If we had checked

5
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:23,292
this one off, we will be arguing that a function maps each element of the domain

6
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:28,040
to at least one element of the range. Now, think back to that soda machine

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,279
example. The soda machine operated like the function, because for any amount of

8
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,183
money you put in, there's only one option for the amount of soda that you could

9
00:00:36,183 --> 00:00:39,973
get out. Functions work like beautiful machines in the same way. They're

10
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:44,844
deterministic. A single input can only lead to one single output. So, the second

11
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:48,224
one must be right instead of the first one. Now, we know that this last choice

12
00:00:48,224 --> 00:00:52,046
isn't true. Because there are some equations with two variables that aren't

13
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:55,676
functions and we haven't delved super deep into this. But you already know that

14
00:00:55,676 --> 00:00:59,484
there has to be a special relationship between those two variables, namely, this

15
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:03,939
one. That the independent variable can only map to one value of the dependent

16
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:08,519
variable, and not all equations with two variables do that. For example, we

17
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,712
might have x equals y squared, which is a horizontal parabola. Or we might have

18
00:01:13,712 --> 00:01:17,520
x squared plus y squared equals 4, which gives us a circle. Neither of these

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,670
passed the vertical line test, which we talked about before, so they're not

20
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,820
functions. And they don't pass the vertical line test because they don't meet

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,056
this criteria. And finally, if we said that functions must have a defined value

22
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:32,272
for any real numbers input, then we would be saying that the domain of every

23
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:36,614
single function has to be all the real numbers and that's just not the case. We

24
00:01:36,614 --> 00:01:40,134
talked about two different major types of domain restrictions that prevent

25
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:44,020
certain real numbers from being within the domains of certain functions. We'll

26
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,150
talk about even more of these cases later on. You just have to wait a couple of

27
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,663
weeks for some really, really exciting stuff. I know the past couple of lessons

28
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:54,750
have required a pretty major paradigm shift in terms of the way that we think

29
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,984
about the relationship of variables to one another, and what equations really

30
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:01,594
are. But I hope that you've found our work with functions interesting, and I

31
00:02:01,594 --> 00:02:04,842
think that it will prove more and more helpful as we continue to use the

32
00:02:04,842 --> 00:02:08,258
function paradigm in our problem solving especially in our setting up of

33
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:09,839
equations. Great job.
