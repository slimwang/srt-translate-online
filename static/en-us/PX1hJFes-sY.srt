1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,290
Now let's have a little more fun by
combining operators and assignment.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,600
Let's create a variable called
totalPayroll and set it equal to zero.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,080
Let's also create some other
variables to hold the salaries of

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,129
three hypothetical players on,
say an athletics team.

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,090
One way we can calculate the total
payroll with salaries is to do this,

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,000
which isn't too bad,
it all fits on one line.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,050
But in certain cases we may want
to only add one salary at a time.

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,960
And if we were to do this,

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,200
then our calculations would change
to say something like this.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,770
In this case.

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,260
we add one salary at a time to
the existing value of total payroll.

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,060
So this isn't too bad.

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,090
If we want to add them one at a time,
but we can do better than this by

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,450
combining assignment and
the plus operator all at the same time.

15
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,380
And we can do this by using
the operator we want, in this case,

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,560
the addition operator
followed by an equals sign.

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,540
And while this may be
confusing at first,

18
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,550
let's look at how the operator
reads from left to right.

19
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:04,220
First, we want to add to our existing
value and then we want to assign.

20
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,650
And we can also do this with
other operators like subtraction,

21
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,520
multiplication, division and
the modules operator.

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,870
So go ahead and fix this up, now we got
the same value by combining the addition

23
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,920
and assignment for
the addition assignment operator.

24
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,980
If you want to see this with a different
operator, we can change all these signs

25
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,991
to subtraction signs and now our
total payroll is negative 2, 500,000.

26
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:32,620
And this would be more appropriate
if we wanted to show deficit

27
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,480
after paying our players as opposed to
the total payroll that we saw earlier.
