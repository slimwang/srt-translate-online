00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:03,557
Well the answer--this an important answer--is insensitive.

2
00:00:03,557 --> 00:00:08,779
It doesn't matter, the structure of the matrix. It's insensitive to the structure of the matrix.

3
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:12,416
It doesn't matter if we have short rows, long rows, all rows the same length,

4
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,315
rows of wildly different lengths.

5
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:17,683
The performance of the multiplications and the performance of the segmented scan

6
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:21,152
don't depend on the distribution of elements under rows at all.

7
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:24,269
Instead the run time is dependent only on the number of elements.
