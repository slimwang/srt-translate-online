1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,250
Okay, well, so it should be pretty clear that it's A and C.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,390
Why?

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,910
because the sigma is what defines the blurring.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,520
And then the constant in the front, remember the one, and

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,280
one over two pi sigma squared, okay?

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,230
That just multiplies everything, so that's just going to change the brightness.

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,970
So fundamentally, what matters is the size of the sigma or sigma squared.
