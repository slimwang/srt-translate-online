1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,166
Since our t statistic is past this critical value, out here in the critical

2
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:09,856
region, we'll reject the null. This means that participants made significantly

3
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:15,230
fewer errors, using the QWERTY keyboard compared to the alphabetical keyboard.

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,820
Since this was an experimental design, we can make causal statements. So we can

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,463
say that they type of keyboard had a causal effect on the number of errors.
