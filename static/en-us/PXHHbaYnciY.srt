00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,566
What formula describes what you did. To find the number of standard deviations

2
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:12,939
each values from the mean. Let's go over a values X. So in the case of me, X was

3
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:19,028
63. In the case of Andy X was 54. Was it Mu minus X. Or did we do X minus Mu. X

4
00:00:19,028 --> 00:00:25,492
minus Mu times sigma. X minus Mu divided sigma. Mu minus X times sigma. Or did

5
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:31,069
we do mu minus x divided by sigma? Now remember that in the last two quizzes you

6
00:00:31,069 --> 00:00:36,712
got a positive number. So we're just looking for the formula that describes the

7
00:00:36,712 --> 00:00:39,980
positive distance that we were from the mean.
