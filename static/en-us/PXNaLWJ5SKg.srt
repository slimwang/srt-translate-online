1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,280
Okay, so the first thing we're
going to need is an ID column,

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,830
because nothing else here is unique.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,500
We'll relate donors to their phone
numbers, using the donor's ID.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,020
The ID is arbitrary, as long as the one
here equals the one down here, but

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,110
we'll just put 1,
because Mary is the first donor.

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,630
The second thing we know
about a donor is their name.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,390
And we know their favorite animal.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,470
Now, Mary has two phones, so

9
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,540
there will be two rows in donor
phones with Mary's id in them.

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,049
And Mary has two kinds of phone,
one is a home phone and one is a mobile.

11
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,910
We'll call that column phone type.

12
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,370
And finally we know
Mary's phone numbers.

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,450
So there you have it, you've taken
all the data from this object

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,660
oriented record and
structured it into database tables.
