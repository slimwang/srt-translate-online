00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,855
>> Now x, which is the amount of length and width we're adding to the booth, is

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:07,927
the variable that we're going to want to solve for in this equation. Right now,

3
00:00:07,927 --> 00:00:11,624
we don't know how to do this. There's this x squared term, and it's kind of

4
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:15,560
confusing to think about what you do with that. So let's learn. First of all, I

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,709
don't like having constant terms on both sides of the equal sign. We can pretty

6
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:23,552
easily make that not be the case. If I want to get rid of the 300 over here on

7
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:27,207
the left, then what am I going to be left with on the right? Fill in this box

8
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:30,983
with the expression that belongs in the right-hand side of the equation that

9
00:00:30,983 --> 00:00:33,816
will be left after I legally get rid of 300 from the left.
