1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,670
So what are the good properties of a Harris Detector?

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,090
One, a Harris Detector is rotation invariant.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,560
In this case, basically what that means is that ellipses rotate, but

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,320
the shape and the eigenvalues remain the same, if this image is rotated.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,508
And therefore, corner response function R is invariant to rotations.

6
00:00:17,508 --> 00:00:21,050
So in essence, I could take the same thing, rotate it, it'll find the same

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,760
Harris Corners as it did when, you know, the image was not rotated.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,310
Intensity invariant which basically means is that if the intensity of

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,680
the image changes because of photometric variations and

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,430
stuff it's actually not sensitive to it.

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,410
So it's basically partially invariance additive and melt, multiplicative

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,280
intensity changes because of thresholding that we can do with this.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,500
And it actually supports us being able to deal with highly intense images.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,130
Primarily also again, because we're only looking for derivative information,

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,610
that is the derivative change in intensity not just the absolute one.

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,500
So in essence, again, you notice, same image.

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,430
Now I've increased the intensity but find the same features.

18
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,868
Finally, scaling invariant.

19
00:01:02,868 --> 00:01:06,310
Basically it's dependent on the size of the window we use for matching.

20
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,170
Of course, we can also use different types of

21
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,860
frequency domain analysis using pyramids to help us do matching of that type.
