00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,990
Let's wrap up this lesson.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:07,190
We've talked about three key ways
to compute the value of a company.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,010
Intrinsic value,
which is based on future dividends.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,870
In other words, companies pay a certain
amount to their investors every year,

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,130
based on how many shares they own.

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,200
And this is the value of all future
dividends going into the future.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,620
Book value, which is the value of the
company if we split it up into pieces

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,210
and sold those individual pieces.

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,890
And finally market
capitalization which is

10
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,840
simply the value that the market
is placing on the company.

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,630
So, many stock trading strategies
look for deviations between say,

12
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:51,040
intrinsic value and market cap if
intrinsic value drops significantly and

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:57,840
the stock price say is high, it may
be worthwhile to short that stock.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,620
Or if say dividends are going up and
the market capitalization is low it

15
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,589
might be an opportunity
to buy the stock.

16
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:10,570
And similarly book value
provides a sort of lowest

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,740
price, when stock price begins
to approach book value, you

18
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,860
can pretty much assume that the price
is not going to go below book value.

19
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,220
Or not much below it,
because if it does,

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,490
a predatory buyer would buy the whole
company, and break it up for parts.

21
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,210
Anyhow, that's company valuation.

22
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,435
And I look forward to seeing
you at the next lesson.

23
00:01:33,435 --> 00:01:34,764
Bye bye.
