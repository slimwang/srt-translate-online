00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,460
This brings us to the topic of creativity. We humans are naturally very

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,200
creative, and I'm not talking just about an Einstein or a Mozart. You and

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,660
I are very creative on an every day basis. You and

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,610
I constantly deal with our problems. And with dealing with our problems,

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,320
we don't just give up, we address them and most of the time fairly successfully.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,800
Now the goal of knowledge-based AI is to create AI agents that can think and

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,250
act like humans. So shouldn't we also create knowledge-based AI agents that

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:35,250
are creative? But in order to answer this, we have to define what is creativity.

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,250
In lesson one, we saw how hard it was to define intelligence.

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,370
Defining creativity is no less hard. But we will give it a try anyway.
