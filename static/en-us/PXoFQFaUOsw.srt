1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
But first of all, let's play a little bit more with the numbers.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,450
Let's say I make the following table here.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:11,860
This is the number of instances you need to solve--say 1, 100, 10,000 and this is

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:18,400
the size of the instances, and this is the size of the instances, so smaller than 10, smaller than 20,

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,120
smaller than 30 or larger than 100.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,800
And now let's say you have algorithm that has running time 2^n.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,090
We'll simplify this here, so as the running time is 2^n, no O off, no polynomial involved.

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,540
All I want you to get here is a filling full of numbers.

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,950
Now, what I would like you to think about is in which case you see a brute force

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,580
would be something to try out.

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,400
If you think that you should try brute force either you're sure about it

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,480
or it's at least something to think about, then I would like you to make a check mark

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,220
in these boxes here and otherwise, leave the box blank, and of course, this is very subjective.

14
00:00:52,220 --> 99:59:59,999
