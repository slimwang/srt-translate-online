1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,440
It's a very rapidly changing field.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,181
That's where the landscape
changes constantly,

3
00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:07,830
the technologies change constantly.

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,880
How does one become a successful
cyber security professional?

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,010
From your perspective, I guess,
I'm sure you have heard about what

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,440
it means to be a successful cyber
security professional on your side?

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,110
>> Well I think to be successful,
I mean, you can't stand still.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,900
To stand still is to get left behind.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,640
So you have to have a passion for
the discipline.

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,860
And to really be a constant learner and
being able to think creatively and

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,820
consume and learn and create new things
and also be interested in how to take

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,910
things apart and push technologies
in ways that they weren't intended.

13
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,900
I also think though to be successful,
you have to be trustworthy.

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,020
Because by studying
information security,

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,270
you're learning effectively dangerous
skills that you have to use wisely.

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,350
People will put their trust into you and
you have to respect that.

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,170
That's really a key, probably the key
underpinning the whole discipline.

18
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:12,565
A willingness to teach others about
this in a way that's the right language.

19
00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:13,975
Taking a step back,

20
00:01:13,975 --> 00:01:17,620
I'd say you have to be able to
communicate technical subjects

21
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,440
to non-technical audiences in a way
that's understandable and meaningful.

22
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,720
How you communicate with
potentially board of directors,

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,210
there's a whole lexicon of how you
communicate with senior business leaders

24
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,690
or senior military leaders, or students.

25
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:36,220
It varies, so you have to be very
adaptive and be willing to learn and

26
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,480
respect the cultures which you're trying
to interact with in a positive way.
