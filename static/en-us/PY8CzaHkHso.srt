1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,310
So while we now know how a camera, or what's inside a camera,

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,360
let's go back to basics and begin understanding what is happening or

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,400
what we are trying to do when we take a picture.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,330
What we're trying to do is capture a 3D scene and

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,170
create an image of something that can be displayed to a user and,

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,580
of course, what we're going to capture is the light in the scene.

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,130
In addition to that, what we also want to capture is the 3Dness of the scene.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,350
For example here, there is a lot of geometry in the scene, right?

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,670
Which basically is shown in the perspective.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,680
For example, these two train tracks are kind of converging at a point.

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,610
I mean this is actually something in the imaging field known

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,020
as the vanishing point.

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,330
All things like this, if I was to draw a line here on this train track and

14
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,650
another one on this train track,

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,320
you kind of see that they're converging far away at some point.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,790
This is basically showing perspective, that is,

17
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,310
things that are farther away appear smaller.

18
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,340
Things that are closer appear you know, larger.

19
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,760
So this distance is large here but, of course, train tracks kind of get smaller.

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,850
So what we're trying to capture here is the geometry of a scene.

21
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:08,740
In addition to that,

22
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:13,720
we're also trying to capture from a scene varies types of light changes.

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,750
So here, of course, a scene just showing sand with water.

24
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,790
You see specularity, you see waves,

25
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,019
you see reflections, you see diffusity of an image and all that kind of stuff.

26
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:23,873
So, of course,

27
00:01:23,873 --> 00:01:27,930
in this image what we're trying to do is capture all of the light variations.

28
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,940
Besides just the color, the specularities and stuff like that.

29
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,640
So in essence, what we are trying to capture is the light scattering.

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,270
So the two essential things we are capturing in a scene like this,

31
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,730
shown by these two images, is the geometry, that is the perspective changes,

32
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,880
the size of the space, the 3Dness of the space and

33
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,730
how the light is kind of reflecting off the environment across the board.

34
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,596
To achieve this, of course, that's what the camera is there,

35
00:01:55,596 --> 00:02:00,428
it's trying to capture and depict the scene from 3D into a 2D representation.

36
00:02:00,428 --> 00:02:04,410
Of course, available to us is a camera and again,

37
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,160
when we looked at the insides of a camera, we saw different things it has.

38
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,660
First thing is, of course, the optics and the lens of the camera.

39
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,350
Here I'm basically showing you that by just opening the aperture of the camera,

40
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,570
you can actually get more light into the camera.

41
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,080
More light into the camera is an important thing and also, how much of it will

42
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,890
actually get into the sensor is another part of the whole process we want to try

43
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,810
to understand because, in essence, what we are trying to do is capture light.

44
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,050
So the other thing available to us, of course, is the sensor itself and

45
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,150
the sensor itself could have a variety of different characteristics on how it

46
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,440
captures the color and the light variations that are captured from the scenes.

47
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,090
So, in essence, the light goes through this,

48
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,750
when it hits the sensor, and that's what we saw in one of the slides earlier,

49
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,440
it also kind of adds a variability on what we would capture.

50
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,720
So, in essence, going from 3D scene to a display, what we are going through is

51
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,970
a pipeline of wanting to capture perspective and light scattering from a scene

52
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,770
using the light opening and what the kind of sensor we used to be able to

53
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,440
create an image, a depiction of the 3D scene that we're trying to capture.
