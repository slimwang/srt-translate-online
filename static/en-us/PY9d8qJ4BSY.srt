1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[Man] The first answer is yes, this is a good representation

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
of the sentence "Sam has 2 jobs."

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It says there exists an x and y, and one of them is a job of Sam.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The other one is a job of Sam, and crucially, we have to say that x is not equal to y.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Otherwise, this would be satisfied and we could have the same job

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
represented by the variables x and y.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Is this a good representation of the member function?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
No.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It does do a good job of telling you what is a member,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so if x is a member of a set because it's one member

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and then we can always add other members and it's still a member of that set,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but it doesn't tell you anything about what x is not a member of.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So for example, we want to know that 3 is not a member of the empty set,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
but we can't prove that with what we have here.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And we have a similar problem down here.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is not a good representation of adjacent relation.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So it will tell you, for example, that square (1,1) is adjacent to square (2,1)

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and also to square (1,2).

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So it's doing something right, but one problem is that it doesn't tell you in the other direction.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It doesn't tell you that (2,1) is adjacent to (1,1)

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and another problem is that it doesn't tell you that (1,1) is not adjacent to (8,9)

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
because again, there's no way to prove the negative.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And the moral is that when you're trying to do a definition,

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
like adjacent or member, what you usually want to do

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
is have a sentence with the equivalent or the biconditional sign

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
to say this is true if and only if rather than to just have an assertion

27
00:02:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or to have an implication in one direction.
