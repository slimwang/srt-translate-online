00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
Today we're going to talk about partners.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,070
Who are your key partners and suppliers?

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,410
We've already talked about value propositions, customer segments,

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,740
distribution channels, customer relationships, and revenue streams.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,050
Now we're going to talk about our partners.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,830
What's interesting about partners is these are other companies

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,430
who provide you resources.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,330
They might be partners, they might be suppliers,

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,390
but they're needed to make your business model work,

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,170
and these partners and suppliers might supply or give you

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,520
resources, activities, and other things that are essential

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,770
for your company to succeed.

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,820
So what you need to understand is what type of relationships

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,390
you need to have with them.

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,650
Are these relationships going to be strategic alliances

16
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,540
between noncompeting companies?

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,510
Are they going to be joint ventures?

18
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,760
Are they going to be coopetition?

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,280
What are you going to do, and what are they going to do?

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,900
So, in this lecture, we are going to explain

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,150
the differences, the pitfalls, and the successes between each.
