1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is zero, one.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If this expression over here,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
F of X,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
grows to positive infinity,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
then Z becomes one.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And the reason is

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
as this term over here becomes very large,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
E to the minus of that term approaches zero;

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
one over one equals one.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If F of X goes to minus infinity,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
then Z goes to zero.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And the reason is,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
if this expression over here goes to minus infinity,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
E to the infinity becomes very large;

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
one over something very large becomes zero.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
When we plot the logistic function it looks like this:

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So it's approximately linear

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
around F of X equals zero,

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
but it levels off to zero and one

20
00:00:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
as we go to the extremes.
