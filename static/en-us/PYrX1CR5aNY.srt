1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,920
The correct answer is sp or
scale-independent pixels.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,260
If you use dips, that piece of
text has a specific physical size.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,630
No matter if the user has set
their preferred text size.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,500
Android won't prevent you from using
other units of measure like pixels,

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,500
millimeters or dips.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,690
But you should always remember to
use sp or scale-independent pixels.
