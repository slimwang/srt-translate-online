1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,020
Then mention new content.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,650
And you've learned how
to publish your apps.

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,570
But you may be wondering,
what should I learn next?

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,550
At this point, you're prepared to
take most of our Android courses.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,540
But I want to draw your
attention to two in particular.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,270
Our Gradle course, Gradle for Android
and Java, is a great look at the build

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,380
system we've been using
alongside Android Studio.

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,430
In that class, you learn the magic
behind the Android build process.

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,110
And customize your build by creating
multiple app flavors, incorporating

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,660
external libraries and tools, and
adding units and integration tests.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,530
The other course you're now ready for,
is our performance course,

12
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,590
featuring a lot more cult.

13
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,640
Performance is vital if you want to make
that move smoothly on older devices.

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,330
And get a more global audience for
your app.

15
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,260
I've added links to each class in
the instructor notes below the video.

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,220
Take some time to build the final
project for this class first.

17
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,720
And then choose a direction.

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,130
We can't wait to see what you'll build.
