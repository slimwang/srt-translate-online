00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,420
Markers are used to indicate
a location on a map.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,260
You're probably familiar with a typical
Google marker from using maps and

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,060
if not, you soon will be, or

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,450
if you prefer to customize it with
your own marker, well that's good too.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,210
For the next few minutes,
I'll show you how to do exactly that.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,740
You'll build an app that
has a map in it and

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,490
this map will have a set of markers for
specific locations.

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,120
You may have a business
that has many locations.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,810
And you want your app to show your
users where these locations are, or

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,790
you could for example,
be part of a sports organization

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,280
that has a number of
locations where you play.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,490
It's much easier to show this
type of information on a map.

13
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,530
And markers are the way to go here.

14
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,420
Let's take a look at an app like
that and we'll see how to build it.
