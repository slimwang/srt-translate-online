1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,660
You'll notice that we can handle
exceptions by at least logging

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,230
error conditions,

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,680
then at least we have some trace
left behind when an error happened.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,300
It's better than catching
the exception and

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,900
doing absolutely nothing,
which is known as failing silently.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,436
So in this task, I want you to make the
following modifications to Soonami app.

7
00:00:17,436 --> 00:00:19,845
In the makehttprequest method,

8
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:25,010
I want you to log the HTTP response
code if the status code is not 200.

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:30,292
Also, log the IOException
if it gets thrown.

10
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:33,047
Notice that we disconnect
the HTTP connection and

11
00:00:33,047 --> 00:00:36,400
enclose the input stream
the moment we're done using them.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,509
And since we added the code to a finally
block, we know our code will get

13
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:42,314
executed regardless of whether or
not an exception is thrown.

14
00:00:42,314 --> 00:00:45,679
So by disconnecting the URLConnection
and closing the input stream,

15
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,272
we're actually cleaning up and
we're releasing scarce operating system

16
00:00:49,272 --> 00:00:51,568
resources that can now be used for
other tasks.

17
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:54,020
Now go ahead and complete these tasks.

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,480
If you need help, see the hint below
the quiz or you can reference the other

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,990
examples of try-catch blocks
in the Soonami app code.
