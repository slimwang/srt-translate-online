1
00:00:00,285 --> 00:00:03,819
Let's look more closely to these factor variables. For

2
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:06,906
now i want to draw your attention to the age.range variable

3
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:09,940
right here. Notice that it says that we have a

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,140
factor variable with seven different levels. We can examine the

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,820
levels of a variable, by typing in the command levels

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,320
and then putting it the variable right here. In the

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,020
console we can see the seven levels of the age.range

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,660
variable. Now, instead of creating a table of the age.range

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,880
variable, let's create a plot that shows how many users

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,720
are in each bin. That is, we want to figure out how

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,020
many surveyed respondents are between the ages of 18 and

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,450
24, 25 and 34, and so on. I'm going to create this

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,200
plot using the ggplot2 package, and the qplot function that

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,220
comes with it. Again, don't worry about understanding this code too

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,830
much, we'll have practice with this in the next lesson.

16
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,280
When I run this code, I get my plot over here.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,140
Zooming in on this plot, I want you to notice

18
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,180
that the age groups appear to be in order. This is

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,080
true for everyone except the survey takers who are under

20
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,140
the age of 18. Now, it would be really helpful if

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,250
this bar was really oriented over here. That way we

22
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,900
could make comparisons across the groups more easily. Now this is

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,930
why we would want to have ordered factors. The variable age.range just

24
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,310
contains factors with seven levels, but these levels aren't arranged in

25
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,730
any particular order. Sometimes you want to introduce order into our

26
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,840
data set. So that way we can make more readable plots.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,360
So, knowing a little bit about ordered factors, let's see

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,540
if you can answer this next question. If you haven't already

29
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,375
done so, download the Reddit survey data and look at

30
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:35,820
its structure. After you looked at the structure of the variables,

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,790
try and answer this question. Which of these variables in

32
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,130
the data set could also be converted to an ordered factor?

33
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,090
Just like H.Range.

34
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,860
>> Check any of the variables that apply.
