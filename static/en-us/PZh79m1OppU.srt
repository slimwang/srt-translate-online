00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,510
Until now,

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:06,860
we've given you a demo, but what we're
really interested in is production.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,330
The goal of this course is to
get you ready for scaling and

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,070
managing containers in production.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,630
So, let's do that now.

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,370
That's where deployments come in.

7
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,550
See, deployments are a declarative
way to say what goes where.

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,690
The used in four state is
given by the end user.

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,650
Behind the scenes deployments use
a Copa90's concept called replica sets

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,730
to ensure that the current number
of Pods equals the desired number.

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,980
When it comes to managing Pods,
deployment destruct away the low level

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,110
details like what node is my Pod on,
where is it running.

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,590
Pods are tied to
the lifetime of the Node.

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,010
So, when the Node goes away,
so does the Pod.

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,730
Instead of managing that we can
use deployments to make our

16
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,400
life a little easier.

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,890
In the example on screen you'll see
that we have a Pod with one replica.

18
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,090
Well, what happens when we change the
number of replicas from one to three.

19
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,280
Our deployment will go ahead and

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,240
ensure that the number of replicas in
production matches are desired state.

21
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,440
This means that even if a Node goes
down like Node3 just in our example,

22
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,790
the deployment will start a new Pod and
find somewhere to put it for us and

23
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,340
that's pretty cool.

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,870
It's time to combine everything we've
learned so far about Pods and service

25
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,710
and the breaking up the Monolith App in
a smaller services using deployments.
