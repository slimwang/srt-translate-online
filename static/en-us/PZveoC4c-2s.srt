00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,240
Thanks, Sarah.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,500
Now once again, everything I'll be doing in this lesson,

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,140
I can do completely offline.

4
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,640
I won't internet access to create a repository or add commits to it.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,540
That's why I'm here at the forest again.

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,950
First, I'm going to create a Git repository.

7
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,239
I can either do this in an empty directory and create files later or

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,520
I can create the repository in a directory that already contains files.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,000
Right now, I'm going to use an existing directory with some recipes.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,467
I'll run ls dash a.

11
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:26,770
And I can see that there are three recipes here.

12
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,330
A cake recipe, a frosting recipe and a chili recipe.

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,210
Notice that there isn't a .git directory because this isn't a git

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,760
repository yet.

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,800
Now I'll run git init, which initializes or creates a new Git repository.

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,980
Now if I run ls dash a again,

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,340
I can see that the .git directory has been created.

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,470
How many commits do you think the new Git repository contains?

19
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,210
Enter your answer in this box.

20
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,900
And recall that commit is a snapshot out of a Git repository.

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,250
If you're not sure how many commits it will contain,

22
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,280
then just pick a number you think is reasonable.

23
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,890
Next, what command could you use to find out the answer to

24
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,520
the previous question?

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,290
Here's a hint.

26
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,459
This is a Git command that you learned last lesson.
