00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Let's see if we can figure out what happens when an app is terminated in

00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,690
the background. Start the app again then hit the Home key. Now launch some other

00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,240
apps before returning to ours. Try and pick apps with large memory footprints.

Can you figure out, which of the following lifecycle event handlers is the last

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,000
one guaranteed to be called, before your app maybe terminated by the runtime?
