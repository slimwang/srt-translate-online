00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,123
We can use these values for h and k and insert them into that general expanded

2
00:00:06,123 --> 00:00:12,035
form of the equation for a parabola to rewrite this, like this. Y equals x

3
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:18,396
squared minus 2 times negative 3x plus negative 3 squared plus negative 4. Now,

4
00:00:18,396 --> 00:00:22,976
we're ready to write this in the form we saw those other equations in. Y minus k

5
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:27,586
equals the quantity x minus h squared. Please do that in this box right here.

6
00:00:27,586 --> 00:00:31,840
Once you've done that, I'd also like to, to tell me the coordinates of the

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,385
vertex of this parabola.
