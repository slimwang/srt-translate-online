1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,969
So, so real time analytic's.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:07,790
Again real time analytic's can be broadly divided into two different segments.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,870
And the first one is what you call as real time streaming.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,395
And in streaming what you do is you do

5
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:19,600
analytic's immediately after data is produced.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,135
So the moment where data is produced, it goes through some kind of

7
00:00:23,135 --> 00:00:26,350
real-time pipeline and it's constantly spitting out analytic's.

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,820
And one of the characteristics of streaming is the analytics is

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,290
running continuously on and on for days and months, keeps on running.

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,530
The second broad real-time analytic's is what we call as interactive.

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,710
And so in this case, what happens is like the analytics is the data,

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,610
whatever data is stored in some kind of persistent storage,

13
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,730
later it might be in the disks, or flash, or whatever might be the case, and

14
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:57,390
whenever you like to look at some kind of analytic's on top of this data.

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,080
You kind of come up with a query or I do a job, whatever it is.

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,250
Then moment you find the job, and it should return it in a few seconds or

17
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,610
even in milliseconds.

18
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:12,210
So the whole idea is like you are exploring the data, then you

19
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,840
discover something, then immediately you wanted to drill down farther into that.

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,120
So that it's kind of funny.

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,590
It gives you a more often interactive session.

22
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,790
And in order to be interactive, you don't want to be like, I type a query,

23
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,200
go and have a coffee, and chat with my friends, and

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,620
come back, and the analytic's is ready.

25
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,410
Because that cycle is too long.

26
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,630
So in a manner of seconds and

27
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,079
milliseconds, if it comes back, then you need it more productive.

28
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,300
So the focus of the, the whole Udacity code says with respect to streaming.

29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,800
Because the storm is essentially a tool,

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,840
to get your streaming analytics down as quickly as possible.

31
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,900
That is a border.

32
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,450
So now what is real time?

33
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,060
I mean in different domains and different markets and

34
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,820
different enterprises, real time means different things for different people.

35
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,180
So loosely, like, we define, real time in certain ways.

36
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,889
But before we get to what exactly it is, let us see the spectrum of,

37
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,640
what are the various type of, what do you call?

38
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,990
The time duration.

39
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,885
So the first is, what we call is a [INAUDIBLE] systems so

40
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:21,860
[INAUDIBLE] systems tend to have, kind of defined millisecond budget.

41
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,040
And, that is probably the fastest, kind of analytics that you can think of.

42
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,210
And it is very latency-sensitive.

43
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,650
In the sense, like, whenever a, let's say you go to an ATM and

44
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,350
say I'm withdrawing some money, and immediately the account has to be updated.

45
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,760
Similarly, like whenever a tweet is what do you call,

46
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,770
posted by you, like then you might have a lot of followers.

47
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,150
And those followers have to get the tweet right away.

48
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,530
Within a budget of 500 milliseconds.

49
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,180
So think about doing that kind of, what do you call, fall-out.

50
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,610
That's what we call the term.

51
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,760
The fall-out for 30 million users.

52
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,230
For example, in the case of Obama having 30, or 33, or 35 million users.

53
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,450
How do you replicate that tweet, whatever he does for

54
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,169
all his followers in within 500 milliseconds.

55
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,599
So on the other end of the spectrum is like the batch which takes a lot of

56
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,120
hours and days and that is a characteristic by high throughput,

57
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,400
because the reason why the batch takes long amount of

58
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,830
time is because of in the sense like you're munging through so much data.

59
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,550
And you've there's a lot of data than the disk class is

60
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,510
limitation of 100 megabytes per second.

61
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:41,180
You can more, go more than that so, so in order to what would combat limitation?

62
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,480
We'll employ multiple disks, so that you can get some,

63
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,260
there some simultaneously across each disk.

64
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,210
Seen parallel.

65
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,990
So, when you employ a lot of such disk and

66
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,210
the data is much higher than that it takes hours and

67
00:03:54,210 --> 00:04:00,150
days and hence is very important for this kind of anal, batch analytic's.

68
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,910
And mostly the batch analytic's is used for doing idol queries.

69
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,080
And in between the two.

70
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,700
It's what we call loosely a real time.

71
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,620
I mean, in the sense like, it's like, a few seconds.

72
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,660
And one of the characteristics of the real time is

73
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,930
what you call this approximation.

74
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,710
So the real time may not be very exact.

75
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,520
I mean, there could be requirements where it could be exact, but

76
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,060
from a strong definition point of view or from intuitive notion point of view.

77
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,330
Real time is more an approximation.

78
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:39,110
So, so that it gives the visibility into your business right away,

79
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,140
or, or that you are monitoring for real time analytics right away.

80
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,160
And still, it gives you some kind of a approximate AD.

81
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,810
And so, one of the I mean.

82
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,510
Downsides of the approximation is how close are you to exact?

83
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:59,000
So there should be some kind of, bounds to, the actual real value, right?

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,450
So as long as the, the approximation is like 5 to 10 percent off from the,

85
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,270
actual values, then you're okay.

86
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,890
So, so then what we also do at Twitter is, like, we do run a batch analytics.

87
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,230
But that is, comes a little bit like four or five hours later.

88
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,950
On fixes this approximations of real time as real time keeps forging ahead.

89
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,700
So, so

90
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,572
that is where we kind of what do you call this a more of real time [INAUDIBLE].

91
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:26,230
[INAUDIBLE] is a few seconds.

92
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,780
Now why we do Real Time,

93
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,000
we should be care that we, things should be in real time.

94
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,010
And world is going, going real time.

95
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,310
And of course tutor is synonymous with real time and

96
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,790
that there's a bunch of examples.

97
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,250
First there's real time trends.

98
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,670
Of course, Twitter is known for break, break out news stories.

99
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,500
Break, break our incidents.

100
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,360
And that spreads like fire in real time.

101
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,630
So, so to be able to be on top of.

102
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,400
Real time clients.

103
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,170
Second aspect is real time conversations.

104
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,900
As you're watching a sports game, and

105
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,590
surf some either somebody scored or something that they did and

106
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,590
people, you want to instantly start a conversation, Twitter is one the places

107
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,640
where people start a conversation and millions of conversations keep going.

108
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,110
At any given time.

109
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:22,410
And third aspect is real time recommendations.

110
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,490
As these real time trends and conversations are emerging.

111
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,520
To the ones who take advantage of those,

112
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,870
by injecting the appropriate product recommendation during the time.

113
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,700
So that people can do some kind of impulsive buying.

114
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,790
Or even add, so that you can click on those ads,

115
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,910
which translates into bottom line for us.

116
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,522
So then finally, like, Real Time search, where, as, new events and

117
00:06:46,522 --> 00:06:49,460
Real Time incidents and trends are happening and

118
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,360
you wanted to search it because, in your, in the context of [INAUDIBLE]

119
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,440
you will be getting those incidents with respect to whomever you are following.

120
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,060
But the search that I put in allows you to search for all the tweet.

121
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,460
So in other words as these tweets are coming in,

122
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:10,181
we have to continuously mix them so that when you go to it is Real Time.

123
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:13,453
In the sense like all the tweets that happen in the last second or

124
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:15,925
last few second is immediately available to you.

125
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:18,120
As part of the search.

126
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,950
So we have a budget of less than 200 milliseconds in order to do that.

127
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,560
So some kind of discussion.

128
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,610
Louie you want to?

129
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,090
Louis you want to [INAUDIBLE] some discussion about.

130
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,520
>> Sure. >> The big data applications.

131
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,250
>> Sure so this is just a question for the group.

132
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,130
You know, what?

133
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,130
What are some the examples of Real Time systems that you've seen?

134
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,020
Real Time alo,.

135
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,820
Applications, and maybe ideas that you want to see.
