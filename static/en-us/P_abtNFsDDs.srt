Since you just got to practice a compound inequality with an and, let's try a

2
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:09,758
compound inequality with a or. So, we have 6 x plus 5 is less than 3 x plus 2,

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,565
or 2 x plus 7 is grater than x plus 11. We know since it's a or problem, we're

4
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:19,491
going to need a union. You can put your answers in these boxes, and I've already

5
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:25,559
put the union sign for you. If you need to write infinity, type in \inf and the

6
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:27,946
infinity symbol should show up.
