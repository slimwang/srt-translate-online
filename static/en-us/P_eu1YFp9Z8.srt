00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this exercise, I'm going to give you some English sentences

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and then some first-order logic sentences

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and ask you does the first-order logic sentence

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
correctly encode the English sentence, does it incorrectly encode it,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
or is it just an error that is not a legitimate sentence

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
in first-order logic?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The first English sentence is "Paris and Nice are both in France."

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Here's one possible translation.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Paris and Nice are in France.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Here's another.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Paris is in France, and Nice is in France.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Tell us if each of these is a correct encoding of English,

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
incorrect, or if it's erroneous first-order logic syntax.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The second sentence in English is "There is a country that borders Iran and Syria."

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Here are the possible translations.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There exists a c, and we're going to use the predicate capital C

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
to mean C when the argument is a country.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So, there exists a c such that C of c,

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and we're going to use the predicate B to mean 2 objects border each other.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So, c borders Iran, and c borders Syria.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's one translation. Here's the other translation.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
There exists a c if C is a country,

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:01,000
then c borders Iran and c borders Syria.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And the final English sentence is no 2 bordering countries

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
can have the same map color, and we're going to use the predicate MC for map color.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Here's one possibility for all x and y.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
X is a country, and y is a country.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And x and y border each other.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That implies it's not the case that the map color

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
of x equals the map color of y.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And I should say we're using map color here as a function, not as a predicate.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Here's another possibility.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
For all x and y, it's not the case that x is a country,

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
or it's not the case that y is a country,

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
or it's not the case that x and y border,

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
or it's not the case that the map color of x

37
00:03:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is equal to the map color of y.
