00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,650
For this problem, we're going to look at the relationships between

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,190
different kinds of graphs. We want to know if x

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,170
is the subset of y or y is the subset

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,610
of x or both or neither. We'd select this first

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,930
option. If every star graph is also a tree graph,

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,130
we pick this option. If every tree graph is also

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,240
a star graph, select this option, if both of these

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,370
are true; if every star graph is a tree graph and

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:31,350
every tree graph is a star graph. Or we'd pick this option, if neither is true.

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,690
For example, the first one is true. Every

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,110
star graph is a tree graph. In order to

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,020
get from any node, exist this simple path

13
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,000
through the center. To our target node. If we

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,290
start from the center, it's trivially easy to

15
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,420
get to any node. The reverse is not true.

16
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,040
This is an example of a tree graph that is not a star

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,980
graph. Here are the rest of the graph types for you to figure out.
