00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,810
All Android apps must be digitally
signed before they can be installed on

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,130
a device.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,119
The actual cryptography in math
of how the signing process works

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,290
is utterly fascinating, but also kind
of beyond the scope of this course.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,970
Digitally signing an app
accomplishes two things.

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,540
First, it allows Google and
users who download the app to

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,690
verify the identity of
the developer that published it.

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,600
Second, it guarantees that the app
hasn't been tampered with since

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,840
it was signed.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,210
Quite simply, signing is required for
apps on the Play Store, so

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,720
that users can be sure that the app they
are downloading was indeed published by

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,100
the listed developer.

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,080
It also protects you,
as the developer, so

14
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,690
that no one else can publish
an app under your name.

15
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,410
Gradle automatically
signs debug applications

16
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,230
with a special debug key that allows our
app to installed on development devices.

17
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,310
However, app sign with a debug key can't
be published through the Play Store.

18
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,090
In order to sign an app,
we first need to generate a key.

19
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,890
This key will be unique to you and
should be used to sign all of your apps.

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,080
We will also create a key store which
is just a special type of database

21
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,480
that we keep our key in.

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,370
Android Studio makes creating key stores
and generating keys incredibly simple.

23
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,560
Let's take a look at how this is done.
