1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,080
Next, we're going to get some
practice tracing through Turing

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,670
machine computations and
programming Turing machines.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,210
The point of these exercises is not so
that you can put on your resume

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,680
that you're good at
programming Turing machines.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,630
And if someone asks you in an interview
to write a program to test, say,

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,580
whether an input number is prime,

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,240
I wouldn't recommend trying to draw
a Turing machine stake diagram.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,130
Somehow, I doubt that
will land you the job.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,820
Rather, the point is to
help you convince yourself

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,350
that Turing machines can do everything
that we mean by computation.

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,670
And if you really had to, you could
program a Turing machine to do anything

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,660
you could write a procedure to do in
your favorite programming language.

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,200
There are two ways to
convince yourself of this.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,320
One is to just practice so

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,840
that you build up enough of a facility
with programming Turing machines.

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,000
That is to say,
it just becomes easy enough for you, so

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,950
that it seems intuitive
that you could do anything.

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,370
Another way to convince yourself
of the power of Turing machines

19
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,270
is to show that a Turing
machine can simulate the action

20
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,769
of models that are closer to real world
computers, like the random access model.

21
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,740
We'll do that in a later lesson.

22
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,610
But to be able to understand
these simulation arguments,

23
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,460
you need a pretty good facility with
how Turing machines work anyway.

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,190
So make the most of these examples and
exercises.
