00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,870
F would equal 9C divided by 5 plus 32. Nice algebra skills for figuring that one

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,985
out. We start by multiplying both sides of our equation by 9. This will create a

3
00:00:10,985 --> 00:00:15,879
fraction. And keep in mind we don't multiply these 2 terms by this 9. This whole

4
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:21,237
term is distributed to both of them. So we simplify or cancel the 9s here first.

5
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:27,404
Next we distribute 5 to F and to negative 32. We add a 160 to both sides, to

6
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:31,828
isolate 5 F. And finally we divide by the coefficient of F, which is 5 on both

7
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:37,561
sides of our equation. We divide 5 into 9 C to get 9 C 5ths. And we divide 5

8
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:42,442
into a 160 to get positive 32. Here's our equation. Now there was a different

9
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:46,286
way you could've gotten to the same result by dividing both sides here by 5,

10
00:00:46,286 --> 00:00:50,844
first. Then you would have just add the 32. I think that would've been a little

11
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:51,683
bit quicker.
