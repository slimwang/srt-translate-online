00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,169
In the previous lesson,

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:06,410
we've seen how to use share preferences
to store some settings permanently.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,589
So that when you close the app,

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:10,759
these settings are remembered
again when the app relaunches.

5
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:14,230
Databases are another form of
permanent storage in Android .They

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,550
are often used to store more complex
data to complex to share preferences.

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,839
In this lesson,
we'll see how to create and

8
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:23,992
use SQL [INAUDIBLE] databases
