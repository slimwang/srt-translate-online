1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,719
I don't know about you, but
I'm going to go with system A.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:05,900
I started with the definition
of average power for

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,100
the two systems,
which is just energy divided by time.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,690
Then, I recognize that this inequality
on time can be written a little

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,000
bit differently.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,510
Namely, 1 over the time of A is
less than 1 over the time of B.

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,230
If you now compare these two relations
to the definitions of power,

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,000
you should see that the power of
A has to be less than the power of B.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,360
You can see the same thing in
the energy time phase plot.

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,220
Power is energy over time, and

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,910
energy over time in the plot
corresponds to the slope of the lines.

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,400
And since the slope of B is
steeper than the slope of A,

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,970
then it must use more power.
