1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now let's look at the problem another way,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
in reverse.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Suppose this time that I give you

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the encoding of the finite-state machine.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I give you the accepting states, just 6, and also all of the edges.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What I would like you to do is provide me with not 1

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
but 2 strings that are accepted by this finite-state machine,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
starting in state 1, but they have to be different,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
so apply all of your knowledge, but trace it in reverse.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What would a string have to be in order to get to state 6?
