00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,460
The sixth section describes the method that you use to conduct the study.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,390
This includes the number of trials or

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,290
measurement devices and tools, any randomization techniques were appropriate,

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,000
and number of significant digits you used in your measurements and so on.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,270
This should also include an explicit statement of which subjects will be run,

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,610
and the arguments used for each of your trials. For example if you were studying

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,690
the relationship of performance to grid size, you would want to specify what

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,370
different grid sizes you will be using. The section should also briefly

9
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,710
describe any statistical techniques you will use, for example linear regression
