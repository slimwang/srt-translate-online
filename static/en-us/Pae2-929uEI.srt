1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,540
So this is what the code should
look like in the numbers activity.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,902
So by adding these ten lines of code
we're putting out each element of

3
00:00:06,902 --> 00:00:07,989
the right to the logs.

4
00:00:07,989 --> 00:00:12,034
And when I run it on my device
this is what I see in the logs.

5
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:13,690
And great it's working as expected.
