00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,192
We started out with five inches. And just like we did with the length, we just

2
00:00:05,192 --> 00:00:10,693
subtract x from each side. So, we're going to have 5 minus 2x inches. Then we

3
00:00:10,693 --> 00:00:15,389
have w equals 5 minus 2x. Cool, we have all of our dimensions covered.
