1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,960
Finally, what will our decision be? Do we fail to reject the

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,530
null, and therefore conclude that there is no significant difference between the

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,540
prices at each store? Or do we reject the null in favor

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,710
of the alternative, that at least

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,470
two stores have significantly different prices?
