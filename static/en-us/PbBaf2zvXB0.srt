00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,650
You know, the point about taking these pictures is

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,200
to tell a story, to communicate. Don't try to

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,970
win an art contest. Don't try to win a

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,670
photography contest. Don't have artistic lighting that puts some things

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,370
in shadow or in the dark. We want to show

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,300
the design features. What's really important for the designer to

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,840
understand, or for you to tell the story to

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,940
your audience? So let's take a, let's take a look.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,550
Here's a picture of a train station. I wanted to

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,680
show that accidental social cues can serve as signifiers. You

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,100
know when you rush to the train platform, how do

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,800
you know if you missed the train? Well if there

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,780
are people waiting, you probably didn't miss it. If it's

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,520
empty, oops maybe you did. So to tell the story

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,990
I had to get to the train platform long before

16
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,430
the train was scheduled to arrive, carefully lean against the post

17
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,150
sign, wasn't going to change my position, and take pictures

18
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,410
as the people arrived. More and more pictures, because

19
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,990
I didn't know when the train would come. When

20
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,870
the train finally came, I then waited until the

21
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,000
train left and the platform was empty and I

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,130
took the last picture. Was it worth it? Yes.

23
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,810
To tell the story of the destination control elevator,

24
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,460
took a lot of pictures and some editing. And even

25
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,740
editing a label to understand the picture The photos

26
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,000
took a lot of work with a photo application, because

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,890
I had to crop the photos. So you could put

28
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,010
them together properly. And I cropped the photos, so when

29
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,490
I wanted to show the controls, you saw only

30
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,070
the control and nothing else that was distracting. So, four

31
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,860
different pictures tell the story. But once again, it was

32
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,690
worth it. Sometimes a single photo is enough to make

33
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,480
the point. You don't always have to have a

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,930
sequence of photos. So here's one, a picture of push

35
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,610
and pull doors. Same hardware in both doors, yet one

36
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,870
is push and one is pull. I crop the original

37
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,430
photograph and I darkened the glass, so the objects

38
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:01,720
behind the window were not as visible. That's okay to

39
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,680
do. It would not be ethical to fake it. To

40
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,070
put objects in that really weren't in the scene, or

41
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,389
to take away things that really were present.
