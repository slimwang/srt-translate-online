1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Once I understand who my archetypes or persona is, the next thing I want to figure out

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
is how do I get them in to this funnel.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Regardless of whether it's web or mobile, I need to somehow figure out

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
how to get the interest of my customer archetypes--Dave in the major urban area

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
or Sally in the Midwest or someone in China or India.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
How do I get them interested, and there are two types of ways to create demand.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The first set of things are paid demand creation activities.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Fancy word for saying--I'm going to pay somebody to get your interest.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
First people I might want to pay is the public relations agency.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I might pay them a certain fee per month to help get stories about my products

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and or my company in newspapers or in blogs or in tech journals, etc.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And so hiring a PR agency is a paid demand creation activities.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Another common paid activity is advertising. What kind of advertising?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, it depends what my archetype reads.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If they read a blog, I want somehow get either keywords or better ads or something in the blog.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If they read newspapers, tech journals, or listen to radio or television,

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
that is I want to match my demand creation activities to what I know about my archetype.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not just going to randomly do this.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm actually going to try to match what I know to what I'm going to pay for.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Next thing could be trade shows. In some industries, people still physically go to trade shows.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Have booths, walk the aisles, meet people.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Maybe I should be in one and have a booth and maybe I'll find out my archetypes don't even care,

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and by the way, just as inside, you might also want to be worried about whether your partner show up.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Maybe they show up at trade shows.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The other thing is that I might find out that such trade shows or webinars might be interesting

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
or I just might want to be sending them e-mail or direct mail.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
US post office or post offices in other countries are still happy to carry your advertising.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Though this become less and less effective the more and more people are on the web,

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and then finally search engine marketing, Google ads or Facebook ads, etc.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
are now just a standard way to pay for demand creation activities

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
regardless of whether it's a physical channel or a mobile channel.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
All of these activities are designed to feed the sales model.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The demand creation funnel is going to fed by these things you do.
