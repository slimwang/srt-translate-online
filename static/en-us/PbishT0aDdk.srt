00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Finding the best value for a single parameter is a pretty easy thing to be doing.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's try something more difficult--optimizing the linear ramp,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that is finding the best value for the point of time at we which we start ramping out the value.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the start may be earlier, the end may be earlier,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the end maybe later, the start maybe later, and so on.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We want to find out which of this curves would produce the highest output.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Not every combination of these two parameters make sense.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We do not want this start time to be larger than the end time.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That won't really work, so in this diagram the combinations

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
below the diagram now are forbidden, and what our program will be doing,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
it will be varying both parameters between 0 and 10 years only in the allowed region

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and it will put dots in that region that show the total amount of harvest

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
for all of these combinations of parameters.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
this blue dot would mean that this specific combination of parameters

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
leads to a rather large total amount, and this smaller dot would mean

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that this combination of parameters leads to a smaller total amount and so on.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The stepping of these two parameters that control the ramp process is already done.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Your job is to compute the total amount of harvest and return it in this variable.
