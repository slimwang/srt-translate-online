1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,988
A while back, the person class had the ability to return the number of friends

2
00:00:02,988 --> 00:00:07,060
someone has. We printed the number of friends like this, which works pretty

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:12,000
well most of the time. But what if you only have one friend? It would print

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,422
out, this person has 1 friends. If you want a program to look professional and

5
00:00:16,422 --> 00:00:19,194
have output with good grammar, you often need to have the plural form and the

6
00:00:19,194 --> 00:00:24,725
singular form of a word. We're going to tackle that problem in a minute. But in

7
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:28,625
preparation, let's write a word class with a method for figuring out if a

8
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:34,230
letter is a consonant or a vowel. Here's the word class. It saves its letters

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,943
in an instance variable, letters. The is vowel method takes in an index, and

10
00:00:38,943 --> 00:00:45,245
then checks to see if the letter at that index is an a. You've probably noticed

11
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,170
that this method implementation doesn't really match the description of the

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:54,850
method. isVowel should recognize a, e, i, o, and u. Call y a consonant for now.

13
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:00,109
This isConsonant method is completely empty at the moment. It's your turn. Fix

14
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:06,300
the condition in isVowel and implement the isConsonant method. Here's a hint,

15
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,405
you shouldn't need to do 21 checks to implement isConsonant.
