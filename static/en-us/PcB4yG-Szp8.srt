00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,860
A modern operating system is a complex piece of software and lots going on, some

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,510
of which may be completely outside the user's

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,320
control. For example, a network message comes in,

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,630
and your anti virus software goes into

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,440
high gear checking for attacks. The normal behavior

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,220
of a good operating system should provide an

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,400
application with the resources is it asking for.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,930
For example, more memory or access to a file, and so on.

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,760
And get out of the way, as quickly and quietly as possible.
