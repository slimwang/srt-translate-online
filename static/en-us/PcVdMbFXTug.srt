00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:05,060
Given how important getting a location
is to getting good weather information,

00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,620
this is a lot harder than it should be.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,000
Typing, really?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,970
>> Yeah, it's not good.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,640
I mean, Dan tried to fix it a bit
with the whole validation stuff.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,800
But, I mean,

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,570
it's really obvious to me how there are
some ways you could make it even easier.

8
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,258
>> Okay, so why don't you go do them?

9
00:00:18,258 --> 00:00:22,580
>> Okay, calm down.

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,474
I got this.
