1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,795
So, why do we get such a small number for this calculation? Well, if you think

2
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:07,585
way back to when we did exponent notation at the beginning of the course, we

3
00:00:07,585 --> 00:00:12,472
talked about negative exponents and what they are. x to the negative 1 means 1

4
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:18,260
divided by x. x to the negative 2 means 1 over x squared. So if we multiply

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,548
something by x to the negative 1, we really want to divide that by x. And if we

6
00:00:23,548 --> 00:00:26,788
multiply something by x to the negative 2, we really want to divide it by x

7
00:00:26,788 --> 00:00:31,884
squared. So if we multiply something by 10 to the negative 4, what we really

8
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:36,907
want to do is divide it by 10 to the 4th. With multiplication by 10 to the

9
00:00:36,907 --> 00:00:41,870
positive 4, the answer we got was bigger than the number we started with. But,

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,192
when we divide by 10th to the 4, it gets smaller. For each factor of 10 we're

11
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:52,082
dividing by, the decimal point moves one step to the left. So, we start with

12
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:59,054
3.1, then 1 factor of 10 makes it 0.31 and we keep moving it. As before, we end

13
00:00:59,054 --> 00:01:04,244
up with these blank spots, we need to fill in zeros. Our decimal point is right

14
00:01:04,244 --> 00:01:09,192
here now. So what we actually have is, as we saw before, 0.00031. Now, note

15
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:16,149
that I put a 0 in front of our decimal point, to the left of it. Now this is

16
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:19,439
the technically correct way to write decimal numbers in general. If you miss

17
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,678
out on writing this, it's kind of like using slang for everyday speech. People

18
00:01:24,678 --> 00:01:29,012
will still know what you mean but its not quite as correct. Its not quite as

19
00:01:29,012 --> 00:01:32,974
proper in mathematics. So now that we've seen one example of using a negative

20
00:01:32,974 --> 00:01:37,368
exponent in scientific notation, I'm going to give you another one to try out.

21
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:42,933
Here is 3.1 times 10 to the negative 7. This time try without using a

22
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:47,099
calculator to write this in normal number notation.
