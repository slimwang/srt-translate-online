00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,140
Now that you've done a little
texture mapping, it's time for

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,990
a quick history quiz.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:09,241
It's okay if you don't know the answer,
just take a guess.

4
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:12,144
Who invented texture mapping?

5
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:15,724
Was it Ivan Sutherland,

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:20,670
Edwin Cavill, or Boytwong Fong?
