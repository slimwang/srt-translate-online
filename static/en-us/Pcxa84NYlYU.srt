1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:10,060
We have a count i that goes from 10 to 20. And, so we print 10, 11, 12, 13,

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:20,863
114, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. That now was ten numbers, and we print the 20, because

3
00:00:20,863 --> 00:00:28,245
over here there was a less than or equal sign. So we print a total of 11

4
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:32,479
numbers. It's the same as she has with the fencepost, one more number than one

5
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,830
might have expected. This is a common error, and people call it a fencepost

6
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,820
error. You don't want those fencepost errors, and here it the way to avoid

7
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,799
them.
