00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,410
So now we've found the balance after one year for Grant's account and the

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,778
balance after two years. What we're going to do now is something that we

3
00:00:07,778 --> 00:00:12,145
haven't really done in this course yet. I'm going to ask you to make a

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:16,652
hypothesis. This just means that you're going to come up with an idea and we'll

5
00:00:16,652 --> 00:00:22,073
see if it's right pretty soon. This is something that mathematicians do all the

6
00:00:22,073 --> 00:00:26,499
time. They look at examples, look for a pattern, guess what the pattern might

7
00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:32,625
mean, and then test their guess to see if it's right. If it's wrong, it's not a

8
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:37,943
big deal. They try again with a new guess. So the question I have for you is,

9
00:00:37,943 --> 00:00:43,648
what does the two here mean? Where does it come from, and what does it stand

10
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:50,224
for? Think about what might be going on, in general, with these equations. And

11
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:54,863
see if you can predict the pattern without working anything out. Write your

12
00:00:54,863 --> 00:00:59,389
guess in this box. Just so you know, this is not going to be graded.
