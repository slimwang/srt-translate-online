00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,730
Welcome to Udacity's Deep Learning
nano-degree foundation program.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,459
I'm Siraj.

3
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:05,059
>> And I'm Matt.

4
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:08,059
>> And we're both so excited that you're
joining us in the rapidly expanding

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,380
community of deep learning enthusiasts.

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,230
Deep Learning is driving the current
revolution in computing.

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,250
It's the secret sauce behind
everything from self-driving cars,

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,730
to language translation,
even generated art.

9
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:23,029
>> In 2016 alone, these technologies
have made things possible

10
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,140
that sound like science fiction,
but are in fact very, very real.

11
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,060
For example, Helping Faces is an app
developed in India that uses facial

12
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:33,129
recognition to find missing children.

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,789
Reuniting them with their families.

14
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:37,500
>> Deep Learning is
saving real human lives.

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,549
IBM is using it to browse millions of
genetic profiles in a way no single

16
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:45,669
human could, to classify genetic
disorders in patients accurately.

17
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,390
>> And you've probably used or
heard about Amazon's Alexa,

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,570
which uses Deep Learning to recognize,
interpret and act on human speech.

19
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,149
>> So basically, it's going down,
you should be hyped.

20
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,179
>> Just by being here today, you're
officially part of this revolution,

21
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:02,810
at the start of the journey that
can lead you amazing places.

22
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,849
Because Deep Learning is
the cornerstone of so

23
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:08,659
many game changing technologies,
you have limitless paths open to you.

24
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:10,340
>> We're pumped to see
what you wizards create.
