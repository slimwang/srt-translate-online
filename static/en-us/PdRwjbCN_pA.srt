1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:08,454
Now, in our callback, we drill down to get the GetUserData function. This will

2
00:00:08,454 --> 00:00:09,972
actually give us a pointer to the entity that created these physics bodies that

3
00:00:09,972 --> 00:00:11,568
are touching. Now from here, we start down a new magical rabbit hole. For each

4
00:00:11,568 --> 00:00:14,389
of the objects that are touching, we need to signal, that a collision has

5
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,421
occurred to it. We do this by calling a new function, called onTouch, and

6
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:22,910
passing it in the other physics body that it's touching. So you can see that

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,430
entity A gets an onTouch function called, passing in body B, and entity B gets

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,098
an on touch function called passing in bodyA. This set up allows each

9
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:35,124
individual entity to respond to collisions in their own way. So for instance,

10
00:00:35,124 --> 00:00:38,068
the onTouch of that for missile, would remove five health from the player it'

11
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:41,480
colliding with. Or if it's just hitting a wall, it may just decide to

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:48,939
self-destruct. But we haven't written this onTouch function yet. And in order

13
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:50,591
to do that, we need to hop all the way back to entity.js and add an onTouch

14
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:53,030
function. That allows other units to overload this function with custom logic

15
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,710
later. It's probably worth pointing out that you should be doing a whole series

16
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,746
of data checking to ensure that the information given to the post cell function

17
00:00:59,746 --> 00:01:04,540
is valid. So for example, whether or not body A and body B are valid objects or

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,750
simply null. And whether or not the points of proper entity types and have

19
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,860
onTouch functions. Now we'll let you graffle through all of these issues in the

20
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,938
future. But we figured, that we let you get a glimpse at the madness behind the

21
00:01:16,938 --> 00:01:20,688
mask. So, that means that anyone who defines a physics body should define an

22
00:01:20,688 --> 00:01:22,120
onTouch function.
