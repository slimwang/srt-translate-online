1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,980
Ready to have some fun?

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,450
This is a QR code app that
Paul Kinlan put together.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,560
You'll need a copy on
your local machine, so

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,910
check out the instructor notes for
download instructions.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,500
You can find it below.

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,110
It's a really cool app, but
right now it's a bit janky.

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,480
In this first quiz, you'll be replacing
setInterval with requestAnimationFrame.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,910
And in the second quiz you'll be
moving all the image decoding work off

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,460
the main thread and into a web worker.

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,020
Before you start working on the app,

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,450
you'll need to install gulp
if you don't already have it.

12
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,960
Once you install gulp, run npm install
to get all the dependencies, and

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,500
that will allow you to run gulp serve
to build and then serve the web site.

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,950
Gulp serve also watches all
your files for changes.

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,890
So if you save a change to
any of the JavaScript files,

16
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,590
it'll automatically rebuild and
refresh the page.

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,552
So for this quiz navigate to
app/scripts/main.js in your favorite

18
00:00:53,552 --> 00:00:57,950
text editor and
start using requestAnimationFrame.

19
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,380
Build and run the page with gulp serve
and you'll know you've done it properly.

20
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,360
When the app loads and you're seeing
animation frame fired in the timeline.

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,510
When you're done check this
box to let us know that you're

22
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,820
firing animation frames.
