00:00:00,783 --> 00:00:04,692
You're probably used to seeing
in writing the code here,

2
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:07,896
to create an object,
an array, and function.

3
00:00:07,896 --> 00:00:09,765
These are in the literal format.

4
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:12,974
These lines down here produce
the same end result, but

5
00:00:12,974 --> 00:00:14,870
are in the constructor format.

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,620
The constructor format for each of these
is not recommended for several reasons.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,547
It's not readable, it can be harder
to work with, and it's slower.

8
00:00:22,547 --> 00:00:26,913
But the constructor function does offer
one benefit over a function literal.

9
00:00:26,913 --> 00:00:30,036
It can dynamically create
a function at run time.

10
00:00:30,036 --> 00:00:33,452
Remember that underscores template
functions job is to construct

11
00:00:33,452 --> 00:00:34,124
a function.

12
00:00:34,124 --> 00:00:37,245
It does so by using
the constructor function format.

13
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:41,703
Here is a function that takes two
numbers and adds them together.

14
00:00:41,703 --> 00:00:43,980
It's written in the literal format.

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,018
This function does the same thing, but

16
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:48,376
it is written using
a constructor function.

17
00:00:48,376 --> 00:00:52,581
The last argument to a constructor
function is the body of the function.

18
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:57,201
Any arguments before the last one will
become parameters for the function.

19
00:00:57,201 --> 00:00:59,833
This makes constructor
functions really handy,

20
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:03,540
because they can create functions
with a dynamically supplied body.

21
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,335
So addr1 results in 3 and
addr2 gives us 7.

22
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:14,152
This make function accepts one argument
and returns a newly created function.

23
00:01:14,152 --> 00:01:17,577
I'll call make and
pass to it the string fun.

24
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,076
This returns a new function.

25
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:22,342
This is fun function is waiting
to be called with some data.

26
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:27,089
If I pass biking, I'll get the string
biking is fun returned to me.

27
00:01:27,089 --> 00:01:30,750
Passing in climbing, or
broccoli, makes them fun too.
