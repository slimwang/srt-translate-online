1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,410
All right.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,930
So here we are back at our eye again and

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,920
let's start talking about sort
of the most important part.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,690
This is the part of your eye,
the retina.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,190
It's the part of your
brain that is in your eye.

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,590
Now here is a picture
schematic of a retina, okay?

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,310
And first you'll notice there are these
receptors called rods and cones, and

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,500
we'll talk about those in a minute.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,340
And then those receptors
connect to these things called

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,160
horizontal bipolar cells, which take
the chemical output of the receptors and

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,080
eventually turn them into stimulation
for these ganglion cells,

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,210
which are the first proper nerves, these
are the nerves that actually produce

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,980
firing spikes that we're used to for
nerve cells.

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,720
But when you look at this,
you should look at that curvature, and

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,070
it should bother you a little bit,
right?

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,960
So here's the picture of my eye, okay.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,370
But you see of course my thing is,
is bent this way.

18
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,520
And this thing is sort of bent that way.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,360
So actually what I need to do is, and

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,610
I'm really proud of this,
is we need to rotate that picture.

21
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,190
So this curvature here is
like this curvature there.

22
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:16,328
At which point you realize what
comes up this way, the light.

23
00:01:16,328 --> 00:01:18,300
All right?

24
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,250
The human system has what's referred
to as an inverted retina, okay?

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:30,560
And that is the light comes in,
and passes through, all this gunk.

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,830
It passes through,
there are blood vessels in here,

27
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,430
there's nerves,
it passes right through them.

28
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,880
Then it hits your photo receptors, okay,

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,450
and then any stray light keeps going,
sort of gets absorbed.

30
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,450
This background layer,
this is called the pigment epithelium.

31
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,360
This is actually a very black
pigment in the back of your eye.

32
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,380
So, you might ask,
why would you build an inverted retina?

33
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,240
>> Why would you build
an inverted retina?

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,050
>> Nobody asked me, but
here's some, some speculation.

35
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,460
There are a couple of things.

36
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,690
The, the reason that,
that I like best is.

37
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,370
What happens is, is that the light goes
through here and anyone that happens to

38
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,900
hit the photoreceptors,
right there, gets absorbed.

39
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,590
And then after that,
it hits this pigment epithelium.

40
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,985
Okay, and what that means is
the pigment epithelium absorbs

41
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:24,215
any stray light, so it eliminates
scatter within the, within the eye.

42
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:28,845
And that gives you
a very sharp resolution.

43
00:02:28,845 --> 00:02:31,415
It reduces your ability to
see at night a little bit.

44
00:02:31,415 --> 00:02:34,110
We'll talk about the sensitivity
of rods and cones in a little bit.

45
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,840
But it gives you this, this idea
that you know, first the, the light,

46
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,920
whatever light gets absorbed by
the detectors goes into processing and

47
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,900
everything else is absorbed and removed.

48
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,770
It doesn't cause any disturbance.

49
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,250
It does mean that there's a funny
sort of thing that goes on.

50
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,300
These structures produce a very, they're
clear because they're made out of you

51
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,500
know, gelatinous stuff
that is biological tissue.

52
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,690
But of course it causes little shadows,
right.

53
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,330
So if you go right
past the blood vessel,

54
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,360
it'd be actually a little
bit of a shadow.

55
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,840
So you might ask,
why don't we see these shadows.

56
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,610
>> Why don't we see these shadows?

57
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,840
>> The human eyeball is remarkable.

58
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,180
Anything that's perfectly stabilized
on your eye, the brain just removes.

59
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:14,710
Okay?
So

60
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,450
that shadow stays exactly in
the same place on the retina.

61
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,650
The brain just removes it.

62
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,010
In fact, there are some cool tricks
you can do by building little sta,

63
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,260
stabilization systems that will keep
something projected exactly the same

64
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,530
place on the eye and
eventually you just don't see it.

65
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,540
So, anyway, so
that's the inverted retina of the eye
