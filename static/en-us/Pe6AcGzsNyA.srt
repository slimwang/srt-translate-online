1
00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:03,640
Okay, so now we have a better
understanding of the main activity.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,130
Remember that you can think of
an activity as a single screener or app.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,610
By lesson five, we'll find out
that this isn't necessarily true.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,370
But for now this simplification is fine.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,393
In most apps you've built this far,
your app has had a single activity.

6
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:21,453
Near the end of the Just Java app,
you added code that sent an intent to

7
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:25,037
an email app to send an email
out with a coffee order summary.

8
00:00:25,037 --> 00:00:28,104
And then the Miwok App will
also be sending intents, but

9
00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:32,250
this time we're not launching into
other apps on Android device.

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,310
Instead, we're sending intents to open
other activities that are created

11
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,730
within our Miwok App.

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,780
So we should have five activities
in our app, the main activity

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,640
as well as an activity for
each of the four categories of words.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,260
When we click on a category
in the main activity,

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,960
we'll send an intent to
open a new activity.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,940
That will eventually contain a list
of Miwok phrases for that category.

17
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,380
To start off with,
all activities will be empty.

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,540
But this activity will eventually
show the list of number words, and

19
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,200
this activity will show the list
of family member words and

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,820
etc., for colors and phrases.

21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,730
So let's work on creating these
four other activities in our app.

22
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,700
I'll walk you through how to create
a new activity in Android Studio.

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,960
Right-click on the package
in the project directory,

24
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,328
go to New &gt; Activity &gt; Empty Activity.

25
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:19,818
When the wizard pops up,
give the activity a name.

26
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:22,442
In this case,
we will use NumbersActivity, and

27
00:01:22,442 --> 00:01:24,950
accept the default and click Finish.

28
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,460
Now it's your turn to
create activities for

29
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,960
the remaining categories, phrases,
colors and family members.

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,890
If you run the app on your device
there should be no errors.

31
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,610
However, you won't be able to click
the category buttons to open these

32
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,870
activities until we add
more code in the next step.

33
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,380
After you create each new activity,
navigate to the AndroidManifest.xml file

34
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,440
under the App Manifest folder
to observe how it's changed.

35
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,830
Now, to recap what your tasks are,
first,

36
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,585
I'd like you to create the four
new activities in the Miwok app.

37
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:55,240
So that would be the phrase activity,

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,440
the numbers activity, the family
activity and the colors activity.

39
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,750
And then next, go ahead and

40
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,870
navigate to the AndroidManifest.xml
file and then answer this question.

41
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,630
So how does the AndroidManifest.xml file

42
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,180
change as you add more
activities to the app?

43
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,330
Now, I know this is a new file
that you haven't seen before, but

44
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,280
try to make an educated guess by
checking out the visual changes

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,750
that you see in that file, and
go ahead and write your answers here.
