1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,590
So far you've covered supervised and
unsupervised learning.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,478
There's a third major school of
thought in machine learning,

3
00:00:05,478 --> 00:00:06,740
called reinforcement learning.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,150
Reinforcement learning is inspired
in part by the behaviorist school of

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,080
thought in psychology.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,110
And it's a way of tweaking our
system to prefer being right or

7
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,840
wrong in certain ways.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,180
And so a good way to think about this is
with an example, think of a smart cab,

9
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,530
a self driving car.

10
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,230
It's learning how to navigate roads,
it's learning how to transport its

11
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,410
passengers and it knows that there's
different ways it can get optimal.

12
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,070
It can be optimal if it gets there
in the shortest amount of time.

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,130
It can also be optimal if it
gets there without crashing.

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,842
But really we would want it to
prefer one of those definitions of

15
00:00:34,842 --> 00:00:37,140
the optimality way above the other one.

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,215
We would much prefer it get there
much later than it would otherwise,

17
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:42,294
than to actually get in
an accident on the way.

18
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:44,881
We really want it to prefer
not getting in an accident,

19
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:47,640
to just getting there
as fast as possible.

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,980
So, reinforcement learning would
be a way of teaching the system to

21
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,550
prioritize in that way.

22
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,623
We attach rewards and
punishments to different outcomes.

23
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:58,181
And by weighting those rewards and
punishments in the right way,

24
00:00:58,181 --> 00:01:01,040
we can teach at the right level of
priority to assign to different goals.

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,700
So in this case,

26
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,150
we would assign a much bigger
punishment to getting an accident,

27
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,070
to just being a couple of minutes later
than they could have been otherwise.

28
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,020
So in this unit, we'll talk about
reinforcement learning, and

29
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,730
how augmenting the machine learning
process with these rewards and

30
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,570
punishments, can really
fundamentally change the system's

31
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,620
understanding that we generate.
