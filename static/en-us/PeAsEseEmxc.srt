1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,254
Now its time to apply
what you've learned.

2
00:00:02,254 --> 00:00:04,839
We are going to add some
networking to Sunshine.

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:10,210
Open project SO2.01-Exercise-Networking.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,898
Look at your to-do's.

5
00:00:11,897 --> 00:00:14,059
First fill in network details,

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,210
you can use the technique we
used in the toy app if you wish.

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,550
Delete the dummy data-related code.

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,150
Then create a FetchWeatherTask to
perform those networks across some

9
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:24,750
background threat.

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,519
Override the doInBackground and
onPostExecute methods to get and

11
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,274
display the weather results.

12
00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:34,854
Override the doInBackground
an onPostExecute methods to get and

13
00:00:34,854 --> 00:00:37,024
display the weather results.

14
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:40,989
Create a loadWeatherData function to
get the preferred weather location from

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,760
SunshinePreferences and
then call it from onCreate.
