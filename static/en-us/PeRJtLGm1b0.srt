1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,960
Now let's move on to
stochastic environments.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,740
Let's consider a robot that
has slippery wheels, so

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,359
that sometimes when you make a movement,
a left or

4
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:12,349
a right action, the wheels slip and
you stay in the same location.

5
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:16,480
And sometimes they work and
you arrive where you expected to go.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,990
And let's assume that the suck
action always works perfectly.

7
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:22,949
Now, we get a belief state space
that looks something like this.

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,349
And, notice that the results of actions

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,679
will often result in a belief state
that's larger than it was before.

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,219
That is, the action will increase
uncertainty because we don't know

11
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:35,629
what the result of
the action's going to be.

12
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,609
And so here, for
each of the individual world states

13
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:43,119
belonging to a belief state, we have
multiple outcomes for the action.

14
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,709
And that's what stochastic means.

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,750
And so we end up with
a larger belief state here.

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,240
But in terms of the observation,

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,000
the same thing holds as in
the deterministic world.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,179
The observation partitions the belief
state into smaller belief states.

19
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:02,584
So, in a stochastic partially
observable environment,

20
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:05,361
the actions tend to
increase uncertainty, and

21
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:08,911
the observations tend to bring
that uncertainty back down.

22
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:12,340
Now, how would we do planning
in this type of an environment?

23
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,454
Well, I haven't told you yet, so
you won't know the answer for sure.

24
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:17,469
But I want you to try to
figure it out anyways,

25
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:19,230
even if you might get the answer wrong.

26
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:24,165
So, imagine I had the whole belief state
from which I've diagrammed just a little

27
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:24,819
bit here.

28
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:29,533
And I wanted to know how to get from
this belief state to one in which all

29
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:30,930
squares are clean.

30
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,449
So I'm going to give you
some possible plans, and

31
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:40,420
I want you to tell me whether you think
each of these plans will always work,

32
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,590
maybe sometimes work depending on
how the stochasticity works out.

33
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,799
And so here are the possible plans,
remember I'm starting here, and I want

34
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,959
to know how to get to a belief state
in which all the squares are clean.

35
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,000
One possibility is suck right,
then suck.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,549
One is right suck, left suck.

37
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,549
One is suck right, right suck.

38
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:14,210
And the other is suck right,
suck right, suck.

39
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,129
So some of these actions might take you
out of this little belief state here.

40
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:23,280
But just use what you knew from the
previous definition of the state space

41
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,400
and the results of
each of those actions.

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,879
And the fact that the right and
left actions are non-deterministic.

43
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,889
And tell me which of these you
think will always achieve the goal.

44
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,069
Or will maybe achieve the goal.

45
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:41,449
And then I want you to also answer for
the fill in the blank plan.

46
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,129
That is, is there some plan,
some ideal plan, which always or

47
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:48,180
maybe achieves the goal?
