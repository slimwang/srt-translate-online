1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,520
When you first have an idea for
a game, it's often pretty complex.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,410
You might imagine a story with lots of
interesting graphics and enemies, but

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,220
the core of the game is
usually very simple.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,930
And this core is the first
thing you want to test out

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,030
before you distribute your
game to a wider audience.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,140
You want to make sure your
game foundation is strong,

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,690
by testing it out with
a small group of players.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,580
To test your game core, you need
to create a minimum viable product

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,280
which is the simplest most
focused version of your game.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,330
Minimum means it contains
the minimum amount of features

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,720
that encapsulate the game,
no extra levels or graphics.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,790
Let's look at some a examples
of a minimum viable product.

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,580
Consider the game Megatroid which is a
platformer a game where you jump through

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,070
stages, getting upgrades and shooting
robot enemies to advance levels.

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,460
You can even generate
your own playable levels.

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,750
This game has a lot of fun features, but

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,530
what do we need in
the minimum viable product?

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,660
Level creation?

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,710
No.

20
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,690
Enemies?

21
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,880
No.

22
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,450
Weapon upgrades, or even weapons at all?

23
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,250
No.

24
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,620
These are all extra features that
can be added later in the game.

25
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,600
To test the foundation of the game,
we need to remove all the enemies,

26
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,960
items and extra levels,
all the things that are nice to have but

27
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,590
not necessary to have.

28
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,940
And what we're left with is
a single jumping platform game.

29
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,660
To make a Megatroid
minimum viable product, I

30
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,890
would include just a single level where
I can move and jump and fall into pits.

31
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,860
I might also include an easy restart for
the game.

32
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,120
This defines the basic
structure of my game.

33
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,570
These are the minimum needed features,
and

34
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,740
they're the most important to perfect.

35
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,500
We want to test this version out and

36
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,640
make sure that the game movement is as
smooth and high quality as possible.

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,890
Then we can add enemies and
upgrades later on.

38
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,720
So when you're thinking about what to
include in your minimum viable product,

39
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,050
think about what features are needed for
your game to be entertaining and

40
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,910
what can be added later.
