As a conclusion, I hope you all agree that programming is fun.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So often it's more fun to write a program code to implement things like union

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
rather than finding a built-in way to do this, but it did mean that if we want to improve

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
as programmers, we need to learn new things and the way to do that is try solving problems.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But as you solve problems to learn the things that are useful to solve those problems on the way.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And a great way to do that is to try to build things using the tools that you have already

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and then to look for new tools that would make that more easy.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
In this unit, we saw a simple example of that whereby knowing about list

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
you could learn about sets that have different properties and make it much easier

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
to implement things like union because that's a built-in operation for sets.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So as a challenge, I want to encourage to try to learn more new things about Python

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and one way to do that would be to make the search engine code shorter to figure out ways

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to do things that we had to write a lot of code for by using built-in parts of Python.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
There are lots and lots of opportunities for doing this with the provided search engine code.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Thanks for your attention, and I look forward to seeing you're much improved code in the forums.
