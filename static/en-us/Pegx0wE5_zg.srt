00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,075
All right. You're all done. Let's go

2
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:06,450
over the solution to bulkInserts with the ContentProvider.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,710
While we cannot insert a vector directly, we can easily convert a vector into

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,097
an array. Once we've done this, the

5
00:00:15,097 --> 00:00:18,450
the bulkInsert method will insert very efficiently. Now,

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,100
our backend will update efficiently. But we

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,620
really need a way to update the front

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,770
end without introducing framerate jitter. Fortunately, Android

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,040
offers a pattern for that known as Loaders.
