1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,569
All right, you're done.

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:03,280
You are over the hurdle.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,110
This is the hardest thing we're going
to teach in this entire class, I think,

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,190
in a lot of ways, or
at least the most involved.

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,790
Let me show you what my
solution looked like.

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,329
So we talked a lot about what was
going to happen in ForecastAdapter.

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,370
This is where most of the code for
this one actually was,

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,720
it was in ForecastAdapter still.

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,100
So the first thing we did is we
created a member variable for

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,122
this ForecastAdapter onClick handler.

11
00:00:28,122 --> 00:00:31,240
This onClick handler's one that was
designed for our specific use case,

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,550
it's not just a duplicate of
the framework's onClick handlers,

13
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,000
because it actually
returns a view holder.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,780
And as well as we're destroying this
empty view construct, so that we can

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:46,390
have a view that we can alter
depending on how many items we have.

16
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,230
Then we have our view holder implement
view.OnClickListener, which is very,

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,470
very important.

18
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,490
Then, as I said before, when we create
the view holder in the constructor,

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,440
we can set an OnClickListener.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,320
So here's what we're actually
going to do on this onClick handler.

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,010
because this is kind of important.

22
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,822
We're actually going to get the date,
which is what we need to do actually,

23
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:08,890
use onClick.

24
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,030
And then we're going to send that
blissfully away into our click handler,

25
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,300
which is a lot nicer than
actually sending the cursor in.

26
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,429
This is a nice data abstraction
thing we're doing here.

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,320
And as you can see,
here's the interface we created for

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,330
that OnClickHandler, which is going to
return a date along with our ViewHolder.

29
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,410
And as you can see in our constructor
now, we're actually taking

30
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:34,480
the OnClickHandler and the emptyView,
and in fact, those are both final.

31
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,540
So if we didn’t construct them here,
we could not survive as a class.

32
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,090
So one more change we do here is that
in swapCursor, we have a cursor.

33
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,720
We can check to see what
the item count is, and

34
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,080
make ourselves visible or invisible.

35
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,610
Very nice to have that now
that we have an empty view.

36
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,961
So that’s most of the work for
this, actually.

37
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:59,759
But there's a little bit to do
in ForecastFragment as well.

38
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,800
So again, we already had
our empty view here before.

39
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,604
Now what we're going to do is
we're going to pass that into our

40
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:11,144
ForecastAdapter as well as create
now a ForecastAdapter OnClickHandler

41
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:13,455
that gets a date and our ViewHolder.

42
00:02:13,455 --> 00:02:16,175
And the reason why we're getting the
ViewHolder is actually because I want

43
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:17,165
the adapter position.

44
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,425
So I could've just sent
the position back, but

45
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:22,160
it was kind of nice to have that there.

46
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,590
And so that'll make onClick work again.

47
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,220
Yeah, so that's it.

48
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,380
We didn't have to do much
at all in ForecastFragment.

49
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,950
So that's it for
this using RecyclerView part two.

50
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,275
You guys are over the hump
now with RecyclerView.

51
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:36,590
You're feeling confident that you can
use this in your programs, hopefully.

52
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,950
And, let's get on to the next.
