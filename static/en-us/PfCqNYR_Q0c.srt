1
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:08,199
So that's how variable elimination works. It's a continued process of joining together factors to form a larger factor,

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,399
and then eliminating variables by summing out.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,499
If we make a good choice of the order in which we apply these operations,

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:21,267
then variable elimination can be much more efficient than just doing the whole enumeration.
