1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,029
That's the case in general.

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:08,940
If you have N inputs, and K outputs,
you have (N+1)K parameters to use.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,010
Not one more.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:15,050
The thing is, you might want to use
many, many more parameters in practice.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,770
Also, it's linear.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,310
This means that the kind of interactions
that you're capable of representing with

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,500
that model is somewhat limited.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,100
For example, if two inputs
interact in an additive way,

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,950
your model can represent them
well as a matrix multiply.

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,090
But if two inputs interact in the way
that the outcome depends on the product

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:34,720
of the two for

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,260
example, you won't be able to model
that efficiently with a linear model.

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,790
Linear operations
are really nice though.

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,920
Big matrix multiplies are exactly
what GPUs were designed for.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,260
They're relatively cheap and
very, very fast.

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,060
Numerically linear
operations are very stable.

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,100
We can show mathematically that
small changes in the input

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,560
can never yield big
changes in the output.

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,630
The derivates are very nice too.

20
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,680
The derivative of a linear
function is constant.

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,070
You can't get more stable
numerically than a constant.

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,040
So, we would like to keep our parameters
inside big linear functions, but

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,510
we would also want the entire
model to be nonlinear.

24
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,510
We can't just keep multiplying
our inputs by linear functions,

25
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,060
because that's just equivalent
to one big linear function.

26
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,395
So, we're going to have to
introduce non-linearities.
