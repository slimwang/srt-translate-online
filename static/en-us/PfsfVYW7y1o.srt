1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,190
Now it's your turn.

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:03,790
Let's do a quiz on write-back caches.

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,990
Suppose we have a direct map cache and
this is one entering that cache.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,960
And all of the axises we will
do will map to that one entry.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,932
The valid bit starts out at 0.

6
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:15,859
The dirty bit starts out at 1.

7
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:18,914
And the tag starts out at A.

8
00:00:18,914 --> 00:00:23,330
The processor does the following
sequence of axises.

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:28,280
It reads A, reads B, writes B,
reads C, reads D, writes D.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:35,320
And all of these, A, B, C, and D,
map to the same place in the cache.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,070
The question for

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,960
you, is, after these accesses,
what is the new state of the cache?

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,620
Also you need to determine how many
cache misses do we have in this sequence

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,930
of accesses and how many write-backs to
memory will happen during the sequence.
