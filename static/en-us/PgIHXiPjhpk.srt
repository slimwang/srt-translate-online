1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,020
All right.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,980
It's time for you to start applying
the layout skills you just learned.

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,190
And here's what it
looks like on desktop.

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:06,960
Not that great.

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,060
I think you can do a lot better.

6
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,190
For this part in the project, pick a set
of breakpoints that you think look good.

7
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,660
And then, use one of the patterns that
you just learned, to style the page, so

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,840
it looks great,
even on desktop and tablet.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,610
If you didn't finish the exercise from
the last time you worked on the project.

10
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,750
Don't worry.
You can grab a working copy,

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,020
linked in the instructor notes below.

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,110
Make sure that you test on phones,
tablets, and browser windows of all

13
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,960
different sizes, so that you get a sense
of what the page looks like everywhere.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,240
Adjust your breakpoints, until you
get something that you're happy with.

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,020
And remember what might work on one
phone, might not work so well on others.

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,400
And of course, if you can, make sure
that you test on real devices as well,

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,710
because sometimes you'll
uncover unexpected behavior or

18
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,770
design elements that, well, you just
didn't expect, I'm going to show you

19
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,820
what we came up with but
this is by no means the right answer.

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,560
This is just what we like and you could
totally go in a different direction.

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,530
And if you're happy with it,
then that's great.

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,390
But this is what we did.

23
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,940
We've got a breakpoint here, and
then another breakpoint there.

24
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,780
The important part of this part of
the project is that you try out

25
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,040
different layout patterns,
and find out what you like.

26
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:20,590
Good luck.
