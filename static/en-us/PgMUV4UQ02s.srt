1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,242
Remember that square root signs are the same as exponents of 1 half. So, you

2
00:00:04,242 --> 00:00:08,458
need to take the entire quantity 2x plus 4 place it in parenthesis and then,

3
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:12,810
just outside the parenthesis put a power of 1 over 2, and we didn't do anything

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,872
to change the right hand side of the equation at all.
