00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,792
Now we run into an interesting concept. Is that we'd like to have our robots

2
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:07,459
move around the screen, which presents a problem. Currently our canvas

3
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:11,304
coordinates are the same as our map coordinates. Such that tiles 00 on the map

4
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:15,269
renders to location 00 on the canvas, but as our robot moves around We want them

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,242
to stay at the center of the screen and background move around accordingly. In

6
00:00:19,242 --> 00:00:23,070
order to properly translate to canvas we have to separate those two coordinate

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,504
systems. Such that we can map the translated world value to the canvas

8
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:30,672
coordinates to accurately draw. Your goal, if you choose to accept it, is to

9
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:35,316
write a function that will translate the map to center around a given x, y pair.

10
00:00:35,316 --> 00:00:39,848
For instance, if we call center at 00, then the top left corner of the map 00,

11
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:44,549
should render at the center of the canvas. Center is 256 by 256. Should put the

12
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:48,875
map coordinates of 256, 256. In the world space at the center of the canvas.

13
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:52,977
Now, write a function that will translate the map to center around a given x, y

14
00:00:52,977 --> 00:00:57,219
pair. For instance, if we call center at 00 then the top left corner of the map

15
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:01,336
00, should render at the center of the canvas. Center at 256 by 256 should do

16
00:01:01,336 --> 00:01:05,304
the corollary thing, placing coordinates of 256, 256 in world space at the

17
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:09,531
center of the canvas. Now, notice you'll actually need to know the canvas width

18
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:13,500
and canvas height when computing this data so you know where is the center of

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,238
the canvas.
