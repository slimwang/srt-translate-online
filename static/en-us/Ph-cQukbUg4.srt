00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The very first question, is a search question.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You probably know about the Towers of Hanoi,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
if you don't then please go and Google them.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's a single player game, by which you try to move the tower of four slices over here,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
onto the right peg, over here.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You can use the middle peg, but the rules are you can only move one disk at a time.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And it might never happen, that a small disk sits below a larger disk.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So the way to solve it is to move the disk over here,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the second largest disk to the right side,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the small one over,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and the third largest to the center, and so on.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If you know it, you know what I'm talking about. If not, just Google it.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So, I would like to know,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
what is the size of the state space of valid disk configurations in this puzzle.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Please enter this here.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'd like to know, whether the number of the disks on the left peg

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
are an admissible heuristic, if you use A* search.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And I'd like to know, what is the number of steps

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
that an optimal solution will require

20
00:01:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to move all the disks from the left peg, to the right peg.
