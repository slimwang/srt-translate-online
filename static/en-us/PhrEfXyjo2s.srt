1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,888
We can find these points by looking at the curve of the function above the line

2
00:00:03,888 --> 00:00:08,972
y equals 0. And look at this, the boundaries of those intervals are here at x

3
00:00:08,972 --> 00:00:14,674
equals 3 halves, where the graph is intersecting y equals 0. And here at the

4
00:00:14,674 --> 00:00:19,445
vertical asymptotes of x equals 5, those were our critical values. All the x

5
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:22,910
coordinates of this part of the function and all of the x coordinates of this

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,219
part of the function will satisfy our inequality. Awesome.
