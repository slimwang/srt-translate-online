1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,510
This table is about individual
animals that live at a particular zoo.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,400
The first row says that the zoo
has a gorilla named Max,

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,260
who was born on April 13th of 2001.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,780
That's three pieces of data
that are all related, and

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,180
that there all about the same gorilla.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,430
Every row has three pieces of
data fitting the same pattern.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,370
Notice that it's totally possible for
two animals to have the same name.

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,150
Max the gorilla isn't the same
animal as Max the moose.

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,670
When we create a table in a database,
we'll give the table a name.

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,770
This one's named animals.

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,720
The name of the table and the names and

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,550
types of the columns,
make up what's called the table header.

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,300
These aren't values in the table,

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,280
they just tell us what
the data in the table means.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,490
The body of the table consists
of any number of rows, and

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,380
each row contains a value for
each column.

17
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,600
Let's see a little more of the table and
do a bit of a quiz.
