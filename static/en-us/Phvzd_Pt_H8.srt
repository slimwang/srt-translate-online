In this session we're going to take a look at shadows. This is a little

2
00:00:03,221 --> 00:00:07,854
environment i built and it's being lit by a directional light. When doing

3
00:00:07,854 --> 00:00:11,550
trivial graphics rendering, which I'm doing here, shadowing is typically not

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,575
supported. For instance we can see that light leaks in under the little roof in

5
00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:23,672
the back of the scene. so let's lay a little shadowing. Now we can see that the

6
00:00:23,672 --> 00:00:28,579
scene is being properly shadowed. Parts of the environment that were previously

7
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:32,580
incorrectly lit are now dark. This happens because we are now disabling light

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,400
if there is something between the light source and the geometry. By rotating

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,440
the light, we can also place the shadow where we want it. But there is still

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,034
something wrong with the shadows. View live shadows are typically not as sharp

11
00:00:45,034 --> 00:00:54,132
as what we see here. Now we have enabled soft shadows. This looks much more

12
00:00:54,132 --> 00:00:58,314
realistic. Perfectly sharp shadows come from assuming the light sources

13
00:00:58,314 --> 00:01:03,220
infinite this small. In real life, light sources have size. And by taking it in

14
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,874
consideration, we get a soft shadow border. This shadow border separates the

15
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:12,566
shadow into two parts. We call the completely shadowed area the umbra. And the

16
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:17,390
soft part with the gradient the penumbra. The penumbra happens in regions of

17
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:22,244
the surface where the light source is being partially occluded. Also note how

18
00:01:22,244 --> 00:01:25,592
the penumbra has been small when the lit point is close to the occluder, and

19
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:32,004
large when it's farther away. This wraps up the part about shadowing. Thanks
