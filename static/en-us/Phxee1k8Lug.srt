This graph represents y equal to negative x to the third. Just like in the

00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:07,401
previous quiz with the parabola, changing the sign in the leading coefficient

00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:11,673
simply flips the graph upside down. Note that for y equals x cubed, like we

00:00:11,673 --> 00:00:15,650
said before, the graph is starting way down low on the left and reaching up way

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,605
high to the right. Since y equals negative x cubed is going to have all the

6
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:24,448
opposite function values that y equals x cubed has, it starts really high on

00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:29,190
the left and reaches way down low on the right.
