00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,210
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,570
This is going to be the second in a series about stereo.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,550
In particular, we're going to focus on what's called epipolar geometry.

4
00:00:09,745 --> 00:00:12,500
We'd said last time that if we had two images and

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,840
we knew something about the cameras, if we could find correspondences given that

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,280
known relationship, we could find the depth.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,490
And we talked about disparity.

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,080
And disparity was the idea that the location of a point in an image would

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,020
change, depending upon the depth of the scene as I move my camera.

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,840
And if I actually had the disparity I could make a disparity map,

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,410
which tells me how all the points have shifted.

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,560
And disparity was inversely proportional to the depth, and

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,990
that's was this disparity map on the right is.

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,710
But, how do we find the disparity?

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,870
Essentially given one point in the image, we need to search for it in the other.

16
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,710
But our intuition tells us, if I know something about how the two

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:01,300
cameras are aligned, you give me one point in the picture on the left.

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,519
It can't be anywhere on the picture on the right,

19
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,360
it has to be somehow constrained in terms of where it can be on the left.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,900
This lesson is going to be about those constraints, and

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,870
then we're going to assume those constraints when we go about actually finding

22
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,340
the points in the next lesson.
