1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,368
This would be the keystrokes to enter this third expression, and these would be

2
00:00:03,368 --> 00:00:07,806
the keystrokes to enter this last expression. We can start entering this

3
00:00:07,806 --> 00:00:13,172
expression by typing in a fraction bar, that's the forward slash. It'll create

4
00:00:13,172 --> 00:00:16,988
a spot for a numerator and a denominator. After we type in the numerator, we

5
00:00:16,988 --> 00:00:20,348
want to hit the right arrow key twice to move the cursor from the exponent

6
00:00:20,348 --> 00:00:25,636
position down to the denominator. Then, we enter in our denominator using what

7
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:29,598
we know about the square root. After we enter this under this underneath our

8
00:00:29,598 --> 00:00:32,404
radical, our cursor will appear here and we need to hit our right arrow key

9
00:00:32,404 --> 00:00:38,280
twice to move back to the main line. Then, we just type in negative 4. For this

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,373
last expression, we just want to be careful with the parentheses. If we start

11
00:00:42,373 --> 00:00:46,210
with an open parenthesis, another one is automatically created on the other

12
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,193
side. So, notice that when I get to the 5, I don't need to type in another

13
00:00:50,193 --> 00:00:53,556
parenthesis, I just the right arrow key and the carrot key and a 2 for the

14
00:00:53,556 --> 00:00:58,876
exponent. If you got all of these correct, you're really becoming a Math Quill

15
00:00:58,876 --> 00:00:59,763
pro.
