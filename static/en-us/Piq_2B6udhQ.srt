00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's ask you a different question--suppose we're on the fields and we learn how to throw ball.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
On average, we're able to throw it 30 m, but because there's randomness in the ball,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
we have a standard deviation of 5 m.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And now we trained, we improved our performance by 10%.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We didn't just step forward by 2 more meters before we throw

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and that gives us an additional improvement of 2 m.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
For Gaussian outcome like this, how does it affect all µ' and σ'

8
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
after both of these improvements are materialized.
