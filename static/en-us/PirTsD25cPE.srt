We already know that, in general, the slope of a line is the increase in y for

2
00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:10,496
every increase in x. So, the change in y here is going to be d minus b, and the

3
00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:15,462
change in x is going to be c minus a. So that is a general answer for how to

4
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:18,638
find the slope of a line between any two points.
