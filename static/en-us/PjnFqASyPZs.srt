1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,820
So let's learn about classification.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,010
Here is the plan.

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,119
I'm going to tell you just enough, so
that you can put together a very simple,

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,230
but very important type of classifier,
called the logistic classifier.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,850
With that, you'll be able to run through
the first assignment which will have you

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,260
download and pre-process some images for
classification.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,630
And then run an actual logistic
classifier on that data.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,190
Once you've connected the bit of math
that's coming up and the code in

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,950
that first assignment, everything else
will just be building up from there.

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,220
We will be building together all of 
deeplearning on top of this piece,

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:35,820
block by block.
