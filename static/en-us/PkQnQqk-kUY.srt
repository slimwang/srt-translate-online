00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,475
Now it's your turn to add code to your
app to track when users do something.

2
00:00:06,244 --> 00:00:09,331
So add code to your app to
track the remove meal event, or

3
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:11,510
you can choose your own event to track.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,550
Then you're going to need to
run the app on your device.

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,990
Make sure it's connected to
android studio, and use the app.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,780
And in particular,

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,870
make sure that you do the event that's
going to fire the event hit code.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,040
You can look in the logs to see the
event being sent to the analytic service

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,670
for dispatching.

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,110
Then you need to review the events
in the Analytics dashboard.

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,640
It's a good idea to keep an eye on
the real time data because then you'll

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,090
see the hits showing up fairly soon
after you actually send the event.

13
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,790
And it's nice to have that feedback
just in case it takes a while for

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,980
the data to percolate to
the rest of the dashboard.

15
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,830
Then think about what events you
might really want to track in this

16
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,200
particular app.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,090
Is it helpful just to record
what dinners people don't like?

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,790
Go ahead and discuss it in the forum.
