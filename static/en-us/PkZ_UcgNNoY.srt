1
00:00:00,282 --> 00:00:00,850
All right, Charles, so

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:05,030
what did we learn on this extended
unit on convergence related stuff.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,890
>> Well, I think the first thing
we learned was Convergence.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,650
Convergence is a thing and

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,440
it's something that we would like to be
able to prove in our other algorithms,

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,219
and we can in fact prove
them from other algorithms.

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,410
>> Like what?

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,190
>> That for
example Q-learning actually converges.

9
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,810
It doesn't just converge to something,
it converges to Q star.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,750
>> Oh yeah, that's pretty good.

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,760
Now we did that in the form of
a generalized theorem that broke

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,500
the Q-learning rule down into actually
kind of two little sub-update rules.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,350
And the proof basically says,
well if both of the sub-update rules do

14
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,950
the right thing, then the overall
update rule does the right thing.

15
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,620
And that got us
the Q-learning converges.

16
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,350
And as you said, not just converges, but
converges to the optimal Q function for

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,190
the corresponding MDP,

18
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,610
which actually is pretty amazing
when you think about it, right?

19
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,870
We have all these algorithms for
solving MDP's and

20
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,870
Q learning is like one line
of code that just says,

21
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,280
whenever you make a transition,
do a little update like this, and

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,460
nonetheless, that actually works
in the limit it computes Q star.

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,050
It's almost too simple
not to try Q learning.

24
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,921
>> Right, but it's generally the case
that simplicity is often the right

25
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:19,235
thing to do we call that elegance.

26
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:21,869
>> Ooh, nicely said.

27
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:23,680
>> What else have we learned?

28
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,300
I learned some other
words like nonexpansive.

29
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,110
>> Or even better, contraction.

30
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,153
>> I do not like that word.

31
00:01:33,153 --> 00:01:35,080
>> Really?

32
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,707
>> It makes you uncomfortable.

33
00:01:35,707 --> 00:01:39,768
>> [LAUGHS] Okay, so
the last thing that I remember is

34
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:44,655
talking about is speaking of
generalized, generalized MDPs.

35
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:48,001
>> Right, generalized MDPs have
these nice structure that as long as

36
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:50,987
the operators that are inside
of it that are doing updates or

37
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:54,229
non-expansions then we get these
other kinds of convergence.

38
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:56,566
We get the convergence
of value iteration.

39
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:58,609
We get the convergence of Q learning.

40
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:02,395
So, we can actually combine these
generalized MDPs with the generalized

41
00:02:02,395 --> 00:02:04,176
convergence theorem and kaboom.

42
00:02:04,176 --> 00:02:04,717
>> Yeah.
And

43
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:07,973
that's actually pretty cool because it
would allow us to think about different

44
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:09,245
kinds of decision processes.

45
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:11,307
Different situations we
want it to be in and

46
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:14,818
we would know that all the math would
go through and so we could just do it.

47
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:18,463
All we have to do is worry about
whether they're non-expansive or not.

48
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:19,183
>> Great!

49
00:02:19,183 --> 00:02:21,472
Exactly and there's a whole
set of things that we've shown

50
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:22,402
are non-expansions.

51
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:24,798
Oh, maybe that's even worth remembering.

52
00:02:24,798 --> 00:02:27,468
What are some things
that are non-expansions?

53
00:02:27,468 --> 00:02:28,165
>> A max.

54
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:29,047
>> That's a good one.

55
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:29,883
>> Min.

56
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,785
>> More generally, order statistics.

57
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,387
>> Yes, order statistics.

58
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,663
>> Fixed convex combinations.

59
00:02:36,663 --> 00:02:37,499
>> Uh-huh.

60
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:38,544
That's my favorite.

61
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:41,498
>> Actually, I think all the things
are kind of variations of those two.

62
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:42,798
>> Yeah I think so.

63
00:02:42,798 --> 00:02:46,223
>> You can get fixed convex
combinations of order statistics, so

64
00:02:46,223 --> 00:02:49,071
we can actually combine
those two things together.

65
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:50,975
>> Oh, that's cool.

66
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:52,183
Is there anything else?

67
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:53,350
I think that's all that we covered.

68
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,790
Yeah.
>> Cool.

69
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,200
>> But I think importantly, you said
something that I think was important,

70
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,960
which was that, not just any convex
combinations, but it has to be fixed.

71
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,650
That if the value of it can change,
like with the Boltzmann exploration,

72
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,810
then you do not know
that it will converge.

73
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,390
>> That's right.

74
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,050
It's actually kind of,
maybe an interesting open problem.

75
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,490
It's definitely the case
that we can prove

76
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,860
that Bolton updates
are not non expansions.

77
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,500
They can be expansions.

78
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,420
But that's not quite the same as saying
that therefore it doesn't converge, and

79
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,070
there are some examples of
Q-learning-like update rules that have

80
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,870
update rules that are not non-expansions
and yet it converges anyway.

81
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,000
There's the one that I was involved
with really recently that we called

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,040
coco- Q learning.

83
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,590
>> Of course you did.

84
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,050
>> Which is a two player game set up.

85
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,630
And that one you can show that
it's not a non-expansion, but

86
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,930
it converges anyway.

87
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,143
Phew.

88
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:52,729
>> Okay, so one last thing and
I think we've covered everything but

89
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:54,855
one last thing and
I realize we have an open question.

90
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:56,501
>> Okay.
>> So up in the very first line I

91
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:57,578
we have convergence.

92
00:03:57,578 --> 00:03:59,589
And it's not just convergence for
Q-learning but

93
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:02,728
the Q-learning actually converges to
Q-star, which is mildly miraculous.

94
00:04:02,728 --> 00:04:06,893
All these other things we were looking
at, these generalized operators and

95
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:10,081
the order statistics stuff,
those things converge, but

96
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:11,919
do we know what they converge to?

97
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,655
>> Right, they converge to
that which they converge to.

98
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:19,125
So in general it's not Q*
because we're actually defining

99
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,505
a different set of Bellman Equations.

100
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:22,855
So it actually is defining
a different fixed point.

101
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:27,363
In some cases those fixed
points have good names.

102
00:04:27,363 --> 00:04:30,939
[LAUGH] In some cases not so much.

103
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:34,541
>> But do they converge to something
that looks like the corresponding Q*?

104
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,250
>> If you know what I mean,
do you know what I mean?

105
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:36,790
>> Yeah, yeah yeah.

106
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,580
So the idea is that they
converge to something that

107
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,620
makes sense with regard to how
the Q equation is defined.

108
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,711
So for example if we replace
the max in the action selection

109
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:50,811
with some fixed probability
distribution over actions.

110
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:55,207
That's kind of equivalent, or
maybe even is exactly equivalent,

111
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:57,685
to having a fixed stochastic policy.

112
00:04:57,685 --> 00:05:02,654
And what we get convergence to in that
case is the value of that policy.

113
00:05:02,654 --> 00:05:03,931
>> Okay.

114
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:05,301
So that's good.
That's a big win.

115
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:06,160
All right.

116
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,381
So, did I forget anything?

117
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:14,124
>> No, these are the things that I think
were the critical high points of this

118
00:05:14,124 --> 00:05:16,279
fairly formal section, right.

119
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:18,647
We did a fair amount
of proving of stuff.

120
00:05:18,647 --> 00:05:23,006
I think we're going to do a little more
of that before we get into some more

121
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:25,375
implementation and practical stuff.

122
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,673
>> Okay cool so
then you'll be doing those.

123
00:05:27,673 --> 00:05:28,393
>> Yes.

124
00:05:28,393 --> 00:05:30,367
>> That's great well then I
look forward to next time.

125
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:30,878
>> Awesome.

126
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:31,412
All right.

127
00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:32,480
Thanks Charles.
>> All right.

128
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,090
Bye.
