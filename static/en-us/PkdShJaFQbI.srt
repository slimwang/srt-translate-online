1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now let's introduce another problem.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We have a cavern here with a rickety bridge connecting it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
On this side, which we'll call "here," we have a collection of 4 people

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
who want to get to the other side, which we'll call "there."

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Part of the problem is this is nighttime, and it's dark.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Fortunately, our team has a flashlight or a torch.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The setup is such that the bridge is so rickety that only 2 people at a time

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
can cross, so either one or two people can cross.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's so dark that they need the flash light with them.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
For everybody to get across, two people are going to have to go across.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
One is going to have to come back with the flashlight.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
They'll shuttle each back and forth like that.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now, each of the people has different physical abilities and fear levels,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
so they each take different times to cross the bridge.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This person is speedy, takes 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The question is what combinations of actions will get everybody across the bridge the fastest.
