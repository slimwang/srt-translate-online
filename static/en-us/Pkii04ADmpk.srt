1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So the key point to notice here--

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and this is why the One-Time Pad provides perfect secrecy--

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
is that for any given ciphertext we can produce any message we want

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
by picking different keys.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That means that if we just have the ciphertext,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
we haven't learned anything at all about the message.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The way to produce the message 'BS' from this ciphertext--

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
well, we just need to change this first letter to be one below

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
where C was.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So that means we want to change this bit

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to be a 0 instead of a 1 in the output.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That means we need to flip one bit in the key.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So we'll need to change this key bit

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to be a 1 instead of a 0.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Everything else will be the same.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This will change the output letter by one.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So if you guessed this key instead of the correct key,

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
we get what looks like a fairly reasonable message out

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but it would be one off from the one that was there.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And--in fact, we could get any possible message we want

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
by guessing different keys.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So this is what's called a One-Time Pad,

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and that notion of a One-Time Pad goes back until at least 1882.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It was discovered quite recently that it was known about this early.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
There were One-Time Pads used in World War I,

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and used in many other contexts since then.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The notion of the One-Time Pad being known this early

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
was only discovered last year by Steven Bellovin.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What made a One-Time Pad really interesting was the analysis

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that Claude Shannon did.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Claude Shannon was the father of information theory.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He did some of the first theoretical work in cryptography.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
During World War II, he studied communication,

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and he also studied theory of secret systems,

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and he wrote this paper, which was the first paper

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
that really understood in a theoretical way

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
what it means for a cipher to be good,

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and this paper was written during World War II.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It was classified and released in 1949.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So what we're going to look at next is

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
how you formally reason about a cipher being secure

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and why the One-Time Pad has all the security properties

43
00:01:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that make it a perfect cipher.
