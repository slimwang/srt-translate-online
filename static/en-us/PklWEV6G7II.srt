00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,030
To convince yourself that
this new scan is correct,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,939
there's something you need to
prove about this operator.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,200
What is it?

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,650
Here are four choices, and
I want you to check all that apply.

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,280
The choices are does the operator
have to have constant cost?

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,444
Or does it have to be in place?

7
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:20,690
Or does it have to be associative?

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,840
Or does it have to be commutative?
