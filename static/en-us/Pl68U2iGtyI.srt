00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,260
Well, that's it. You've completed Udacity's Introduction to Data Science

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,220
course. I really hope that you've enjoyed it, and you've learned

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,090
a lot. Having taken this course, you should now be familiar

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,340
with a lot of the tools and techniques that data scientists

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,380
are using on a daily basis. You've also completed an

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,250
entire analysis project investigating ridership on the New York City subway

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,480
system. And you can share that with your friends or your

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,640
family. If you find yourself still interested to learn more about

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,020
data science, I'd highly recommend you take some of the

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,790
data science courses being offered by Udacity. They cover all of

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,840
the topics that we've discussed in this course at a

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,280
much higher level of depth. If nothing else, I hope that

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,570
you've learned that data science isn't just something being used

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,860
in Silicon Valley. More and more, data science is being used

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,190
to solve problems of all different types in industries all over

16
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,220
the world. Well, so long, and thanks for taking the course.
