00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,830
I think one of the great thing
about startups is that it

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,540
puts a great big hurdle in
front of future employees.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,270
It tells them look,
if you want to work here,

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,336
you're going to take a huge salary cut.

5
00:00:11,336 --> 00:00:17,300
Yes, you get equity, but you're going to
sacrifice a lot with the potential for

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,440
amazing rewards but
it's just the potential.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:26,360
That high bar usually attracts,
potentially,

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,940
those employees you want to to hire.

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,980
You want to to make sure you don't
try to compete with salaries,

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,690
often you can't.

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,170
You want to make sure that you
compete with your company's vision.

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,230
You want to compete with the culture,
you want to compete with what it is that

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,870
the company does that no other company
in the world can offer because you're

14
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,150
doing this unique thing that will have
a significant impact on people's lives.

15
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,620
Selling the vision is your
number one tool to recruit and

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,730
the good news is it's aligned with
finding those amazing employees that can

17
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,290
really change your
company in the future.
