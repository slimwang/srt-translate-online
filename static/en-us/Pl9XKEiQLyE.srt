00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Congratulation for completing Unit 1 of our introduction to theoretical computer science.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,230
We have introduced a lot of essential concepts and tools and you have managed

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,730
to master them and now have them at your disposal.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:19,840
You know what a RAM. You know about O notation or big O notation.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,180
You know how to analyze algorithms and you've also learned to understand

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,800
three very, very important problems in computer science known as clique,

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,050
independent set and vertex cover.

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,330
And while discussing these problems, you've also learned about the important concepts of

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:40,670
polynomial time algorithms, exponential time algorithms, and the connected concepts

10
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,770
of tractable problems and intractable problems.

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,850
Having all of these concepts and tools at your disposal, you're ready to dive deeper

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,160
into figuring out if we can make Alice, Bob and Carol happy by finding out that their problems

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,780
are tractable or if we have to bring them bad news and show that their problems are intractable,

14
00:00:59,780 --> 99:59:59,999
but for now again congratulations.
