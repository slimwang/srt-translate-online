00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,918
At the end of the previous video,

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:06,235
we refined our initial question, how popular were the different brands of

3
00:00:06,235 --> 00:00:10,555
candy to a precisely formulated statistical inference problem in which we

4
00:00:10,555 --> 00:00:15,000
want to create a regression estimator for interselection time.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,480
Now before we can do that,

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,050
we must identify what features we'd like to use in our model.

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,130
As you know, if our goal is prediction, we must choose features which have

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,550
some kind of influential force over our response variable.

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,600
Which in this case is interselection time.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,690
Our goal now is to identify what those features might be.

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,320
What features would you use for the model?

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,990
The types of brands?

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,623
The number of each type of candy in the bowl?

14
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,860
The time of day?

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,740
Or the type of candy?
