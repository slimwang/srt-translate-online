00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,250
In many situations, we need to match based

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,290
on inexact criteria, such as all people above a

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,210
certain age, or all cities with populations greater than

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,420
some number. MongoDB provides a variety of operator to

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,370
solve these and other types of problems. So

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,200
the idea with MongoDB operators is very similar to

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,890
what you find in programming languages, where you have

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,190
comparison operators, inequality operators, et cetera. MongoDB operators use

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:30,190
the same syntax as field names. And we distinguish operators from field names

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,670
using the dollar sign character. So, all operators have a leading dollar sign.
