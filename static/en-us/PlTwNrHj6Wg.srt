1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,775
All right, you're done.

2
00:00:01,926 --> 00:00:05,039
I hope you don't mind that I gave you
the larger table this time.

3
00:00:05,123 --> 00:00:06,533
But it depends on the first one,

4
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:08,945
so it would've been hard to give you
in any other order.

5
00:00:09,306 --> 00:00:11,317
I gave you the content value structure,

6
00:00:11,317 --> 00:00:13,679
so it's pretty easy 
to just insert the data.

7
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:15,937
Then, we query the data back out.

8
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:20,986
If move to first fails, the cursor is empty,
and the query failed.

9
00:00:20,986 --> 00:00:22,914
Lots of cut and paste here.

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,091
It is nice to fetch the db values 
using the Helper for the data type,

11
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:29,037
although its not strictly necessary,

12
00:00:29,037 --> 00:00:32,606
since we know our test data is actually
going to match our constraints.

13
00:00:32,606 --> 00:00:35,029
There is one more failure case 
we need to add here,

14
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:37,930
if our query doesn't return any rows.

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,003
And that's it.

16
00:00:40,151 --> 00:00:42,707
All that just to get a database
and a way to test it.

17
00:00:43,132 --> 00:00:45,306
Now let's run the test again.

18
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:48,633
Well, at least we know 
all the basic stuff works,

19
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:51,919
and just remember, without these tests,
you wouldn't have been able

20
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:54,705
to run this code 
for a very, very long time.
