Global illumination is when one object affects another's appearance. Light

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,454
traveling through stained glass and hitting the floor is a case of global

3
00:00:07,454 --> 00:00:12,210
illumination as the glass affects the color of the light hitting the floor.

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,525
Similarly, the bottom of the pool has caustics placed where the light gathers

5
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:20,830
due to the water rippling. Even an object casting a shadow on another object is

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,870
a form of global illumination, in that one object effects the other. The

00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,710
Lambertian, in other words diffuse, and the Blinn-Phong equation are local

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,005
illumination models. They are computed using just the information from the

9
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:37,070
object itself, not using other surrounding objects.
