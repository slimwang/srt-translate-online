00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,610
Let's now have a look at the object oriented architecture style and

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,680
its relationship to maintainability.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,700
The object oriented architecture style is a very powerful way of

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,080
organizing a system.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,580
And maintainability is significantly increased when using this style,

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,360
because of the independence of the components, both their encapsulated data and

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,290
the hands-off, message passing style of interaction.

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,950
On the other hand, objects will have to refer to each other.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,040
Okay? There needs to be some way of identifying other objects in the system.

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,930
This can increase the intercomponent dependencies,

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,450
thereby reducing maintainability.
