00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,950
Now we have had some experience with D3 in the console.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:08,150
I wanted to cover some of the basic structure of a typical D3 visualization.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,400
I will be explaining an example from Mike Bostock's tutorial,

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,440
on creating a basic bar chart and the fundamentals of D3.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,020
I chose this example for three reasons.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,910
The first, is the tutorial is very clear and

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,300
thoroughly explains all of the fundamental concepts of D3.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,240
Once you finish the tutorial, if you decide to go through it and

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,610
create this bar chart you see here.

10
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,750
You will have been exposed to all of the concepts in D3 necessary to build

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,580
more complication visualizations, as you will encounter later in the course.

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,130
The second reason I wanted to go through this code and

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,510
the tutorial is that it's very easily accessible on the web, so

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,420
you can go back and review if you feel unsure about any of the concepts covered.

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,290
But also it's quite ubiquitous and

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,460
very common to other people have encountered the tutorial.

17
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,560
This makes it very easy to share what you've learned and

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,220
collaborate with others.

19
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:11,610
And the third reason is simply the fact that Mike Bostock is the creator if D3.

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,160
And by virtue of having built the library knows all the most important concepts.
