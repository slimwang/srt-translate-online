00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,428
At its simplest texturing works as follows, you take some location on a

2
00:00:03,428 --> 00:00:07,666
surface. Given that location use some function to change the surface attributes

3
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:11,343
at that location. For example you could change the color, shininess,

4
00:00:11,343 --> 00:00:16,097
transparency, normal, or even the surface height or shape. That's all there is

5
00:00:16,097 --> 00:00:19,466
to it. What the lessons ahead will cover is what sorts of functions used, and

6
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:23,950
some of the popular ways to modify the surface. Let's take a concrete example.

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,550
Well maybe not concrete, let's make it wood. In fact, let's make it the most

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,535
popular object in video gaming, the crate. I looked it up. One site claims

9
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:36,391
there are 740-odd video games with crates in them, and counting. You have some

10
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:40,459
object, such as a box. You'd like to make it look like a crate. The most common

11
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:43,039
way to apply a texture to a surface is to use an image and glue it on, sort of

12
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,210
like wallpaper. What you'd like to get out is this, the crate texture applied

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,204
to the box. In 3JS this is amazingly simple. Here's the code snippet that does

14
00:00:52,204 --> 00:00:55,738
it. The first line loads the texture, the second line applies this texture to a

15
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,650
material. Done. Maybe I should just wrap-up this unit with that. For the simple

16
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,407
case, everything just worked. 3JS has a reasonable default for applying a

17
00:01:04,407 --> 00:01:08,672
square texture to square box sides. That said, I should give you fair warning

18
00:01:08,672 --> 00:01:13,340
about loading textures. There are security concerns enforced with Web GL. The

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,900
short version is that you can't normally load some texture from another site

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,640
into your program. Your program and the texture need to be in the same local

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,612
space in order to run. See the additional course materials for more

22
00:01:23,612 --> 00:01:24,576
information.
