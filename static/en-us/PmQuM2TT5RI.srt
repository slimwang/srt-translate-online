1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,660
So here is a good picture of how
virtualization is related to

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,000
security and isolation and
things like that.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,960
This is your physical hardware.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,130
On top of that, we have this hypervisor.

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,060
It's also called a virtual
machine monitor, or VMM.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,652
And on top of that,
we have this different VM.

7
00:00:16,652 --> 00:00:18,637
So, this is VM1.

8
00:00:18,637 --> 00:00:20,739
This is VM2.

9
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:24,478
This is VMn let's say if
you have one of n of those.

10
00:00:24,478 --> 00:00:29,670
If you somehow compromised
this operating system,

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,689
it only effects the user
applications we have here.

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,096
It does nothing to the user
applications we have running

13
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,838
in other virtual machines.

14
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:41,796
This is what we're saying,
is your trusted computing base.

15
00:00:41,796 --> 00:00:43,421
As long as you can trust this,

16
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:46,416
the isolation across virtual
machines is going to work.

17
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:50,091
So, compromise of this operating system
is not going to affect these other

18
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,057
virtual machines and
the applications running in those.

19
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:57,848
For us, virtualization is important
because our focus is in security and

20
00:00:57,848 --> 00:01:00,951
you see this isolation
of these applications.

21
00:01:00,951 --> 00:01:03,796
Earlier they all shared
the same operating system.

22
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:05,840
Now they only share a Hypervisor.

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,180
Why might that give you better security?

24
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,690
We're going to talk about that next.
