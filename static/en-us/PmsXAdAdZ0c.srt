If you got 19 for the numerator, and 135 for the denominator, good job. Let's

2
00:00:04,683 --> 00:00:09,342
see how we got that answer. When we subtract fractions, we also have to have a

3
00:00:09,354 --> 00:00:13,896
common denominator. So the first thing that I need to do is find that common

4
00:00:13,908 --> 00:00:18,805
denominator. When I use the factor tree method, I need a factor in common. For

5
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:25,355
45 and 27, that common factor is 9. I know that 9 times 5 is 45 and I know that

6
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:31,755
9 times 3 gives me 27. If I multiply those together 3 times 9 times 5, I get

7
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:37,680
135. The next thing I need to do is to convert my 2 fractions that I'm

8
00:00:37,692 --> 00:00:45,071
subtracting into equivalent fractions with 135 as the denominator. So, I can

9
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:51,442
take 5 over 27, and I want to have 135 as the denominator. So, 27 times 5 gives

10
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:57,969
me 135 and 5 times 5 gives me 25. Now let's create an equivalent fraction for 2

11
00:00:57,981 --> 00:01:04,907
over 45. Since I want 135 as the denominator. I need to mutliply 45 times 3. And

12
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:11,043
now I have 45 times 3 is 135, and 2 times 3 gives me 6. Now I can rewrite my

13
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:19,145
original subtraction problem with my equivalent fractions. So I have 25 over 135

14
00:01:19,157 --> 00:01:26,496
minus 6 over 135. When I subtract fractions, I keep the denominators the same

15
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:31,289
and I subtract the numerators. 25 minus 6 gives me 19.
