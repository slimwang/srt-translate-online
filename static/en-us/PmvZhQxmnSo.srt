00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,242
We can find the slant asymptotes by using long division, and dividing the above

2
00:00:04,242 --> 00:00:11,917
function. 3x squared plus 2 divided by x. When we divide that, we get 3x plus 2

3
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:17,700
over x. As x gets larger, the term becomes infinitely smaller, and we move

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,749
toward the line y equals 3x, which is our slant asymptote.
