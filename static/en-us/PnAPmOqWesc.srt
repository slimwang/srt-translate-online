1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,800
This first line of text
is the log in message.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,650
When a new terminal is
opened it's common for

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,870
some informational
message to be printed.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,530
The exact contents of this message
depends on the particular system you

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,390
are using and how it's configured.

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,084
On the next line we
see a command prompt.

7
00:00:14,084 --> 00:00:16,808
The appearance of a command prompt
can vary from computer to computer.

8
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,241
But in this case it
includes my username and

9
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:22,610
the name of the computer
I'm logged into.

10
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,060
You might have noticed that there's
actually more than one prompt

11
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,850
on the screen at the same time,
this top one and the bottom one.

12
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,780
This first prompt is one I used
earlier to run a command, so

13
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,600
this is the previous prompt.

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,810
The command I ran earlier was cowsay.

15
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,860
You can see I entered the command here,
and

16
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,950
below that is the opposite
of the command.

17
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,740
Some terminal commands are pretty
cryptic, but in this case,

18
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,810
cowsay is pretty self explanatory.

19
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,870
It takes one argument,

20
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,580
the name of the string which
you would like your cow to say.

21
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,440
After the output of the cowsay command,
we get a new prompt for

22
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,000
entering the next command.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,910
And finally the last interface
element on the screen, is the cursor.

24
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,980
You'll probably notice the cursor
doesn't quite look like the ones

25
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,560
you've seen in other programs.

26
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,638
For instance in a web browser or
word processor,

27
00:01:01,638 --> 00:01:03,270
the cursor is usually a vertical bar.

28
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,330
In the terminal is usually a block, but

29
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,530
you might also see it as
an underscore in some cases.
