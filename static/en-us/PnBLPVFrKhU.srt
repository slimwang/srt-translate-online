00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,447
Try factoring these four terms. Notice that the first two terms are positive,

2
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:08,909
but the second two terms are negative. This means that for these two terms, you

3
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:13,497
should have a negative greatest common factor. Try using our same approach, and

4
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,933
just be careful with the negative sign. Factor this expression and write your

5
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:18,711
answer here.
