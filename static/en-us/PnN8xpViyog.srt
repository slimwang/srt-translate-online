00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,080
Here's one solution. First, the incoming position as copied over so I can

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,850
modify it's values. I then set the Z position with the formula given. I do this

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,040
over two lines and explain what each step does. The rest of the code remains

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,140
the same other than changing every use of the position vector with new

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:16,620
position.
