1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,170
And now we have seen RAID 0, 1, 2, there
is a 3 but we didn't see it, 4, and 5.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,560
Is there such a thing as RAID 6?

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,160
Yes, there is.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,930
It's similar to RAID 5 except
that each group of blocks,

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,030
instead of getting one parity block,
gets two.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,560
Let's call them parity quoted blocks.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,090
They have different types of parity.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,040
And as a results, RAID 6 can work when
there are two failed stripes per group.

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,630
Note that we cannot do this
with two parity blocks.

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,240
One of the blocks that we keep extra,
one of the known data blocks is going

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,150
to be the real parity block, and
that's what fixes one error.

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:47,650
The second of the two blocks is
a different type of check-blocks, and

13
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:52,650
when only one disk has failed,
we use the parity to recover.

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:57,960
But when two disks have failed,
we can still solve some equations,

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,740
where the data and
the two types of check-blocks figure, so

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,940
that we can still recover
the content of the two failed disks.

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,860
So let's compare RAID 5 and RAID 6.

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,350
RAID 6 has twice the overhead of RAID 5,

19
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,880
so we pay twice as much for
this increased reliability.

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,630
There is more write overhead because
really now when we update a data block

21
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,850
we need to read and write the data
block and both of the check-blocks,

22
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,960
the parity and the second one
are also read and written.

23
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,233
So there are now six accesses per write

24
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:37,230
versus four per write
that we had with RAID 5.

25
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,170
So the only reason for having RAID 6,

26
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,150
if there is a good chance
of when a disk fails,

27
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:48,610
another one failing before we manage
to replace the failed first drive.

28
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,390
So note that in any of the RAID
configurations, once your disk fails,

29
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,040
you don't keep going and
ignore the failed drive.

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,550
You keep going, but
you order a replacement or

31
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:05,180
get a replacement and install it so that
the RAID array can re-establish itself.

32
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,420
After that, you can lose another disk.

33
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,599
So really RAID 6,
with its ability to lose two disks,

34
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,790
only helps if when a disk fails,
there is a good

35
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,810
chance of another failing before
the first one is replaced.

36
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,420
The faster we replace the first drive,

37
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,290
the less chance there is that another
disk fails during that period of time.

38
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,790
Remember that the probability of a disk
failing during an hour is extremely low,

39
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,570
so even if we spent something like three
days replacing a disk, the probability

40
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:42,970
of a disk failing in that specific time,
while we are vulnerable,

41
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,070
is very, very low, and then it
seems that RAID 6 is an overkill.
