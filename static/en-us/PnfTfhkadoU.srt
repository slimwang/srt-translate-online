00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This unit we'll return to the topic of planning,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and we'll talk about 4 things that we left out last time we talked about planning.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
First is time.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That is, rather than just saying whether an action occurs before an action or after it,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We'll talk about actions that persists over a length of time.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Second is resources necessary to do a task.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Third is active perception--

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That is, taking the action of perceiving something.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Fourth is hierarchical plans--that is, plans that consist of steps which have substeps.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We'll start with time.
