00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,713
Now we're going to move on to talk about the sensory cortex next. But before we

2
00:00:03,713 --> 00:00:07,105
do, lets quickly look at what we know about the short term and long term memory

3
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:11,375
systems in regards to the brain. Remember that our sensory memories are

4
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:15,730
processed in various cortices in our brain. Our short-term memory is processed

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,327
in the hippocampus and frontal lobes. And finally, our long-term memory is

6
00:00:20,327 --> 00:00:24,032
stored in different parts of the cortex and sub-cortex and these memories are

7
00:00:24,032 --> 00:00:29,327
retrieved with help from areas associated with the prefrontal cortex. Now

8
00:00:29,327 --> 00:00:33,685
remember that the prefrontal cortex. is the foremost region of the frontal

9
00:00:33,685 --> 00:00:37,095
lobes and it plays a very important role in attention, appropriate social

10
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:41,810
behavior, working memory, and impulse control. Those are really importnat to

11
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:42,421
remember.
