00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,830
We know inequality's can be solved just like equations. But there is one

2
00:00:03,842 --> 00:00:08,157
exception. An inequality sign behaves different when you multiply or divide both

3
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:12,286
sides by a negative value. Let's look at that. I am going to start by not doing

4
00:00:12,298 --> 00:00:16,572
division or multiplication, I am going to do subtraction. First, I subtract one

5
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:21,346
from both sides, and I get 1 is greater than 0. Then, I can subtract 2 from both

6
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:25,791
sides and I get negative 1 is greater than negative 2. This causes a lot of

7
00:00:25,803 --> 00:00:30,655
trouble for students. Let's look at this. Here's negative 1 and here's negative

8
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:35,217
2. We know negative 1 is closer to 0, it's further to the right on the number

9
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:40,044
line, so it must be bigger in value compared to negative 2. But we're not after

10
00:00:40,056 --> 00:00:44,234
comparing numbers here. We want to know about the inequality sign. I've

11
00:00:44,246 --> 00:00:48,399
rewritten negative 1 is greater than negative 2 and instead of doing the

12
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:52,884
subtraction twice, what if we just would've multiplied? If we multiplied both

13
00:00:52,896 --> 00:00:58,508
sides of our inequality by negative 1, we'll get negative 2 and negative 1. But

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,305
I can't just carry my inequalities straight down. We know negative 1 is greater

15
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:08,043
than negative 2, so the sign has to reverse in direction. The same is true when

16
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:12,647
dividing by a negative 1. We know when we divide by a negative 1, we change the

17
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,319
signs of the numbers. So, I'll still need to flip my inequality sign. These

18
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:22,261
inequalities might look different, but they're actually equivalent statements.

19
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:26,995
Here, I have negative 1 is greater than negative 2, and here, I have negative 2

20
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:31,729
is less than negative 1. If we flip this entire inequality, we can see that we

21
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:36,558
wind up with the same thing. We get negative 2 is less than negative 1. The key

22
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,414
thing to remember when solving inequality problems is to reverse the direction

23
00:01:41,426 --> 00:01:45,275
of the sign when you multiply or divide both sides by a negative.
