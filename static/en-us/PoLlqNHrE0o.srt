1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:06,030
The third advanced feature of ACME is what's called its open semantic framework.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,310
ACME has a simple vocabulary, a simple syntax, and also,

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:15,230
a very simple semantics, but there obviously could be lots of

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,460
information you'd like to encode in an architectural description.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,950
And, encoding all that complexity you would like to also have some way

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,140
of checking it for whether it's valid.

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,560
ACME itself and the ACME tools don't provide that checking, but

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,450
they do provide a way for you to essentially export your

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:39,590
description in such a way that it can used, be used by external checking tools.

10
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,860
That's what the open semantic framework is.

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,510
In particular, the description that you've either drawn, using ACME Studio,

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,700
or you've typed in, using the editor,

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,330
can be used to generate a description in first order logic.

14
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,290
That description can then be used by an external tool,

15
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,480
which takes as input the first order logic.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,750
And proves whatever it needs to do, such, such, for

17
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:11,920
example that the particular architecture you've described obey's certain rules.

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,780
There's an example here for the client server situation.

19
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,450
And it's essentially a an English language keyword version of first order logic.

20
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,680
It says that there exists a thing called client, a thing called server,

21
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:33,270
a thing called RPC such that client is a component, server is a component,

22
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,060
RPC is a connector, and that they're attached in a way we've described.

23
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,300
This, this contains exactly the information we saw in the ACME description.

24
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,460
But now it's in a form that can be dealt with by a fair improver, or

25
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,550
automatic reasoning system.
