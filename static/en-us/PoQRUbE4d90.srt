1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is now 6.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You can really see that this helicopter can assume any location in xyz space,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
but it also has 3 rotation degrees of freedom.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It has a yaw, which is its bearing.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It can tilt forward and backward.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And it can roll left and right.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If we look from above, here is the yaw.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is the tilt.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If you look from the front, you find there is also a roll variable

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
where the vehicle can turn around its own axis.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So the total answer is 6.
