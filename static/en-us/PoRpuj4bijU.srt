1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And this is an easy answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The nearest neighbor is this point over here,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
so for 1 we say plus.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
For 3 neighbors, we get 2 positive, 1 negative.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's still plus.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
For 5 neighbors--1, 2, 3, 4, 5--

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we get 3 negative, 2 positive.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's a minus.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
For 7, we get 3 positive but still 4 negative,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
so it's negative.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And for 9, the positives outweigh the negative,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
so you get a plus.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Obviously, as you can see, as K increases,

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
more and more data points are being consulted.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So when K finally becomes 9,

16
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
all those data points are in and make a much smoother result.
