00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now that we have an equation for that almost geostationary orbit.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's look at what the computer simulation does to that, so we start at this point, wait for 24 hours,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
precisely 24 hours, and look at what's going to happen.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Most probably, we're not going to reach that same precise location but end up

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
in a slightly different location, and the objective of this quiz is to compute

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the distance between the initial position and the position after precisely 24 hours

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
to learn about the error of our method.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We've got tons of stuff predefined ready for you to use.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Your job is to insert the Euler forward method right at this point.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Your job is not to return the positions and the velocities, your job is to return just a single number,

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
namely the error--the distance between the initial position and the final position--

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and up front of course compute the step size.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Given the number of steps, make sure that you actually are taking, for instance, 200 steps

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
after that initial position or 500 or 1000 and so on.
