1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,260
The second one might have been tricky but they both equal negative 1. We want to

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,220
remember that the negative sign is really a negative 1 being multiplied by this

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,180
expression. We know x plus 3 divided by x plus 3 equals 1. So now we can

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,720
simplify our fraction. This just leaves us with negative 1. For our second

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,595
rational expression, we can think of a 1 being outside of the expression a plus

6
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:27,174
4. For the denominator, we're going to factor out a negative 1. Leaving us with

7
00:00:27,174 --> 00:00:31,714
negative 1 a plus 4. If we were to distribute this negative 1 back inside the

8
00:00:31,714 --> 00:00:36,530
parenthesis we'd get our original denominator. We know this step is correct. We

9
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,105
can simplify the a plus 4s since they equal 1leaving us with 1 times 1 in the

10
00:00:41,105 --> 00:00:45,785
numerator and negative 1 times 1 in the denominator. This just simplifies to

11
00:00:45,785 --> 00:00:50,268
negative 1. You might have spotted this first one easily. Great work if you. If

12
00:00:50,268 --> 00:00:53,293
you did. It's okay if this one gave you trouble.
