Did you notice how when we called
decodeObjectForKey we had to cast

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,410
each of the returned values?

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,060
Why do you think we had to do that?

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,215
Take a minute to guess and
then continue on.

If we Alt+Click on the method
decodeObjectForKey so we can look

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,230
at the documentation, we see that it
returns an object of type AnyObject.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,470
Well, in any object optional that is.

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,510
Of course, in Swift, we want our
objects to have specific types.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,280
Compensating for

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,430
differences like this in typing is
a common interoperability challenge.
