1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
One dimension in motion is not enough for us.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We need 2 dimensions or even 3 dimensions.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We need vectors.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If you know about vectors directly, skip to the quiz.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If you don't, stay with me.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Vectors can be represented by arrows.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Typically, we denote vectors by lowercase Latin characters

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
with an arrow on top of them,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and we can also express them in numbers.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This arrow vector is 4 units to the right

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and 3 units up,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
which is why we can write 4, 3 in this way.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
These are called components of the vector -- x-component, y-component

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
if the x-axis points right, and the y-axis points up,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's look at a second vector.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If you call this vector B, that would be 2, 1

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
x-component 1, y-component 2.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's have a third vector that's called C,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and C should be 1, -3.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
C goes right by 1 unit and goes down

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
by 3 units.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And now we can do some basic arithmetics.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We can add vectors, for instance.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's add B and C.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If we want to add B and C, we put them together.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The tail of C goes to the tip of B or the other way around,

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and the resulting vector, which is B + C

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
goes from the tail of B to the tip of C.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So this is the sum of the vectors --

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
B + C -- and if you look closely,

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
you'll see this is 1, 2, 3 units to the right --

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and this one is canceled with that one --

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and 2 units down.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So what we actually could've computed is

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
the x-component of B plus the x-component of C -- 3 --

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and the y-component of B plus the y-component of C makes 2.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's the sum of vectors.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You simply add the components,

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and geometrically, you chain these arrows.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And there's a second operation we can do.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We can multiply vectors with numbers.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
For instance, if I want to multiply this vector B

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
by 3/2, I get an arrow in the same direction,

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
but with 50% more length.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I can do that in components, of course, as well.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So what I get is 3/2 times 2 and 3/2 times 1,

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
which is 3 and downstairs 1.5.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Obviously, 3 units to the right,

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
1.5 units up.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
If you do this multiplication with negative numbers,

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
we are going to invert the direction of the arrow.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So if I compute, say, -1/2B,

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I get an arrow of the opposite direction and 1/2 the length.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and components -1/2 * 2 = -1,

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
-1/2 * 1 = -1/2.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So this goes 1 unit to the left

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and 1/2 unit down.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If you remember the NumPy package in Python,

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
this vector addition and vector multiplication

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and the NumPy package in Python

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
this addition and this type of multiplication is already included.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The third operation that we can apply to all vectors,

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
is determining their lengths.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm writing it like that with double bars.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
To determine the length, you can simply use

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
the Pythagorean Theorem.

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
One leg of this right triangle is 4 units long.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The other leg is 3 units long,

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
which means that the hypotenuse is

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
4² + 3² square root units long,

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
which means 16 + 9, 25 square root, 5 units.
