00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,050
A lot of the games we've been talking
about use consumable in-app purchases.

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,260
But there are three main
types of in-app purchases.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,240
Consumables, entitlements,
and subscriptions.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,520
Consumables are items that
get used up in the game.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,550
Sort of like food you consume and
have to keep buying.

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,900
Only these are usually power ups that
you have to buy or earn over and

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,160
over again.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,060
Entitlements are things that
the player buys and then gets to keep.

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,015
Like a sword you get to keep or
level you can permanently unlock.

10
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:33,935
And finally, subscriptions
are things that the player gets

11
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:35,835
as long as they keep playing.

12
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:39,265
Sort of like entitlements,
only you have to renew them over time.

13
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:42,195
So these are the three main
types of in-app purchases.

14
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:44,025
Let's look at some
real examples of these.
