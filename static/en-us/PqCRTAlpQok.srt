1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,730
Okay, so now we have some idea of what
is privacy in the online context.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,280
What kind of information is private and
what may not be private.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,790
Let's talk about some
threats to privacy.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,560
Well on the internet, we talk about
a source of a request that goes to

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,670
a certain service or a destination, and
so we communicate between two endpoints.

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,620
Analysis of who's talking to who.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,860
Obviously, think that who I
communicate with should be private.

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,010
Of course this traffic
analysis is a threat to that.

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,380
It can violate, or
disclose that information.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,338
Other threat to privacy is,
of course, large scale surveillance.

11
00:00:41,338 --> 00:00:47,239
And recently, in fact this month,
this letter from this encryption

12
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,327
experts was published about
the law enforcement agency's

13
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:58,632
claim that if we allow encryption
without, sort of, some way to undo it,

14
00:00:58,632 --> 00:01:04,150
or backdoors and things like that,
then it's like going dark.

15
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,390
Their ability to see what bad guys
are doing completely going away.

16
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,710
So, the other people who
are arguing against that by saying,

17
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,390
this is sort of the golden
age of surveillance.

18
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,820
The amount of information they
can collect is unprecedented.

19
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,196
So, in some sense, everything you do
online potentially can be tracked and

20
00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:27,990
collected, information about your
activities can be collected.

21
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,870
So if somebody is doing that, of course,
that's a massive threat to privacy.

22
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,660
Finally, with big data, data mining
analytics that we have, we can do all

23
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,160
kind of inferences and link different
pieces of information, okay.

24
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,392
When we talked about
database of privacy,

25
00:01:46,392 --> 00:01:52,190
we did discuss inference attacks and
anonymization and things like that.

26
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,700
Well, those could be defeated and
we have, by linking different pieces of

27
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,500
information, very simple
online advertising.

28
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,500
They're sort of making a guess
that you visit certain websites or

29
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,500
click on certain kind of links,
you'll be interested in certain things.
