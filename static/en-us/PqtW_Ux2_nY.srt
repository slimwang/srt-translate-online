1
00:00:00,195 --> 00:00:02,170
And let's say, I mean, there's many different solutions, but

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,540
I'd say the best answer is, minus 1 for

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,340
the x because we go left and still plus 1 for y.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,860
These are two what's called orthogonal vectors.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,470
Those define the two principle directions here.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,650
In reality, when we write vectors in PCA,

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,320
what you find is lowest output vectors is normalized to one.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,820
This one here has a length of square root of 2.

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,884
So when you, when you rescale those vectors,

10
00:00:25,884 --> 00:00:30,140
you find that square root of 2 over here minus square root of 2.

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,791
And square of 2 vectors of that length have a total length of 1,

12
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:40,407
because the total length is given by the square root of the squares of the sum.

13
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:46,512
Being as it is; the principal vectors found by PCA are the one over here,

14
00:00:46,512 --> 00:00:48,426
and the one over here.

15
00:00:48,426 --> 00:00:49,400
So let's do this again.
