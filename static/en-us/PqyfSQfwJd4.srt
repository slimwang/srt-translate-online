1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,240
So there's a time in almost every
business where you're going to

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,280
need to scale beyond what you have
available to you resource wise.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,700
And at this point, you have to reach
out to investors because otherwise,

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,490
it's sink or swim.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,020
You won't be able to
get to that next level.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,220
You won't be able to grow or
scale your business,

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,660
and sometimes without growth or
skill your business is in trouble.

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,290
So at that point,
you want to bring an investor in.

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,880
And in the case of one of my companies,
we had to bring an investor in because

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,290
we had to hire more people and we had
to scale up our technology production.

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,680
And that was a very lengthy and
involved process overall.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,860
It took almost a year just to close
that first round of financing.
