00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,230
So we've looked at creating
objects using code, and

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,280
part of that required us
to talk about quaternions.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,090
Let's check your knowledge about them.

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,172
&gt;&gt; So what are quaternions used for?

5
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:12,645
Are they the way you create new objects?

6
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:15,801
Are they a way to store
positions in space?

7
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:18,780
Or are they a way to rotate objects?

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,510
&gt;&gt; What do you think?
