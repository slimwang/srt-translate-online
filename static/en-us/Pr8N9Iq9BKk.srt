00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,460
When I started learning how to code,
I use the concept of learning zones

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,300
to help me map out my new
journey as a new programmer.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,750
I always reflected on
the skills I was learning and

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,100
tracked whether I was in my safe zone,

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,530
where concepts are familiar and
where we don't need to take any risks.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,630
Stretch zone where we're
introduced to new concepts, and

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,220
we're making new discoveries.

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,920
Or STRAIN zone,
where learning becomes difficult and

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,680
is often blocked by
sense of frustration.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,500
The border between the STRETCH and

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,970
the STRAIN zone is the point
of maximum learning.

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,510
Our goal is to keep you between your
STRETCH and your STRAIN zone, so

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,150
you are always learning.

14
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,390
Whenever you learn something new you
may feel like your learning zones

15
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,070
are fluctuating.

16
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,650
One moment you could be
in your safe zone and

17
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,075
the next minute you're
in your strain zone.

18
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:50,020
This should be totally expected.

19
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,260
Learning something new especially
programming can be a winding journey

20
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,030
with many highs and lows.

21
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,970
Let's read a little bit more
about your learning zones.
