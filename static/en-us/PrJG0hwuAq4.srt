I've chosen the name Account. You may have something that's slightly different.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,160
But in, in UML there's a convention that class names begin with a capital

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,239
letter. For attributes I have an account number, the owner of the account,

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,250
the current balance, which happens to be a derived attribute. That is, it's

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,200
computed rather than being something that is specified and changed. As far as

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,490
operations are concerned there's obviously going to be deposits and withdrawals.

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,780
Of course you could elaborate on these three compartments by filling in all of

8
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,060
the possible notational possibilities that are, that are there.

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,520
But for now this gives you an idea of what class rectangles are used for.
