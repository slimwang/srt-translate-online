00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,942
Lets analysis for a second why this graph has this particular behavior with the

2
00:00:03,942 --> 00:00:09,110
ends pointing in the same direction on either side up really, really high. To

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,530
do that I like you to form this x, y table for this function y equals x to the

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,836
4, now you notice that the x values over here are ordered in a little bit

5
00:00:15,836 --> 00:00:19,541
familiar each of these pairs of numbers one is just the negative version of the

6
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:26,540
previous one I think you'll see why in just a second. I'd actually recommend

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,640
doing most of these calculations by hand so you can see why y is taking on the

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,529
value that it is.
