1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,250
So at this point you may be thinking, another middleman class?

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,640
Why would I want to take the time to create this?

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,190
Well, app developers create content providers for a few reasons.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,300
Reason number one, as an extra level of abstraction,

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,360
they allow developers to change the underlying data source without needing to

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,570
change any code in the applications that access the content provider.

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,627
The second reason, some important Android classes such as SyncAdapters, Loaders,

8
00:00:25,627 --> 00:00:28,640
and CursorAdapters use content providers.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,880
So, if you want to use these classes,

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,720
you need the data accessible through a content provider.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,150
But really the main reason that you use a content provider is to open up

12
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,220
the data source to other app developers so that they can access, use and

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,450
modify your data source, which, if you didn't use a content provider,

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,180
would otherwise be just limited to your app.

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,560
And while other apps are using your content provider to access your data,

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,090
they're doing it in a secure and

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,480
managed way because you chose to use a content provider.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,370
So let's see how this helps in the business card example.

19
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,440
Here we have our business card.

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,849
Now, if we weren't using the contacts content provider,

21
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,860
we might store our data in a separate database.

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,410
This is no good because the default contacts app can't access your

23
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,610
data over here.

24
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,400
So instead, what we do is use the contacts content provider and

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,610
give the business card information to the content provider,

26
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,100
which then updates the data source for contacts and saves it to the database.

27
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,560
Then, when the default contact app loads up the contact information,

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,900
it'll get the information from your business card.

29
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,490
And really, all you had to do was pass off your business card information to

30
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,880
the content provider.

31
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,840
This whole process was black boxed from you, so it's easy.

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,330
As a developer, all you need to do is change a couple of app permissions and

33
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,650
add maybe one line of code.
