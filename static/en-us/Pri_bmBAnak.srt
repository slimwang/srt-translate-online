00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,560
We can use a similar approach for a problem like this, the absolute value or the

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:10,854
distance of 2 d plus 1 is 7. Notice I can draw the same diagram. This could be

3
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:16,068
the location of 2 d plus 1 at negative 7, or 2 d plus 1 could be positive 7. The

4
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:21,507
distance of this expression is 7 on both sides of the number line. So, we're

5
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,442
asking ourselves, what value of d would make this true? What do you think? What

6
00:00:26,454 --> 00:00:31,032
would d equal in this case and d equal in this case? Take some time to think

7
00:00:31,044 --> 00:00:31,565
about it.
