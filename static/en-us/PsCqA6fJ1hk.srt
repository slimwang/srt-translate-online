1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,570
So, for this question, your goal is to guess

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:07,430
the expected time to execute the query. Lookup index10M where

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,510
the string is eight a's. Where index10m, 10m, is

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,360
the index created by make_big_index passing in 10 million at

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,630
this size. And I should warn you this is

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,116
a bit of a trick question. So, think careful about

7
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:22,790
what make_big_index does and what lookup does. And here

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,400
are the possible answers. So, it could be 0.0 seconds.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,200
It could be 0.1 seconds. It could be 1.0 seconds, or it could be 10 seconds.
