00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Norvig] And the correct answer is that there would be no error. It would still be fair.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Each permutation of the deck would occur with equal probability,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but it would take N divided by N - 1 times longer--just a tiny bit longer.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We can see that what's happening here is if you remember what our deck looked like,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
when we got to the second to last element,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
we swapped the second to last element with a random selection from the last 2,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
so that's up to N - 1.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If we changed the range to go all the way to N, then we would do 1 more step

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
where we would swap the last element with an item in the range of just the last element.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So swapping the last element with itself--that would be the only choice--

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
that wouldn't really do anything effective.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It wouldn't hurt. It would just take a little bit longer.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And so to avoid that redundant operation, we'd use N - 1 rather than N.
