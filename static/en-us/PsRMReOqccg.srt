00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,569
Now I know our work up to this point

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:03,620
with this yogurt data set has been review and it

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,570
should be, but lets hear from Dean about how we

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,000
might proceed differently with this type of a data set.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,650
>> When familiarizing yourself with a new data set that

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,560
contains multiple observations of the same units, it's often useful

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,285
to work with a sample of those units so that

8
00:00:20,285 --> 00:00:23,969
it's easy to display the raw data for that sample.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,260
In the case of the yogurt data set, we might want to look at a small sample

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,910
of households in more detail so that we know

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,520
what kind of within and between household variation we

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,010
are working with. This analysis of a sub-sample might

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,430
come before trying to use within household variation as

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,520
part of a model. For example, this data set

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,060
was originally used to model consumer preferences for variety.

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,190
But, before doing that, we'd want to look at how often we observe households

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,330
buying yogurt, how often they buy multiple items, and what prices they're buying

18
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:06,822
yogurt at. One way to do this is to look at some sub-sample

19
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:11,830
in more detail. Let's pick 16 households at random and take a closer look.
