00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,896
Now what do we get if we multiply this entire quantity x minus 2 times what we

2
00:00:03,896 --> 00:00:08,480
wrote up here, x squared? Please write your answer in this box, and make sure

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,928
that you write it in standard form for polynomials. So in other words write the

4
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:17,949
highest degree term here and then the next highest here and so on and so forth.
