00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,190
This brings us to the first quiz. After every lesson in this

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,470
course we'll have a short quiz, in which we'll ask you to write down what you

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,840
learned in this lesson in this blue box here. These quizzes have two goals.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,830
The first goal is to help you synthesize and organize what you have learned.

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,440
The process of writing down what you learned may help you, in fact,

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,350
learn it more deeply. The second goal is to provide us with feedback. Perhaps we

7
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,550
could have been clearer or more precise about some of the concepts. Perhaps we

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,450
left some misconceptions. Note that these quizzes are completely optional.
