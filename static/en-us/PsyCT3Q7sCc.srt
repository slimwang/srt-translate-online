00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,180
Our next lemma states the key property

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,040
of a phase of
the Hopcroftâ€“Karp algorithm.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,550
Each phase increases the length of
the shortest path by at least two.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,040
For the proof, we'll let Q be
a shortest augmenting path

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,720
after a phase that augmented
with paths of length k.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,090
It's impossible for Q to be less than k,

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,140
by a previous lemma which showed that
augmenting by a shortest augmenting path

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,710
never decreased the minimum
augmenting path length.

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,340
On the other hand, Q being equal to
k implies that Q is vertex disjoint

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,690
from all paths found in the previous
phase, by the lemma we just showed.

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,160
But then it would have
been part of the phase,

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,190
so that doesn't make any sense either.

13
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,980
Thus, Q is greater than k and
it also has to be odd, so

14
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,980
the size of Q must be equal to k plus 2.

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,450
k itself was, of course, odd as well.

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,470
And that completes the lemma.
