00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,220
Okay, let's look at the solution for our

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,540
data dependencies quiz. We have these four instructions.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,020
And for each type of dependence, we need

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,740
to figure whether these pairs of instructions have these

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,520
dependencies. Let's start I1 to I3. We already

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,950
know that there is no read off the

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,975
write dependence. That is because I3 doesn't use

8
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:25,139
the R1 value produced by the I1. Right after

9
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:30,023
read, would mean that I3's writing a result into a

10
00:00:30,023 --> 00:00:35,129
register that was supposed to be read by I1 which is not

11
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:40,600
true. Write after write would mean that I3 is overwriting

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,658
the result by I1 and that is true. Now let's go from I1

13
00:00:45,658 --> 00:00:50,560
to I4. I1 is producing R1. I4 is reading

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,285
R1, but the value that I4 is supposed to read here,

15
00:00:55,285 --> 00:01:00,740
is not the one produced by I1. It is the value produced by I3.

16
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:06,490
So in fact, there is no raw dependence from I1 to I4.

17
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,284
That would occur only if I4 was reading R1 that was produced

18
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:15,630
by I1, which is not happening. Is there a right

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,518
after independence? Is I4 over-writing R4 that was supposed to be

20
00:01:21,518 --> 00:01:27,766
read by I1? No, because I1 is not reading R4. Finally, is there a write

21
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:34,500
after write dependence? No, for two reasons. One is that I4 is writing

22
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,320
to a different register than I1, so there cannot be an output dependence.

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,854
Another reason is that even if I4 was writing

24
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:47,667
to R1 that would be an output dependence between

25
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:53,060
I3 and I4. So there would be an output dependence from I1 to I3 and then from I3

26
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,720
to I4, but because the right is happening to

27
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,170
R4 and here to R1, certainly there is no

28
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,280
write after write dependence. Finally, let us look at

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,910
I2 to I3. Is there a read after write dependence?

30
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:13,955
Is I2 producing a register that is read by I3? No, it is not. Write

31
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:20,007
after read would mean that I3 is overwriting a register that I2 needed to read,

32
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:26,550
and that is true, because I2 needs to read R1 before I3 overwrites it.

33
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:32,210
So we have a write after read dependence. And finally, we do not have a write

34
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,790
after write because there are different registers for

35
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:40,050
writing. So this is, again, not selected. So

36
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,940
the only check marks you were supposed to put in are this one and this one.
