1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,982
So, we know this perimeter equation is really the same as 18 minus w equals l.

2
00:00:04,982 --> 00:00:09,896
And here, our area equation stays the same. Now we're ready to perform

3
00:00:09,896 --> 00:00:14,556
substitution. We know the length equals 18 minus w, so we can replace this

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:19,980
length with this expression. Be sure you use parentheses when you replace the

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,640
length with 18 minus w. And then, try and solve for the width and the length.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,224
Keep in mind that the length should be the longer side for whichever value you

7
00:00:29,224 --> 00:00:31,080
find. Good luck.
