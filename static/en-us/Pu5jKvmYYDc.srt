1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,140
Okay.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,750
time for another task.

3
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,870
We're going to create a new shared
preference to store the status of our

4
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,340
location, which also means
creating a new string and

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,430
the resources to name the preference.

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,280
Now I tested this by
changing the forecast base

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,890
URL to a few servers that
produce the desired results.

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,240
See the instructor notes for details.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,940
You can use breakpoints or logging
to make sure your code is called.

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,020
We'll be connecting it
to the UI soon enough.
