1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,770
It's time for an exercise.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,490
This time we'll explore indexes
in your app, and specifically,

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,510
we'll look at composite index creation.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,370
We're going to deploy a query
that needs a composite index

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,370
without first running it
on the development server.

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,890
Then we'll fix it by running it
on the development server and

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,000
look at the index file and
deploy and see that it works then.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,590
So, first, let's see what happens if
you deploy an application to app spot

9
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,040
that requires a new index,
but you don't have it.

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,570
So we're going to add a filter
to our app, asking only for

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,610
conferences in the month of June.

12
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,110
Number six is June.

13
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,250
Once you add this filter,
save your file and

14
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,470
go ahead and
deploy it directly to app spot.

15
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,160
In this case,
do not run it on local host first.

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,090
So don't hit the run button
just go straight to deploy.

17
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,460
And once the logs say that your
application has been deployed

18
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,250
go the API's explorer, make sure
that you're on the deployed app and

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,590
not local host.

20
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,230
Go to the filter playground method and
execute it.

21
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:54,870
What happens?
