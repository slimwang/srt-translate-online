00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,315
Okay.

2
00:00:00,317 --> 00:00:03,534
I know the value of a circle is five, so I can replace the circle with a five.

3
00:00:03,622 --> 00:00:06,993
So I have triangle minus five. But here is my problem, I don't know what the

4
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:10,555
triangle is, I don't know the value of it. The triangle could represent any

5
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:14,320
number, so it's impossible for me to know how to evaluate this. It's okay if you

6
00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:17,144
didn't get this one right. I just want to get you thinking.
