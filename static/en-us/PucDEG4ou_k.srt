00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,430
Now that you're going to be putting
another computer out there on

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,100
the Internet, accessible by anyone,
we need to discuss security.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,240
Not only for
your own application's sake, but

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,530
for everyone else out there as well.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,560
If a bad guy gets access to your server,
they can do anything they want with it.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,530
Send spam, launch denial of
service attacks, and so much more.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,930
In this lesson we'll discuss
a number of security-related topics,

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,330
including managing users, packages or

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,770
the software installed on the server,
various methods of authenticating users,

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,680
how Linux manages file permissions, and
finally, how to configure a firewall.
