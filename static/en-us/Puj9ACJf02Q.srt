00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,730
Thinking about this, if we wanted to blur a single pixel into a blurry spot,

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,280
we would need to filter that spot with what?

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,040
Is it A, 3x3 uniform weights?

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,290
Is it B, an 11x11 square of uniform weights?

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,140
C, is something that looks like that blurry spot?
