1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So now we have, learned pretty much, all there is to know about Planning Under Uncertainty.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We talked about Markov Decision Processes.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We explained the concept of information spaces;

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and what's better, you can actually apply it.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You can apply it to a huge number of problems

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
where the outcome of states are uncertain.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There is a huge legislation about robot motion planning.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Here are some examples of robots moving through our environments

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that use MDP-style planning techniques;

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and these methods have become vastly popular in artificial intelligence--

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
so I'm really glad you now understand the basics

12
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of those and you can apply them yourself.
