00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,920
Here's a filled in version of our table. Notice again, how we can

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,950
see that the signs of the quantities, x minus 5 and then x plus 7 are related to

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,520
the sign of their product. If we have a negative number times a negative number,

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,340
it always gives us a positive number. Anything times 0 is 0. And if

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,820
we have a negative and a positive multiplied together, we get a negative number.
