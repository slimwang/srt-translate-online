1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,930
Now lets take a look at the profile form class in the form package. You

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:11,546
see it finds fields display name, and t-shirt

3
00:00:11,546 --> 00:00:15,250
size. It also defines enum's limit the t-shirt

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,120
size, because there is only a certain

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,170
range of values for t-shirt size. We're going

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,030
to update the safe profile method in conference

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,620
API, to restrict the input data to display

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,200
name and tee shirt size. it's easy to do

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,420
that simply by specifying profile form as the input data

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,710
argument. So here I'm looking at the save profile

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,960
method in the conference API class, and you'll see I've

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,330
passed in profile form as an argument. So, now

13
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,080
that we pass a profile form into the save profile

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,730
method, we need to use it. So, I've added the

15
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,760
code to get the display name out of the profile

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,800
form, and also to get the t-shirt size out of

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,760
the profile form. For the T shirt size, we only

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,440
want to set it if the profile form actually sent

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,760
it, so we added the conditional check that it's not

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,960
now. For the display name, I'm not adding that extra

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,540
check because later on, we'll be setting a default display

22
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,210
name based on the user's email, but we don't know

23
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,190
that just yet. Now we can try out our changes.
