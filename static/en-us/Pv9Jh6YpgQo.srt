00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,490
In this class we have talked a lot about how AI agents must be able to

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,750
reason about the work. But the external work consists of systems from many

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,570
different kinds. A system is composed of heterogeneous interacting components.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,460
The interaction within components, lead to processes of different kinds.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,119
These processes can occur at many different of those abstraction.

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,070
Some of the processes might be invisible. Consider an ecosystem.

7
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,380
In an ecosystem, processes occur at many levels of abstraction. Physical,

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,200
biological, chemical. Some of these processes are invisible to the naked eye,

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,800
but they influence each other. Similarly in business, businesses are composed of

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,440
a large number of interacting units, manufacturing, marketing, delivery, and so

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,410
on. Each of these units can be described at many levels of abstraction, from

12
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,540
individuals, to teams, to full organizations. Given that the extra work consists

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,730
of systems of different kinds. Their agents must be capable of systems thinking.

14
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,700
They must be capable of thinking about the invisible properties of systems.

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,050
About the complex behavior of the systems. In particular,

16
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:16,080
they must be able to derive the invisible processes from the visible structure.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,520
This is systems thinking.
