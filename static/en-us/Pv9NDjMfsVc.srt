00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,490
>> That's right David and that means that means-ends analysis doesn't not

2
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:41,180
always take us to what's the goal. Sometimes it can take us away from the goal.

3
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,840
And sometimes means-end analysis can get caught in loops. Means-end analysis,

4
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,220
like genetic and test, is an example of universal error methods.

5
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,480
These universal error methods are applicalbe to very large classes of problems.

6
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,430
However, they can rate few guarantees of success, and

7
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,510
they're often very costly. They're costly in terms of computational efficiency.

8
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,070
They neither provide any guarantees of computational efficiency, nor

9
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,300
provide any guarantees of the optimality of the solution that they come up with.

10
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,130
Their power lies in the fact that they can be applied to a very large class of

11
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,710
problems. Later in this class, we'll discuss problem-solving methods,

12
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,740
which are very specialized problem-solving methods.

13
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,650
Those methods are applicable to a smaller class of problems. However,

14
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,770
they are more tuned to those problems and often are more efficient and

15
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,932
sometimes, also provide guarantees over the optimality of the solution.

16
00:01:40,932 --> 00:01:45,470
Although means-end analysis did not work very for this problem. It in fact works

17
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:50,510
quite well for many other problems and therefore is an important AI method.

18
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:55,320
Later in this class when we come to planning, we will look at more powerful

19
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,150
specialized methods that can in fact address this class of problems quite well.
