00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:06,100
So just to conclude I just introduced a simple concept of pixel layer blending.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,650
As actually you've seen now in the context of the videos that

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,510
you've been seeing.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,290
But again, the bottom line is there are many different techniques like this,

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,210
widely in use in photography.

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,270
For those of you interested.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,790
Just go in to Photoshop, open up the layer mode.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,900
And then, in the layer mode, when you actually have multiple layers,

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,470
there is whole bla, you know, layer blending options that'll allow you to

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,130
kind of play around and see what the artifacts of each and

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,970
every one of them, and what effects you get from each and everyone of them.

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,430
again, showcase why some of those videos that you've been seeing.

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,447
Are looking up, and they will continue to look up for further information,

14
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:46,086
you can look at Wikipedia site on blend mods or you can actually look at

15
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:51,058
the pipeline of udacity videos producted from the blog site that I have listed.

16
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:55,440
Again,ah, you know start playing around with this kind of stuff using any of

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,030
the softwares that we have provided, you should be able to do this kind of

18
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,170
simple additions, and simple multiplications and other types of things.

19
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,790
Again this was an example of us opening a black box, and

20
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,850
that's what we just did for something you've been seeing.

21
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,350
Thanks
