00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,082
You know, yes, Chomsky did look at the structure of language and he did

2
00:00:03,082 --> 00:00:07,977
believed that there was a universal structure to language. And that humans have

3
00:00:07,977 --> 00:00:12,230
this inborn natural capacity to acquire language. In fact, he called it a

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,670
language acquisition device that we're born with. So in fact, specific

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,988
languages, all 6,000 of the world's languages. Are just expressions of this

6
00:00:23,988 --> 00:00:30,532
universal grammar, and so in this sense Chomsky was a nativist. He argued very

7
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:36,450
much that we don't so much learn language as we discover it. It's natural,

8
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,270
universal grammar.
