00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,570
Today we'll discuss logic. Logic is a formal language that allows us to

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,540
make assertions about the world in a very precise way.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,350
We learn about logic both because it is an important topic and

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,810
also because it forms the basis of additional topics such as planning.

5
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:22,700
We'll start talking about a formal notation for writing sentences in logic.

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,885
This formal notation will have things like conjunctions and

7
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:29,540
disjunctions. Then we'll talk about truth tables, a topic that you probably

8
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,591
already know. We'll talk about rules of inferences like modus ponens and

9
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:39,530
modus tollens. Finally we'll discuss methods for proving theories [UNKNOWN]

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,520
by repetition. One of those methods is called, resolution theorem proving.
