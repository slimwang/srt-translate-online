00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,665
On the tablet, there's a bug 
where if you select an item

2
00:00:02,665 --> 00:00:05,512
near the bottom of the list 
and then you rotate the device,

3
00:00:05,512 --> 00:00:07,898
the selected item is 
no longer scrolled into view.

4
00:00:07,898 --> 00:00:09,674
You have to manually 
scroll the list.

5
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:12,270
That means we should store
the position of the selected item

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,430
in the SavedInstanceState Bundle.

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,230
If the app is killed, 
when it's restored,

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,153
we should read the position 
back from the Bundle.

9
00:00:18,153 --> 00:00:20,186
If the list isn't populated at that time,

10
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,630
then we should wait 
for the onLoadFinished callback

11
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,094
to use a position to scroll
to the selected item.

12
00:00:24,094 --> 00:00:25,810
Check these boxes when you're done.
