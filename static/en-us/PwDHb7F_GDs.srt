1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,620
In the last exercise,
we made GigaGal move, but

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,400
you may have noticed she
couldn't turn to the left.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,640
Let's fix that.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,150
First of all,

5
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,300
we'll add this facing enum to keep track
of what direction GigaGal is facing.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,390
Then we'll update her facing direction
based on what direction she's moving.

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,990
Finally, down in render, we'll draw
either the right facing sprite or

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,720
the left facing sprite based
on GigaGal's facing direction.

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,730
When you're done,
it should look something like this.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,490
By the way, I don't think she's
passing the cannon from hand to hand.

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,080
I think both of her gauntlets
are able to turn into cannons.

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,310
But feel free to interpret
that however you want.

13
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,340
Now it's up to you to set up GigaGal for
multi-directional mayhem.
