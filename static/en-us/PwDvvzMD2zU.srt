Thanks for your input.

Okay, so when I went through this just
now, I used the term dog sitting.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,109
I found dog sitting was most
popular in Colorado, and

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,920
specifically in Denver, Colorado.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,540
And the two most popular related terms
were pet sitting and a dog sitting.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,070
I thought the A was interesting in that.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,750
I found it most interesting
that the term tended to

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,180
peak during summer months.

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,730
So we may want to pick up our
advertising around that time.
