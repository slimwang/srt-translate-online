1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,850
So the seventh and last principle of knowledge based AI agents in CS7637 is that

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,820
the architecture of knowledge based AI agents enables reasoning, learning, and

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,800
memory to support and constrain each other. Instead of building a theory of

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,310
reasoning or problem solving by itself or a theory of learning by itself or

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,380
a theory of memory by itself, we are trying to build unified theories,

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,770
theories where reasoning, learning, and memory coexist. Memory stores and

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:32,280
organizes knowledge. Learning acquires knowledge. Reasoning uses knowledge.

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,980
Knowledge is the glue between these three. One place that we saw reasoning,

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,380
learning, and memory coming together very well was in production systems.

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,890
When reasoning failed, an impasse was reached then. Memory provided

11
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:53,580
some episodic knowledge and a learning mechanism of chunking extracted a rule

12
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,830
from that episodic knowledge. And that rule broke the impulse and

13
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,400
reasoning could proceed a pace. This is a clear example where reasoning,

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,180
learning, and memory came together in a unified architecture. In logic,

15
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,160
memory, or the knowledge base, may begin with a set of axioms.

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,520
And those set of axioms decide what we can prove using that particular logic.

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,120
To look at the problem, conversely, depending upon the reasoning,

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,450
we need to put into the knowledge base, so that the reasoning can be supported.

19
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,900
Exploration of this learning was under the place. Where reasoning learning and

20
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,460
memory came together so well. Memory supplied us with the earlier precedents.

21
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,560
Reasoning led to the composition of this explanation which explained why this

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,430
instance was an example of a cup. This lead to learning

23
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,900
about the connections between this weirdest precedence to an explanation.

24
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,170
Here in the correcting mistakes was yet another example of, learning, reasoning,

25
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,710
and memory coming together. Where a failure occurred, when the agent used it's

26
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,530
previous knowledge, memory, to reason and identify the fault responsible for

27
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,600
the failure, reasoning, and then corrected that particular fault,

28
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,940
learning, in order to get the correct model. This knowledge based paradigm says

29
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:16,120
that we want to be able to reach unified, that connect reasoning, learning and

30
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,120
memory. And this also connects very well with human cognition, human cognition,

31
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,630
of course, has reasoning and learning and memory intertwined together. It is not

32
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,490
as if memory and human cognition works by itself or learning works by itself or

33
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,220
reasoning works by itself. You cannot divorce them from each other.
