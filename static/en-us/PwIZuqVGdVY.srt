1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
A question on stereo vision.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
An object at range of 100 meters

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
leads to a 2mm displacement for a stereo rig,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
with focal length 40mm.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now we double the baseline.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What will happen to the new displacement,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that used to be 2mm,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
what will it be now?
