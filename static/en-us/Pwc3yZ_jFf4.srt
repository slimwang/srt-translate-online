1
00:00:00,053 --> 00:00:02,933
So now we can start to graphically illustrate this.

2
00:00:02,933 --> 00:00:07,240
So on the left, I have an image I of x, y.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,557
And on the right, I have the new function E of u, v.

4
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:14,820
Okay? So remember, E is the error.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,818
Okay?

6
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:17,704
And what we're going to do is we're going to put 0,

7
00:00:17,704 --> 00:00:19,035
0 sort of in the middle, right?

8
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:21,775
So this goes plus in u and minus in u.

9
00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:23,841
This would be plus in v and minus in v.

10
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:24,793
All right?

11
00:00:24,793 --> 00:00:29,379
So what if I just leave the square right in the same place?

12
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:31,712
What if I make u and v be zero?

13
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:33,360
How much error am I going to get?

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,939
Well, none.

15
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:35,694
Okay?

16
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:39,038
And so E of 0, 0 is 0.

17
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,899
I'm just subtracting the same image from itself and

18
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:44,576
that's what this E 0, 0 is meant to show.

19
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:49,777
Oh, and by the way, just showing you this little pixel here is black.

20
00:00:49,777 --> 00:00:51,135
Why is that black?

21
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:52,760
Because that's zero, right?

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,338
There's zero error E of u, v.

23
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:55,930
Right?

24
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,737
Error because it's the sum of squares could only give, become more positive.

25
00:00:59,737 --> 00:01:03,812
Right? So at zero, zero it's going to be an error of zero.

26
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:08,136
So now suppose I move my window just a couple of pixels,

27
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:11,335
like 3 in the u and 2 in the v direction.

28
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:14,075
Now my error going to be whatever it is, right?

29
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:15,909
And over here, right?

30
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,837
You notice this is just a gray value, right?

31
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:20,333
Because the value is gone higher, right?

32
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:24,768
So the error grows as I move away and just think for one minute,

33
00:01:24,768 --> 00:01:30,154
suppose that picture were perfectly gray, every pixel is the same value.

34
00:01:30,154 --> 00:01:33,401
That error would be zero at the middle, at zero, zero and

35
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:35,575
as I moved it, it would still be zero.

36
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:37,274
So that should give you some idea of where we're headed.

37
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:41,138
We're looking for points where as I move in u, v,

38
00:01:41,138 --> 00:01:45,192
I get this nice change, no matter how I move in u, v.

39
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,028
Got it?

40
00:01:46,028 --> 00:01:46,528
Cool.
