00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,030
At the core of is the pod.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,800
Pods represent a logical application.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,530
Pods represent and hold a collection
of one or more containers.

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,740
Generally if you have multiple
containers with a hard dependency on

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,480
each other, they would be packaged
together inside of a single pod.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,200
In our example,

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,550
you can see that we have a pod that
has the monolith and nginx containers.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,810
Pods also have volumes.

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,110
Volumes are just data divs that
live as long as the pod lives and

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,710
can be used by any of
the containers in that pod.

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,510
This is possible because Pods provide
a shared namespace for their contents.

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,615
This means that the two containers
inside of our example pod

13
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:41,225
can communicate with each other, and
they also share the attached volumes.

14
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:45,015
Pods also share a network namespace.

15
00:00:46,065 --> 00:00:48,355
This means that a pod
has one IP per pod.

16
00:00:48,355 --> 00:00:50,955
You know what?

17
00:00:50,955 --> 00:00:52,605
Let's take a deeper dive into pods now.
