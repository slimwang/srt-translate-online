00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now if you answered, no, my brain hurts--well, who am I to argue with that?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
But I think the best answer is yes, it does in fact work.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Even though there's only 1 update wrapper call,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
both of them happen, and the reason is because decorator becomes a decorator.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So this version of decorator updates (seq), and then this version that gets created

6
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
when we make it a decorator updates the decorator.
