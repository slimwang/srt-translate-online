1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,420
And based on what you've learned so far I would say no is the correct answer.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,430
There is just no good linear hyperplane or

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,470
linear separator between these two classes.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,950
Or put differently, it's really hard to draw a line between these two classes.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,020
But in reality, the answer is yes.
