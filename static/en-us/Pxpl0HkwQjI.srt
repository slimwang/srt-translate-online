1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,675
Now as you might have discovered,
these four- or

2
00:00:04,675 --> 00:00:09,500
five-letter symbols
represent particular funds.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,960
So VTINX is a mutual fund.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,350
DSUM is an ETF.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,630
FAGIX is another mutual fund.

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,828
You probably discovered the Bridgewater
Pure Alpha doesn't have one of

7
00:00:24,828 --> 00:00:28,160
these symbols, and
that's because it's a hedge fund.

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,780
These guys have symbols, these
short several-letter abbreviations,

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,570
so that they can trade more easily
on exchanges that have hundreds and

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:42,810
thousands of different assets
that are being traded.

11
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,420
Whereas when you go to
engage with a hedge fund,

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,860
it's just a one-on-one relationship.

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:54,810
Hedge funds typically have no more
than 100 investors, whereas all these

14
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,610
other types of symbols have thousands
and maybe even millions of investors.

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,090
Finally, SPLV is an ETF.

16
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,930
A couple of other things to mention.

17
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,709
It's fairly common practice that

18
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:14,487
mutual funds have five letters and

19
00:01:14,487 --> 00:01:17,960
ETFs have four or three.

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,790
Again, you can see this
mutual fund has five letters.

21
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,430
And this is another
ETF with four letters.

22
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,900
Okay, on to more fun.
