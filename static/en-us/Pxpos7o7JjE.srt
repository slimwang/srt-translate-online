00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,960
So polylines are made up of a number of
line segments that are drawn on a map.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,620
The end points of these line segments
are defined using the latitude and

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,030
longitude.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:14,300
Google Maps will then draw the correct
line for you, based on the location of

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,210
your camera, your zoom level,
your bearing, and your tilt.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,960
It's smart enough to be able
to do all of that for you.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,820
All you need to worry about,
is the latitude and

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,250
longitude of the end
points of your line.

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,340
Let's take a look at how to do that.
