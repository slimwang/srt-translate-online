1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,977
Two of these options are correct if a squared is the proportion of total

2
00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:07,946
variation due to between group diferences total variation should be in the

3
00:00:07,946 --> 00:00:12,041
denominator, that rules out these middle two as an option and were interested

4
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:19,813
in the total variation due to between group differences. Therefore, between

5
00:00:19,813 --> 00:00:25,211
group differences must be in the numerator. Therefore, 8 of squared are these

6
00:00:25,211 --> 00:00:26,184
two.
