>> What I'd like you to tell me now is what the coordinates of these two points

2
00:00:03,672 --> 00:00:07,785
of intersection are. Now I know that this probably seems a little bit tricky to

3
00:00:07,785 --> 00:00:11,809
do on the graph, but we can do it algebraically. So thinking about what these

4
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:15,777
parabolas are actually graphs of, which equations they're graphs of, try to

5
00:00:15,777 --> 00:00:18,364
solve for the x and y coordinates of these points.
