1
00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:03,139
And not meeting
specifications is basically,

2
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:06,958
you don't do any of the things
that meets, that we've listed.

3
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:11,468
And exceeds here is where you, look at
this, you can add collectible items

4
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:15,846
on the screen, multiple vehicle types,
timed games, so yeah it will.

5
00:00:15,846 --> 00:00:16,506
>> Levels.

6
00:00:16,506 --> 00:00:19,066
>> Levels, yeah, you can do a lot there.

7
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:24,675
To meet specifications for the comments,
you need to have comments first of all,

8
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:28,348
and they should explain
the longer code procedures.

9
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:31,518
So you don't need to comment every line.

10
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:32,418
>> Please don't comment.

11
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:33,898
>> Please don't comment every line, yes.

12
00:00:33,898 --> 00:00:38,605
If something is obvious, then there
might not be any need to comment it,

13
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:43,081
but if you can save reviewer some
time by reading something longer and

14
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:46,864
explaining anything that might
be a little complicated or

15
00:00:46,864 --> 00:00:50,128
maybe describe a technique
that isn't obvious.

16
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:55,522
Then that's great to,
then please do include the comments and

17
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:59,908
they're necessary for
the larger pieces of code.

18
00:00:59,908 --> 00:01:03,509
And then yeah we have a udacious
category that they are thorough and

19
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:05,648
concise and code is self documenting.

20
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:08,944
So basically,
saying code is self documenting is that,

21
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,758
the code is as readable as
it can be on it's own and

22
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:15,208
then anything that's maybe
difficult to understand you.

23
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,640
You add comments only in those cases.
