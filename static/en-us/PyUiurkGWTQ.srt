1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,310
But there are many different
types of DNS records.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,310
Literally, there are dozens of them.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,200
A records, the ones we use to look up
the IPv4 address of another host or

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,600
just one of them.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,140
Take out your favorite search engine and

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,910
see if you can find out what each
of these other record types is for.

7
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,960
First the CNAME type.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:25,008
Does CNAME stand for common name, or
category name, or canonical name.

9
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:28,620
Second, the quad-A record type.

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,252
Which is spelled A-A-A-A.

11
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:33,080
Does a quad-A record stand for

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,360
a cluster address, an IPv6 address,
or an encryption key?

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,900
And lastly the NS record type.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,770
Does that stand for a DNA name server?

15
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,440
Does that stand for an Ethernet switch?

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,060
Or does it stand for a network socket?
