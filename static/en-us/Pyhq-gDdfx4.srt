00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,640
A good way to learn about Firebase
analytics, is to see it in action.

2
00:00:04,849 --> 00:00:07,339
The app that I'm about to
show you is a sample app

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:11,089
that has gathered a little bit more
data than our friendly chat app.

4
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:14,179
And I'm using this so
that you can see what analytics can do.

5
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:16,609
Instructions for
following along are below.

6
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:20,800
Go ahead and open the analytics tab for
your Firebase project.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,275
Analytics data takes
24 hours to show up.

8
00:00:23,275 --> 00:00:26,550
So, if you're looking at your own
project and you don't see numbers,

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,909
you might want to wait until
tomorrow and come back.

10
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,750
Right at the top of the analytics
console is a breakdown

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,075
of active users by day.

12
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:39,150
First_open attribution shows me how
many times the app has been opened for

13
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,390
the first time.

14
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,789
Which gives you an idea of how many
devices have installed the app.

15
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:47,259
If we scroll down, and
select View First Open Attribution,

16
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,469
you can see more details
about this group.

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,450
If you scroll down further
on the main screen though,

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,020
you can see a breakdown
of user engagement.

19
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,740
User engagement gives a snapshot
of how users open your app, and

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,760
how long they spent using it.

21
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,379
If I scroll down a little bit further,
I see a chart for app version.

22
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:10,609
App version shows you how many users
are using each version of your app.

23
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:14,250
This could be a useful snapshot of how
a new version of the app is working out.

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,020
For example, has usage dropped
off since the new update?

25
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:22,979
Finally, at the bottom,
is some interesting demographic data.

26
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,250
You can see things like
the locations of your users,

27
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,170
as well as gender breakdowns and age.

28
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,689
You could use these demographics to make
new test groups for new features, or

29
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,920
to tailor your app for
your largest demographic groups.

30
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,879
You can also filter all analytics by
clicking on the Add Filter button,

31
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:45,469
which allows you to get even
more specificity in your charts.

32
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:48,429
If you're interested in knowing a little
bit more about how these demographics

33
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,320
are collected, check out the link below.

34
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,639
So, how can we actually use this data?

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,540
Well, image a scenario where,
after gathering some analytics for

36
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,940
Friendly Chat, you see that 70% of
your users are under 25 years old.

37
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,060
By adding a filter,
you can create a group for these users.

38
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,646
Do young people want
access to custom emojis?

39
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:13,955
With Firebase's remote config feature,
which you're going to be learning about

40
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:18,007
shortly, you could run tests to see how
custom emojis impact how many of your

41
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:21,010
users, between the ages of 18 to 24,
use your app.

42
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:23,987
You could then look at this
test data through analytics,

43
00:02:23,987 --> 00:02:27,724
and make decisions about whether to
add emojis to the app permanently.

44
00:02:27,724 --> 00:02:31,162
Now, you've probably noticed that
there's way more information collected

45
00:02:31,163 --> 00:02:34,140
in this analytics section of
the console than we've talked about.

46
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,539
In fact, we could spend
a whole nother weekend, or

47
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:41,669
even several weekends just on analytics.

48
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:44,559
But for now, you have an overview
of some of the information

49
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,759
that analytics automatically collects
about events and user properties.

50
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:52,549
To check out a complete list of
automatically collected user properties,

51
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,310
I've provided a link below.

52
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,469
In addition, you'll also find
a link to the Firebase help pages,

53
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,879
which include more information about
adding other analytics to your app.
