00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,310
Many of the functions we've been dealing with recently then, are rational

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:08,910
functions. A rational function is just the ratio of two polynomial functions.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,188
Let's say for example, that we have the function f of x equals x squared plus

4
00:00:13,188 --> 00:00:18,440
3x minus 10, over the quantity x plus 5. Let's just focus on the numerator here

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,158
for a second. We can factor this. If we do that, then what should we have

6
00:00:22,158 --> 00:00:24,930
multiplied together in the top of the fraction?
