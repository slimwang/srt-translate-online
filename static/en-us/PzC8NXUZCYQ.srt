All right. I'm here at Mozilla with Steve Fink, who has worked on regular expressions

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and languages and parsing, just-in-time transformation and optimizations for Mozilla

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and other opensource projects.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I was wondering are there any times where you've used regular expressions in the real world?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
[Steve Fink:] Yeah. Just yesterday I was at the grocery store, and I could not find the sugar shelf.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Sorry, that was a dream. Let's cancel that.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So we have been having a problem recently on the Firefox browser

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
where we get periodic stalls.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Often this is some event that happened--

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
a key press, a timer fires off, something like that.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We take 100 milleseconds or something to service it.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I pulled out my standard tools, which are Perl, regular expressions,

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and I wrote a little script.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's like one regular expression to identify that this is a class declaration

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and another one to find what an error is from,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
another one to find a run method, which has to exist on all these,

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
which just gives me a good place to stick my code in. And it kind of worked.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's one example where I've done this. I tend to do this fairly often. >>Excellent.
