Congratulations, you created your first workflow rule. So that events

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,870
can fire actions automatically. You've also created an approval process

00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,250
to define a series of steps that require human interaction

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,530
along the way. Your app is doing some amazing things right

00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,130

00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,050
your phone. In the next lesson, we're going to take this amazing

00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,730

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,120
it on a phone or a tablet. We'll see you there.
