00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,570
Okay, so I hope that wasn't too bad, there are only a few errors that you needed

2
00:00:04,582 --> 00:00:09,035
to spot. Lets go through them one at a time. The first one is right here, you

3
00:00:09,047 --> 00:00:13,725
can see that this is opened with an opened square bracket, but it's closed with

4
00:00:13,737 --> 00:00:18,557
an angle bracket, and this should be a square bracket right here. Now, the next

5
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:23,362
error is right down here and this is missing a semicolon after the

6
00:00:23,374 --> 00:00:28,058
first section of the for loop. Now, the next error we'd like to point out is this

7
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:33,403
if statement right here. We need parentheses around this not entity clause.

8
00:00:33,554 --> 00:00:35,098
Let's go ahead and add those in.
