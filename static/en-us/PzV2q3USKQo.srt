1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,360
Huh.
140 grams of fiber.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,025
Why would you need that much?

3
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:07,035
[SOUND].

4
00:00:07,035 --> 00:00:07,910
>> Hey.

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,620
Morning, Colt.

6
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,330
>> Hey, Chris.
What's going on?

7
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:09,960
>> How's it going?

8
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,060
>> I'm just recovering
from a long day yesterday.

9
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,350
I spent all day making this new app.

10
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:19,040
It's got a material theme, some
tasteful animations, a nice transition.

11
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,880
When I tilt the screen, look at that,
it subtly adjusts the color scheme.

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,940
>> Nice!
>> Pretty slick huh?

13
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,110
>> Yeah, it looks really good,
Chris, but

14
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,110
you know your application is
running really slow, right?

15
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,840
>> Yeah, for some reason,
Android feels a bit slow.

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,400
I mean, I think you guys might
need to tune it up a bit.

17
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,830
It would make our lives a little easier.

18
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,530
>> Ha ha.

19
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,970
I'm going to let that one slide.

20
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,090
Why don't you back up and

21
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,170
tell me what you're doing to create
this transcendent experience of yours.

22
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:43,880
>> Yeah, sure.
So

23
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,250
to get this nice color
blending happening here,

24
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,490
I have to layer a bunch of views, color
them, and then when I animate them,

25
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,100
I actually have to cut out circles,
redraw them back to the screen.

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,220
And as the user scrolls,

27
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,899
I apply this cool new animation to draw
the new content on top of the old.

28
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,690
I might even put an Easter
egg right there.

29
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,400
>> Okay.

30
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,690
Timeout, Chris.

31
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,630
I think you are violating some of
the principles of modern application

32
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,340
performance design.

33
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,780
Just because you can overlay 90
views that are animating and

34
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,640
transparent, doesn't
mean you actually should.

35
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,140
>> Okay.

36
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,610
But that's the user experience that
seems to be selling these days.

37
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,390
If it runs slow,
it's Android's problem, right?

38
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,490
Not mine.

39
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,368
>> No, you gotta remem,
put it this way, Chris.

40
00:01:27,368 --> 00:01:31,130
You wouldn't use bubble sort on an array
that's got 20 million elements in it,

41
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:31,975
would you?

42
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:32,545
>> That's true.

43
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:35,945
I'd probably use some, something way
faster like merge sort or quick sort.

44
00:01:35,945 --> 00:01:37,575
>> See exactly.

45
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:40,375
You gotta remember that the Android
system is doing a ton of work to make

46
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:43,625
things fast and look beautiful,
but you still have to live up to

47
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,835
your end of the bargain and
do a little lifting too, right?

48
00:01:46,835 --> 00:01:51,175
All of those overlays and
transparencies are beautiful, but

49
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:54,280
they actually have an implicit
performance cost that comes with them.

50
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,310
This is why rendering performance is
one of the biggest pitfalls that most

51
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,100
developers fall into.

52
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,900
>> Right.
>> They spend so

53
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,290
much time making these
beautiful visuals.

54
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,370
They forget all of the performance
cost that comes along with it.

55
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:04,970
>> All right, well.

56
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,480
But, I still want to keep
this user experience.

57
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,949
So, how do I make it fast?

58
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,770
>> Huh.

59
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,710
That's the easy part, Chris.

60
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,950
You watch some videos.
