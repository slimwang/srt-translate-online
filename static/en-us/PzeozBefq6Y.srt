00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,250
We divide our polynomial by 2x, which means we really divide each term by 2x.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,546
The first three terms would stay the same, because that's the same division we

3
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:13,015
performed earlier. For the last term, however, we have 4 divided by 2, which is

4
00:00:13,015 --> 00:00:17,424
positive 2 divided by an x and x is in the denominator. You might have written

5
00:00:17,424 --> 00:00:21,916
this as your answer, which is correct as well. A negative exponent moves the

6
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:26,884
base from the numerator to the denominator. And just like before, if we wanted

7
00:00:26,884 --> 00:00:31,889
to check, we can multiply this entire polynomial by positive 2x, and we'll get

8
00:00:31,889 --> 00:00:33,202
this as our answer.
