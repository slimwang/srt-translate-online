1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,479
And the answer is that any plan that
would work in the deterministic world

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,620
might work in the stochastic world,
if everything works out okay.

3
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:12,919
And all of these plans
meet that criteria.

4
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:18,219
But no finite plan is
guaranteed to always to work.

5
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:23,059
Because a successful plan has to
include at least one move action.

6
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:26,579
And, if we try a move action
a finite number of times,

7
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,889
each of those times the wheels
might slip, and it won't move.

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,591
And so, we can never be guaranteed to
achieve the goal with a finite sequence

9
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:35,405
of actions.

10
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:38,376
Now, what about an infinite
sequence of actions?

11
00:00:38,377 --> 00:00:42,170
Well, we can't represent that
in the language we have so

12
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,936
far where a plan is a linear sequence,
but

13
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:50,088
we can introduce a new notion of plans
in which we do have infinite sequences.
