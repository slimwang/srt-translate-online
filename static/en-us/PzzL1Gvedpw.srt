1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now I'd like to ask you to find a median for me,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
but I'd also like to introduce a little twist.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In the lecture, we said that the median is an element in the set, in the middle of the set.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So if there's an even number, it can be 1 of 2 things.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So I'd like you to give me one of those medians here.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We'll call this the in data type of median.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But the problem with it is it's not unique.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Many people prefer to use a unique median,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and to do that, they just take the simple mean of the acceptable answers for the in data method.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Tell me the unique median over here.
