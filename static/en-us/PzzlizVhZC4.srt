We've talked a lot about different
monetization strategies in your game,

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,950
but one more thing to consider is
how to make money outside your game.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,623
So how can you generate
alternate streams of revenue?

4
00:00:11,623 --> 00:00:13,640
>> Well,
you can create physical products.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,450
Things like t-shirts or toys that
have your game characters on them.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,808
>> I've even seen games that sell
their own merchandise in their stores.

7
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:24,895
I've seen t-shirts like you
mentioned and even phone cases.

8
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:26,130
>> Mm-hm, yeah.

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,540
Games can promote their own merchandise
by putting it in a game store or

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,410
even displaying their own ads.

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,720
>> Merchandise can get be a great way
to monetize if you have a big fan base.

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,980
>> Companies like Amazon offer an easy
way to create and sell merchandise.

13
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,790
For example,
Merch by Amazon is an on-demand

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,542
service that lets you sell t-shirts
with your apps logo on it.

15
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:49,290
>> Yeah, so as you're building
your game, keep in mind

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,110
that you aren't limited to end game
purchases and ads to make money.

17
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,280
There are many other
innovative options out there.
