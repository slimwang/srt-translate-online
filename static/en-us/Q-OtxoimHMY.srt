1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,367
Since the parabola is opening upward from this lowest point, when we have this

2
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:08,575
sort of u-shaped curve, the vertex is the minimum of the graph. Or in other

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:12,908
words, the vertex is the point that has the smallest y value. The opposite is

4
00:00:12,908 --> 00:00:17,463
true if the parabola opens downward. Since every point below this one right here

5
00:00:17,463 --> 00:00:21,611
will have a smaller y value, the vertex has the highest y value, or it's the

6
00:00:21,611 --> 00:00:22,213
maximum.
