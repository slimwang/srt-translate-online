00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,530
Let's apply some of that last lecture.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,458
Start by grabbing the starting code for
this lesson.

3
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:09,000
Update the list_item_forecast to have
left and right list item extra padding,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,210
which will cause it to match
the screenshot to the left.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,320
Add a dimension file for
sw600dp-port, and sw720dp-port.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,970
See the instructor notes for
the recommended spacings.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,640
Move the gridLayout from fragment_detail
into detail_extras_grid, and include it.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,500
Make a refs file and create
fragment_detail_start for each size and

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,930
orientation.

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,610
Modify DetailFragment to
load from this new alias.
