1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:07,180
Now returning to our look inside the black box, notice how we have multiple

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,950
operating systems running on the same shared

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,630
hardware resources. Now how is this possible?

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:20,480
How are the operating systems protected from one another, and who decides

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,110
who gets the resource and at what time? What we need then is an operating system

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,950
of operating systems. Something called a

7
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,340
virtual machine manager or hypervisor. The terminology

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,860
that you will often encounter is either VMM, which stands for virtual machine

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:45,820
monitor or hypervisor. And these operating systems that are running on top of

10
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,630
the shared hardware resources are often referred to as virtual machines, or VM

11
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,960
for short. We've always been using the term VM to mean virtual memory. You have

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,680
to do a, a mind shift for this lesson module, VM means virtual machine.

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,060
And each of these operating systems that

14
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,150
run on top of the shared hardware resource,

15
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,230
I'll often refer to them as either

16
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,310
guest operating systems or virtual machines or VM

17
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,220
for short. So watch out. Now, I should point out that there are two types of

18
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:29,690
hypervisors. The first type is what is called a native hypervisor or bare

19
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,270
metal, meaning that the hypervisor is running

20
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,040
on top of the bare hardware. And that's

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,826
why it's called a bare-metal hypervisor or

22
00:01:38,826 --> 00:01:42,530
a native hypervisor. And all of the operating

23
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,300
systems that I'm showing you inside of the black box are running on top of this

24
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,940
hypervisor. They're called the guest operating systems because they're the guest

25
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,910
of the hypervisor running on the shared resource. The second

26
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:02,170
type of hypervisor, what is called the hosted hypervisor, the hosted

27
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:08,110
ones run on top of a host operating system and allows

28
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:14,530
the users to emulate the functionality of other operating systems. So the

29
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,690
hosted hypervisor is not running on top of the bare metal, but it is running as

30
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,320
an application process on top of the

31
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,980
host operating system. And the guest operating

32
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,650
systems are [UNKNOWN] clients of this hosted

33
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:33,310
hypervisor. Some examples of hosted hypervisors include

34
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,020
VMware, Workstation, and Virtual Box. Both of

35
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,300
these terminologies you may have heard of. If

36
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,420
you don't have access to a computer

37
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,810
that's running Linux operating system in this course

38
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:51,620
you're likely to be doing your course projects on a virtual box or a VMWare

39
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,930
workstation that's available to run on Windows

40
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,610
platform. For the purpose of this lesson today,

41
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:05,630
however, we will be focusing on the bare metal hypervisors. These bare

42
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,160
metal hypervisors interfere minimally with the

43
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,050
normal operation of these guest operating systems

44
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:18,720
on the shared resources in a spirit which is very similar to the extensible

45
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,750
operating systems that we studied earlier, like the spin and exokernel and

46
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,180
therefore the bare metal hypervisors, offer the best performance

47
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,380
for the guest operating system on the shared resource.
