F plus g of 0 equals positive 1. Good thinking you found this number. We know

2
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:12,165
that f of 0 equals 2, since when x equals 0, the function has a y value of 2. G

3
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:18,874
of 0, however, is negative 1. When I plug in 0 in for this value of x for this

4
00:00:18,874 --> 00:00:25,515
function, we'll get a y value of negative 1. So, to find f plus g of 0, we

5
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:31,983
simply added these two y values together. 2 plus negative 1, which equals

6
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:33,433
positive 1.
