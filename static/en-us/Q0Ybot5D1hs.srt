1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,080
One of the most important parts
of programming is understanding

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,460
how to use the documentation.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,150
Unity has a wealth of
documentation available online.

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,370
It's organized into two primary
sections, the Manual and Scripting.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,400
Let's talk more about
the manual scripting now.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,210
The manual teaches you
how Unity is designed,

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,370
and it also shows you
how to use the editor.

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,700
The scripting section is all
about Unity programming.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,570
This is the section we'll be
focusing on for this course.

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,060
Let's visit the Script API
documentation.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,800
So go ahead and
click up here on Scripting API.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,870
If you look over here,

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,050
you'll see that everything is
organized into a hierarchy.

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,981
Remember that we're writing
scripts in a language called C#.

15
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:46,280
C# determines how the scripts
are structured and

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,880
how the commands are called.

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,970
And C# has tons of ways to establish
relationships between objects.

18
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,250
The Unity Scripting Documentation
is divided into namespaces.

19
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,110
In this case,

20
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,980
Unity is using namespaces to establish
the groupings of related objects.

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,130
And the top two namespace
are the UnityEngine and UnityEditor.

22
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,456
The Unity Engine namespace is all that
stuff that happens when your VR app is

23
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:11,081
running.

24
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:17,107
And the Unity Editor namespace is all
that's extending the Unity Editor.

25
00:01:17,107 --> 00:01:20,103
When you're just starting out,
you probably won't extend the editor,

26
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:23,370
instead, you'll use what in
the UnityEngine all the time.

27
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,780
Let's talk a little bit
more about UnityEngine.

28
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,067
You'll see using UnityEngine at the top
upon this every Unity C# script.

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,080
This is very important, because it
gives you the ability to access

30
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,220
all the objects in
the UnityEngine namespace.

31
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,830
So let's open up that namespace and
take a look.

32
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,550
So just go over here to the left,
click the + sign, and you'll see that

33
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,230
inside of the UnityEngine namespace,
there are more namespaces.

34
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,010
There's even one dedicated to VR.

35
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,870
Let's scroll down to Classes and
open that up.

36
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,470
These classes are the most important
objects to learn in Unity.

37
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,399
As a reminder, classes represent
what is common between objects.

38
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,330
For example,

39
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,330
all cameras have things in common which
are described in the camera class.

40
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,770
For now be sure to bookmark this page,
because you'll use it again and again.

41
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,900
Okay, now let's check out
the camera class documentation.

42
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,750
Scroll down to camera, and click on it.

43
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,450
Okay, now scroll down and
click on the backgroundColor variable.

44
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,060
See the example code?

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,360
Make sure you select C# at the top and
not JS.

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,380
JS stands for Java Script.

47
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,700
That's just a different scripting
language, but we'll be using C# here.

48
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,180
The background color variable is how
you change a camera's background color

49
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,540
using code.

50
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,890
Remember making cameras,
earlier in this Nanodegree?

51
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,810
Well, the background color, here, is the
scripting equivalent to the background

52
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,790
color on the camera component.

53
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,210
Let's go look at that.

54
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,486
So the documentation we
were just looking at,

55
00:03:03,486 --> 00:03:07,004
tells you how to change
this color using code.

56
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:10,620
And while we're here,
here's a little trick for you.

57
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,220
There's a shortcut to jump directly
into a component's documentation.

58
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,120
In the Unity editor,

59
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,780
you can jump into the docs by clicking
on the question mark icon in the editor.

60
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,040
Check this out.

61
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,730
It took me directly to
the camera documentation, and

62
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,120
I can click here, and go directly to the
scripting documentation for the camera.

63
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,870
Pretty handy, right?

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,300
Okay, now you've seen where
the scripting documentation lives and

65
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,490
how to use it.

66
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,138
You'll use this again and again.

67
00:03:40,138 --> 00:03:43,020
It isn't light reading for
the beach, but

68
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,170
it's incredibly valuable,
and worth studying.

69
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,680
Right, now let's move on and
learn about creating objects using code.
