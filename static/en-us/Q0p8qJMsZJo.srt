00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,074
First I want to generate a yLow. .nextDouble will give me something between 0

2
00:00:04,074 --> 00:00:09,000
and 1, but I want it to be between 0 and 2, and I definitely want a double.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,643
Because yLow could be anywhere between 0 and 2. Then I'll generate another

4
00:00:14,643 --> 00:00:19,187
double between 0 and 180, and I'll use both of those to calculate yHigh, which

5
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:25,368
is yLow plus the sin of A in radiance. Now if yHigh is greater than or equal to

6
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:30,666
2, then I increment the number of hits. But I want to do all of this try as

7
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:34,692
times, so I'll highlight it all, hit tab to indent, and then wrap it in a for

8
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:41,820
loop. And I'll need to actually declare hits. Which starts off at 0. All right.

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,542
Let's try this. I'm going to try it 30,000 times. 3.13. I guess it's okay. It's

10
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:53,350
not great. Let's try it again. 300,000. It's a little closer to 3.14. How about

11
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,495
3 million or 30 million? 30 million. This one might take a second but not that

12
00:00:58,495 --> 00:01:05,846
long. 3.141. We're getting much closer now, but it took 30 million flips. And

13
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:11,320
Pi is actually 3.1415 something or another. So we've only got three digits

14
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,543
correct. I think anyone who tried to do this without a computer would be

15
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:20,250
flipping needles for their entire life. This method was simply not viable

16
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,400
without a computer.
