1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,620
Returning to that question of
how can we know if a deviation

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,830
from the rolling mean is significant
enough to warrant a trading signal,

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,590
we need some way of measuring that.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,750
And John Bollinger, in the 1980s,

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,660
came up with something he
calls Bollinger bands.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,843
And whenever you mention that you
have to put a little R there,

7
00:00:19,843 --> 00:00:24,300
because he has registered
Bollinger bands as a trademark.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,015
If you don't do that,
they'll come after you.

9
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:31,245
[LAUGH] Anyhow,
how might we measure that?

10
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:34,913
What Bollinger observed
was that we ought

11
00:00:34,913 --> 00:00:39,785
to take a look at the recent
volatility of the stock.

12
00:00:39,785 --> 00:00:44,722
And if it's very volatile,
we might discard movements above and

13
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:45,922
below the mean.

14
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:48,512
Whereas if it's not very volatile,

15
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:53,622
a similarly sized movement maybe
we should pay attention to.

16
00:00:53,622 --> 00:00:58,492
His idea then was to add a band
2 standard deviations above

17
00:00:59,712 --> 00:01:02,090
and 2 standard deviations below.

18
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,200
Now I'm not going to make any comment
as to how effective this method is.

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,200
That's something for
us to assess in the next mini course.

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,706
But the theory anyways is that when
you see excursions up to 2 sigma or

21
00:01:14,706 --> 00:01:19,070
2 standard deviations away from
the mean, you should pay attention.

22
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,919
And in particular,
if we drop below that and

23
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:28,760
then up back through it,
that is potentially right there

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,100
a buy signal, because the hypothesis

25
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,040
there is that we've gone quite far
from the simple moving average.

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,040
And we're now moving back towards it.

27
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,800
So if you buy there,

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,930
you should anticipate positive returns
as it climbs back through the average.

29
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,910
Similarly, here where you see
it punch through the top and

30
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:58,270
then go back down through,
that's potentially a sell signal.

31
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,740
And as you can see, in this particular
case, if we had bought here and

32
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,770
sold there, we would've done great.

33
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,600
But if you look at many, many examples
of this, it's not always so great.

34
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,790
So don't run off and start trading, but
just be aware that this is an example

35
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:21,680
of a technical indicator, and how you
might involve it in a trading strategy.

36
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,090
Dave is now going to show you
how to read in data like this,

37
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,730
compute a rolling mean, and chart it.

38
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,150
And once again, I want to repeat
that I'm not necessarily endorsing

39
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,730
technical analysis here, although
I think it can be very powerful.

40
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,810
Just introducing some of
these concepts to you.

41
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,160
And again, in our later mini course,

42
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,500
we're going to talk a lot
about these approaches.

43
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,690
Okay, here's to you, Dave.
