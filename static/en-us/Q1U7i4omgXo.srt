1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So I predict that most people say they would hold, and why is that?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Well, under the identity function, sort of the arithmetic function,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
$3 million is 3 times better than $1 million, and so half of $3 million is 1.5 times better

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
than $1 million.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So the gamble is more.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But that's only true if $3 million really is 3 times better than $1 million.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
For most people, that's not true.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That going from $100 to a $1 million is a big, big jump.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Going from $1 million to $3 million is a smaller jump than that,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
even though arithmetically it's more,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
in terms of what you can do, it seems like less,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and that doesn't mean that people are irrational in any way.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Instead what it means is that for people, the value of money is not a linear function.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Rather it's something more like a logarithmic function,

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
meaning if you have a certain amount of money,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
if you double that money,

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
you don't get twice as much value out of having that money,

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
rather you just get 1 increment more of having that money.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So let's try again.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm going to input the math module, and now I'm going to ask,

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
what's the best_action starting from $100 in my pocket,

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but valuing money with logarithmic function rather than with the identity

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
or linear function.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Now my best_action tells me that what I should be doing is holding.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That corresponds to my intuition. That that's the right thing.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I can also ask, well, what if I had $10 million already,

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
then would I take the bet, assuming my value of money is still logarithmic,

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and best_action tells me that yes, I should.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If I have $10 million, now I'm starting to look at money as more closely linear again.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm at this stage where logarithmic function is approximately linear locally.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If I've got $10 million, I could say, yeah, I'm risking my $1 million,

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
but that's no big deal. I've already got $10.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's a good bet because if I win, I get 3 or 0--that's 1.5 on average,

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and that's more than 1, so I'm willing to take that bet,

35
00:02:05,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and I don't mind not gaining the additional $1 million.
