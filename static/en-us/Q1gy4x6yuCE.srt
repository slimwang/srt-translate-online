1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,950
One of the best parts of being a
developer advocate is the opportunity to

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:08,350
talk to developers and designers around
the world in building amazing things.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,320
And we talk about their existing
integrations, ways to make them more

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,080
performant, how to take advantage
of new services and increasingly,

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,620
how to extend them to new form
factors and more parts of users lives.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,760
And in these conversations,
I hear a lot of great ideas.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,320
Some of these ideas can be
characterized like this.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,790
Incredibly cool [LAUGH] while
also not useful at all.

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,950
And herein lies a central issue
with building for new form factors.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,400
Often our imaginations run so
far to the science fiction of our art,

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,060
that we forget to make sure we're
solving actual user problems and

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,330
then test to make sure our
solution is a good one.

13
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,030
That's why we're going to
take a few moments right now

14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,320
to discuss the big picture of design for
new form factors as a baseline for

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,340
our more detailed design
discussions later in the course.
