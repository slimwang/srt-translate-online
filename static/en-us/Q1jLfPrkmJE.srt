1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here is a candidate answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Remember list comprehensions start and end

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
with the square brackets that mean I'm making a list.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I want to print out x cubed for every x in 0 to 99, but we can get that with range 100.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But I only want to print it out if x is even, and to do that, I will compute the remainder

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
when x is divided by 2 if that remainder is 0,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
then x was even, x cubed to be less than 20.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In fact, there are only two of these 0 cubed and 2 cubed.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
As soon as we get up even to 4,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
4 cubed is 64, which is already much higher than 20.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
A very short list comprehended down from a very large one.
