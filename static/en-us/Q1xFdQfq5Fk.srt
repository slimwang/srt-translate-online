00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In my own research, I've extensively used machine learning for robotics.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What you see here is a robot my students and I built at Stanford

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
called Stanley, and it won the DARPA Grand Challenge.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's a self-driving car that drives without any human assistance whatsoever,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and this vehicle extensively uses machine learning.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The robot is equipped with a laser system

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I will talk more about lasers in my robotics class,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but here you can see how the robot is able to build

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
3-D models of the terrain ahead.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
These are almost like video game models that allow it to make

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
assessments where to drive and where not to drive.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Essentially, it's trying to drive on flat ground.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The problem with these lasers is that they don't see very far.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
They see about 25 meters out, so to drive really fast

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
the robot has to see further.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is where machine learning comes into play.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What you see here is camera images delivered by the robot

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
superimposed with laser data that doesn't see very far,

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
but the laser is good enough to extract samples

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
of driveable road surface that can then be machine learned

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and extrapolated into the entire camera image.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That enables the robot to use the camera

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
to see driveable terrain all the way to the horizon

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
up to like 200 meters out, enough to drive really, really fast.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This ability to adapt its vision by driving its own training examples using lasers

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
but seeing out 200 meters or more

27
00:01:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
was a key factor in winning the race.
