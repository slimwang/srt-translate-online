That last refactoring made our code much better, now when we remove a friend,

2
00:00:03,464 --> 00:00:08,115
we can be sure we are removing the right friend. Next you're going to implement

3
00:00:08,115 --> 00:00:11,355
the unfriend method but first I want to tell you a secret, classes can have

4
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:14,811
secret methods, here is an example, this private helper method can't be seen

5
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:18,051
outside of the person class, they are only used inside to help with other

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:24,340
methods. This one searches for a friend and returns its index. If it doesn't

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,047
find the friend, it returns minus 1. You should implement the unfriend method

8
00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:30,560
and you can use find in your implementation.
