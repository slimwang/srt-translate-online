1
00:00:00,808 --> 00:00:02,718
Now in Android studio,
you can hit the play button

2
00:00:02,718 --> 00:00:04,899
to run the app on your device.

3
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:07,949
In the device Chooser dialog, 
you should see your connected device.

4
00:00:08,402 --> 00:00:12,095
To prevent the dialog from popping up 
in future times, check this box,

5
00:00:12,384 --> 00:00:15,337
and then hit OK to continue. 
Within a few moments,

6
00:00:15,337 --> 00:00:16,591
you should see it on your phone.

7
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:19,325
On the other hand, 
as Raido was mentioning,

8
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:21,416
you can use command line tools.

9
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,945
From the root folder of the project,
use grade lw to build your app

10
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:26,366
on Mac or Linux.

11
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:28,740
Check the link in the notes below 
if you're using Windows.

12
00:00:29,704 --> 00:00:31,734
This first command grants 
execution permission

13
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:34,943
to the gradlw rappers script. 
And you only need to do it the first time

14
00:00:34,943 --> 00:00:36,517
you're trying to build 
from the command line.

15
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,078
Then you can call grade lw assemble debug.
Once the build is successful,

16
00:00:42,078 --> 00:00:47,090
it creates an APK file 
at the app/build/apk directory.

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,788
You can use adb to install the app. 
The -r command means

18
00:00:50,788 --> 00:00:52,520
that you can replace an existing version

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,547
of the app if you've 
already done it before.

20
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:58,694
For more tips on adb, you can see 
the instructor notes below.

21
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:02,255
Then you can use this adb command 
with the activity manager tool

22
00:01:02,255 --> 00:01:07,494
in order to start the main activity. 
And there you see it on the device.

23
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,163
And now we see it running 
in our phones.

24
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:11,870
Woo hoo! Fist bump!

25
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:19,746
We're on a roll. Let's go find Dan so that
we can build up the sunshine UI. Woo!
