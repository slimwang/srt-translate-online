00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,670
It looks like Maura didn't really get anywhere by adding

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,530
age as color to her plot. But I want you to

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,540
know that's okay. Sometimes when we conduct exploratory data analysis

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,210
we do reach dead ends. Let's see if we can get

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,480
any further in examining our relationship between friends count and

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,270
age by adding a third variable. Previously we noted that female

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,710
users have more friends on average than male users. And, we

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,420
might wonder, is this just because female users have a different

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,700
age distribution? Or, maybe conditional on age, the differences

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,590
are actually larger. Here's a box plot of ages by

11
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,760
gender. Now, I'm going to add the mean for

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,390
each gender to the box plots, using stat summary. Here

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,500
we can see the averages marked by an x

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,380
since I used shape=4. Since male users are a bit

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,890
younger, we might actually think a simple male to

16
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,870
female comparison doesn't capture their substantial differences in friend count.

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,860
Let's look at median friend count by age and gender instead.

18
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,660
A lot of this code should look familiar, and if it doesn't,

19
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,850
I want you to post any questions that you have about

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,680
it in a discussion. When I run this code, we can see

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,630
that nearly everywhere the median friend count is larger for women

22
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,910
than it is for men. Now there are some exceptions, and this

23
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,570
includes these noisy estimates for our very old users. Now, I'm

24
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,960
using old with quotation marks here, since we're not really confident about

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,600
these reported ages. And notice that users reporting to be

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,230
70, have more or less the same friend count, regardless

27
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,880
of reported gender. You're going to reproduce the same plot,

28
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,340
but first let's see if you can create the summary data

29
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,270
to create it. Recall that we can produce the same

30
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,240
summary data underlying this plot by using the D plier package.

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,680
We can divide the data by age and gender and

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,350
then compute the median and mean friend count for each sub-group.

33
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,970
In this next program assignment you're going to do just that by

34
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,570
using the group buy, summarize, and arrange functions from the dplyr package.
