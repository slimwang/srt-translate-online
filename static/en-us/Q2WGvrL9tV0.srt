1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,750
I know 2 4th is the same thing as one-half because I can see visually that their

2
00:00:04,762 --> 00:00:09,350
areas are the same. 2 3rd is not equal to one-half. I know that I have half of

3
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:14,525
the circle here that's already shaded. So, this little extra bit would be more

4
00:00:14,537 --> 00:00:18,625
than one-half. 3 4th is also not equal to one-half. I know that one-half is this

5
00:00:18,637 --> 00:00:23,350
much, and here I already have one-half, and a little bit more. 3 6th is equal to

6
00:00:23,362 --> 00:00:28,194
one-half. I think about moving this one piece here over to the empty space here.

7
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,567
Here's what it would look like. There.

8
00:00:30,568 --> 00:00:35,818
Now I have 3 6th, it's the same as one-half. 4 10th is not equal to one-half. I

9
00:00:35,907 --> 00:00:39,879
know I'm missing one extra piece to get to my half, so that won't work.
