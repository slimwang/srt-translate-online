00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,880
As you've probably figured out by now, Bootstrap has a lot of

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,080
really great functionality that's going to save you a lot of time.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,100
But you probably want your site to be a little bit more unique and have some

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,960
styles that are really specific to it that you can't find within Bootstrap.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,030
To include your own custom styles, you're going to need another stylesheet that

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,920
has everything you want to achieve that's not included in Bootstrap.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,510
To do so, add a new file to the css directory or

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,949
the css folder called style.css.

9
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,070
Inside style.css, we'll include the styles that are unique to our page.

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,320
Remember, you're going to want to start working with the largest elements and

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,340
then move to smaller and more specific elements inside style.css.

12
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,060
Where should you start?

13
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:49,220
Would you start with the background color, the margins or padding of the page,

14
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,390
or the font styles, including the color, typeface, and weight?
