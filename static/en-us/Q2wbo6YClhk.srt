00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's now consider linear regressions of standard scores.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Recall the standard score for x, zₓ is equal to xᵢ - x-bar divided by the standard deviation of x.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's assume we standardize both x and y,

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
so we now have a set of zₓ's computed this way and zᵧ's

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:45,000
for the equation zᵧ = b zₓ + a.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'd like you to tell me about the values of a and b.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Specifically, tell me what is their minimum value on any given data set

8
00:00:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and what is the maximum. Please fill in your answers here.
