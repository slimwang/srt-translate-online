1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,330
You've implemented the main
activity wireframe, so

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,050
now we can move onto
the detail activity wireframe.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,120
This is what it looks like.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,500
We have the date, the high and
low temperatures, and

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,010
then additional weather information.

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,030
We also have the weather icon,
and the weather forecast.

7
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,470
And these line up horizontally.

8
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,240
Build up the layout XML for
this wire frame.

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,060
Then modify the detail fragments that
you can populate all this information,

10
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,490
including these new views.

11
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,640
While you're doing that, you might as
well move the detail fragment into its

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,750
own file, so
it's separate from the detail activity.

13
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,290
Before you get started, I want to point
out that this layout has the information

14
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,960
taking up a lot of vertical space.

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,320
If you rotate your device
into landscape mode, or

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,880
you have a smaller height device,.

17
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,650
Some of the content could get cut off.

18
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,870
So think about how you can make this
layout be vertically scrollable.

19
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,910
To show you what I mean,

20
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,770
I added a couple of more lines of
text at the bottom of the layout.

21
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,680
Then I made the content
vertically scrollable.

22
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,340
So you could see all the information.

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,970
So go ahead and
make that change to your layout as well.

24
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,840
When you're done with all these steps,
this is what the App should look like.

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,878
We don't care about
the visual details now.

26
00:00:57,878 --> 00:00:59,970
We just want to make sure that
the functionality is hooked up, so

27
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,390
all the right information
is displayed on screen.

28
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,590
You can use the code snippets provided
below for helper functions and

29
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,500
strings that you're going to need.

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,950
And again, leaving a place
holder image is fine for now.
