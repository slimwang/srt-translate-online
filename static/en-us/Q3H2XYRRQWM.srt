1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,104
Conveniently, Grant just made the decision that he would like to keep the amount

2
00:00:05,104 --> 00:00:09,939
he spends on nozzles in the next month, at most $10,000. So we have something

3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:14,618
new to add to our what we know list. Assuming Grant maxes out this budget, he

4
00:00:14,618 --> 00:00:19,726
will spend $10,000 total on making nozzles. Thinking about what our variables

5
00:00:19,726 --> 00:00:24,482
stand for, which one of them could be replaced with 10,000? Do you think it

6
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,763
belongs in the spot of y, or x, or b?
