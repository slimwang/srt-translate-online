1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the correct answer, if you remember this from the browser question,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
is none of them.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Databases are very similar to browsers in that there are many of them,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and they all behave a little bit differently, and they all have their place

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
for solving different types of problems.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's not uncommon for large websites to actually use multiple websites.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We'll be using the Google App Engine Datastore for most of our stuff,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but using Google App Engine doesn't limit you to this.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I think they also even provide some sort of MySQL interface,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
if that's what you prefer to use.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The answer is there is no best database.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There is certainly the most popular database,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
which is probably MySQL, of this list,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but there's definitely no best.
