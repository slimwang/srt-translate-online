1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer is we have an unbounded solution

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
if every leaf in the plan ends up in a goal.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So, if we follow through the plan, no matter what path

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
we execute based on the observations--

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and remember, we don't get to pick the observations.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The observations come into us, and we follow one path or another

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
based on what we observe.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So, we can't guide it in one direction or another,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and so we need every possible leaf node.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This one only has one, but if a plan had multiple leaf nodes,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
every one of them would have to be a goal.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now, in terms of a bounded solution,

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
it's okay to have branches but not to have loops.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If we had branches and we ended up with one goal here

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and one goal here in 1, 2, 3, steps,

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
1, 2, 3, steps, that would be a bounded solution.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But if we have a loop, we might be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5--

18
00:00:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we don't know how many steps it's going to take.
