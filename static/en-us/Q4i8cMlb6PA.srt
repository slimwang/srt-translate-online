1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,670
Now let's see here, 10 raised to the 3rd power, that's 10x10x10. That's 1,000.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,274
The square root of 4, well 2 times 2 is 4, so that's 2. The absolute value of 3

3
00:00:10,274 --> 00:00:15,520
minus 5, that's the absolute value of minus 2. Absolute value takes away the

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,439
minus sign, and that's 2. Intuitively, what it means it's the magnitude of the

5
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,195
distance to go from 3 to 5. So you have to go two steps, you use the absolute

6
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:29,873
value, so that the direction doesn't matter. The absolute value of 5 minus 3 is

7
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:33,926
the same as the absolute value of 3 minus 5. It's just the distance between

8
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:36,973
these two values. Now, I've tossed in a couple of others just to see if you can

9
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:42,870
guess these. Min and max are the smaller and the larger of these arguments

10
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:50,954
here. So the miniumn of 300 and 255 is the smaller one, 255. The larger one of

11
00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:54,118
zero and minus 1. Well, zero is pretty small, but it is larger than minus 2 so

12
00:00:54,118 --> 00:00:58,128
that's zero. And our next image processing exercise will put min and max to

13
00:00:58,128 --> 00:00:59,360
good use.
