00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This looks like a good time to define the rest of the APIs for the constructors for patterns.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here I've defined literal and sequence to say they're going to return tuples

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
where the first element is the operator, the second--

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
if it exists--is x, and then the final--if it exists--is the y.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Those are for the components that take an operand or two,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but dot and end of line don't, so I just defined dot to be a one element tuple.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
See if you can go ahead and fill in the remainder of this API.
