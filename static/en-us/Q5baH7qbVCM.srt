1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,300
So an obvious better idea is just
what's referred to as Mean filtering.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,460
Mean is my background now,
instead of just being the last frame,

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,880
which is really silly is just going to
be the average of the last end frames.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,580
That's what it says here.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,070
And my background at time t,

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,990
is just the average of the sum
of n frames in the past.

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,625
Okay?

8
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:23,386
In which case then my background my, my,
my mask is now I take my current image

9
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:27,610
subtract off that mean and
that is greater than the threshold.

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,210
Notice we now have a new parameter,
right?

11
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,875
We now have this parameter n.

12
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,650
We have to worry about
how much do we average?

13
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:39,083
So here's an example on the same
scene of using n as n equal 10.

14
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,440
All right, so it's average.

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,610
Now you'll see, it's,
it's kind of a weird thing, right.

16
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,760
So this, this van that has you're
kind of blended in there, right?

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,480
As it averages over different places and

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,980
my Foreground mask looks
kind of like this, all right?

19
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,390
And so I'm getting this
extension of the cars in,

20
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,410
in a variety of ways and
it's not so great.

21
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,940
And the reason that it's not so

22
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,330
great is that the average isn't
really the right thing, right?

23
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,400
So averaging over all those vans

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,710
is getting me this kind of weird thing,
right.

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,090
Now of course if I averaged over 50, you
know, but then I'd have all these other

26
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,180
cars coming through,
the average is very sensitive to this.

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,880
What you can think of is that, the
background is just sort of a constant

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,060
value, with maybe a little variation and

29
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,090
occasionally, I get some
random perturbation, right?

30
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,630
Some random noise comes along.

31
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,080
We've seen this before.

32
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,290
Remember when we were doing
noise filtering of images?

33
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,290
And we were using Gaussians, etc.,
and then we put in that like salt and

34
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,280
pepper noise.

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,550
And we said salt and pepper noise,
the problem with it is every now and

36
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,380
then you get this big spike in there.

37
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,000
And in average it'll get tweaked
around quite a bit by that.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,250
So what was the solution to that?

39
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,300
The solution to that
was to use a median.
