1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is 3.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It takes 1 parameter to specify P of A from which we can derive P of not A.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It takes 2 parameters to specify P of B given A and P given not A,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
from which we can derive P not B given A and P of not B given not A.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, it's a total of 3 parameters for this Bayes network.
