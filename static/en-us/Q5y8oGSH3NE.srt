00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,272
You've written a lot of interesting programs already and that's great. But one

2
00:00:03,272 --> 00:00:06,992
capability that was lacking so far was to be able to ask the user to supply

3
00:00:06,992 --> 00:00:12,203
input. Here's how you do it in Java. Just like you use System.out for output.

4
00:00:12,203 --> 00:00:17,752
You use System.in to get input from the user. But as it turns out System.in is

5
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:23,407
not very smart and to really read numbers and strings from the keyboard you use

6
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:31,135
an object of the scanner class. You construct a scanner with a new operator,

7
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:37,318
new scanner and this is the scanner that can read from System.in. Usually, you

8
00:00:37,318 --> 00:00:40,798
want to read more than one input, so it makes sense to save the scanner in a

9
00:00:40,798 --> 00:00:46,965
variable. Here it is. It's called in and of course it's of type scanner. Then,

10
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:50,385
when the time has come to read something you call one of the methods of the

11
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:55,798
scanner class. Here, I called the nextInt method. It reads an integer that the

12
00:00:55,798 --> 00:01:00,994
user types in. And returns it, and here I'm saving that integer in the age

13
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:05,040
variable. So, you should think of a scanner, kind of like a supermarket

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,784
scanner, except a supermarket scanner of course reads a bar code. And our

15
00:01:09,784 --> 00:01:14,093
scanner here reads something from the user, and also produces some number. The

16
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:18,016
program snippet that I've written here is not quite complete. After all, how is

17
00:01:18,016 --> 00:01:22,544
the user supposed to know that then I'll ask for their age. So, before calling

18
00:01:22,544 --> 00:01:27,029
a scanner method that reads user input, you always want to alert the user first

19
00:01:27,029 --> 00:01:32,659
with the statement such as this one. The string here, how old are you, is

20
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:37,170
called a prompt string. It prompts the user to then take the next step and

21
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,926
provide an input. Note that with the prompt string, we put a blank space here,

22
00:01:41,926 --> 00:01:46,720
that just looks prettier, so that the users input is a little bit separated.

23
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,933
When you print the prompt it looks prettier when both the prompt and the user

24
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:54,960
input are on the same line. That's why we're using print and not println here.

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,023
And then, you want to have a blank space to separate the prompt from the user

26
00:02:00,023 --> 00:02:06,490
input. Here, we write an integer, you can also read a decimal number by calling

27
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:12,032
nextDouble that returns a double. And again, you would then want to capture it

28
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:15,470
in a variable. Let me demo this in BlueJ, so you can see what it looks like

29
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,890
before you get to try it yourself.
