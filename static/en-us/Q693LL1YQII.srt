1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,130
It's time to take a deep breath.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,560
We've covered a lot of
territory in this lesson.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,440
We've learned about the core rationales
for HIT adoption, and we deepened

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,000
our understanding of the link between it
and success in managing chronic disease.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,990
And how that link led to new federal
policies to encourage adoption.

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,785
We've learned that those polices
are divided into three interrelated

7
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:31,780
efforts to assure that EHRs
have key capabilities.

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,650
That they're used in a manner
that is believed will lead to

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,730
improved care coordination and
ultimately to improved outcomes.

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,470
And that financial incentives are there
to reimburse providers and hospitals for

11
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:49,540
the cost of these systems and to provide
ongoing incentives to use them properly.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,340
We've seen that adoption levels
are quite high, but that survey data

13
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,880
reveals some dissatisfaction
with current EHR systems.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,930
We'll look more deeply into why
that is the case in lesson six,

15
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,790
as we begin to look at real-world
applications of health IT in

16
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,470
the second half of the course.
