00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,288
By now you've seen a few different examples of composite functions. And for one

2
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:10,872
pair of functions we found both, f composed with g, and g composed with f. What

3
00:00:10,872 --> 00:00:14,768
I'm wondering is if order matters. Does it matter if f is the outer function

4
00:00:14,768 --> 00:00:19,025
and g is the inner function, or vice versa? In other words is the output of

5
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:23,096
these two composite functions the same. Well we're going to test that for a

6
00:00:23,096 --> 00:00:26,704
bunch of different pairs of functions. In the first column over here, we have

7
00:00:26,704 --> 00:00:31,570
what I'm going to call function one. And over here function two. For each pair,

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,649
please find f of g and then g of f. And then pick whether or not they're the

9
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:39,844
same. Now I know that for some of these it doesn't actually look like we're

10
00:00:39,844 --> 00:00:43,697
doing any math. These bottom three functions are all modeling real life

11
00:00:43,697 --> 00:00:47,615
situations. But we can still think of them as functions. They all produce a

12
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:50,995
certain outcome and I'm wondering if the order we do these actions in, changes

13
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:55,984
the final outcome of the situation. So, f of g, for this first case here, where

14
00:00:55,984 --> 00:00:59,583
f is putting on left shoe, and g is putting on your right shoe, would mean

15
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:06,204
putting on your right shoe and then putting on your left shoe. Whereas g of f,

16
00:01:06,204 --> 00:01:09,984
would be putting on your left shoe, and then putting on your right shoe. So

17
00:01:09,984 --> 00:01:14,304
again, just consider if the order we apply either of these functions in,

18
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:17,269
affects the end situation.
