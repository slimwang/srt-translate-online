1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,810
Let's go one step further and

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:05,460
add a whole new activity
to one flavor of our app.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,930
We'll make our app with a button
offering a joke, in the paid version of

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,230
the app the button will open
a new activity showing a joke.

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,650
In the free version,
the button will just display a toast,

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,140
telling the user to upgrade
to the paid version.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,910
When you're done,
see if you can answer this question.

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,510
Why assign unique
application IDs to flavors?

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:27,230
Is it because it's required,
is it to distinguish log messages, or

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,470
is it to allow installation of
both flavors simultaneously?

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,390
Pick any of these that apply.
