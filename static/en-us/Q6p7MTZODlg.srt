1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,369
So here are our three answers. We have p inverse of x equals x plus 1, q

2
00:00:04,369 --> 00:00:09,030
inverse of x equals one fourth times x minus 9, and r inverse of x equals x

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,248
cubed. I've done the work in the same way as last time including the color

4
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:18,170
change, when we switch from the original function to the inverse function. And

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,420
what's really important to notice about this quiz is that the equations we end

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,545
up with in the end. As the inverses of these functions, are the equations we

7
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:30,024
stared out with in the quiz before this one. We started with f of x equals x

8
00:00:30,024 --> 00:00:35,898
plus 1, and found that it's inverse was f inverse of x equals x minus 1. We

9
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:39,438
ended up with this, 4x plus 9, by taking the inverse of a function that was

10
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:44,588
equal to this one. And the same is true of this equation. I'd like you to mull

11
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:47,009
this over and keep it in mind.
