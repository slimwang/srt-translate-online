1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer to the first question is given by a simple algorithm.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Suppose you place the largest disk first,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
which has three different locations.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And the next disk, on top of it,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which is another three locations.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
the third disk and the fourth disk

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Then for each disk, you have three possibilities,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and you have four disks, so it makes three to the fourth.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That is eighty-one.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The disks on the left side are an admissible heuristic,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
because it takes at least that many steps

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
to move all the disks from the left-side to the right-side.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And finally the number of moves required,

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
is a little bit tricky.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And you have to know the solution here.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You will finally move the big disk once.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But to move it to the right-side, you previously moved the second largest disk

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
to the center. And then move it over the the right-side.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Which is two motions

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
for the second largest disk.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
For the third largest,

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
you'll move it four times, by the same logic.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And the smallest is being moved 8 times.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The total is going to be fifteen.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's the same as two to the n minus one,

26
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
if 'n' is the number of disks.
