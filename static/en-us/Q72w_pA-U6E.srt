00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,700
It's worth doing a quick refresher
on creating event listeners.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,340
For this quiz, I want you to add
an event listener to this sample site.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,300
See this red box here?

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,210
You can click and drag or
touch and drag it around the page.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,710
There's also a P tag right about here.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,600
I want you to change its inner HTML
to touch end only when the touch

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,540
end event occurs.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,200
Here let me show you.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,250
In device emulation mode when i let up,
you can see touch and pop up here.

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,440
And when i'm not in device
emulation mode, nothing happens.

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,180
And that's because me letting up here is
a mouse up event, not a touch and event.

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,740
Here's the general structure of
an event listener in plain old vanilla

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,020
JavaScript.

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,440
The target is the specific node you
want to actually listen to the event.

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,550
And this could be a dumb node,
it could be the document or the window.

16
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,550
The type is simply a string of whatever
type of event you want to listen to,

17
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,830
in this case, it'll be touch and.

18
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:05,190
The listener is a callback function
that will get past the event object

19
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,020
as the only argument.

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,110
And this gives you access
to the event itself and

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,800
whatever information it contains
from within this listener callback.

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,990
There's also this use capture boolean
which comes at the end of the method.

23
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,580
It determines whether you should
catch the event before or

24
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,560
after other elements have had the
opportunity to catch and interpret it.

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,930
If you're not sure what that means,
don't worry about it.

26
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,540
You actually don't need to use it for
this quiz.

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,270
Also, when you take a look at the code,
you may notice that you have the option

28
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,220
to do this quiz with vanilla
JavaScript or jQuery.

29
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,310
Both vanilla JavaScript and
jQuery are perfectly valid solutions.

30
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,070
But I want you to give it a shot
with vanilla JavaScript first.

31
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,540
Afterwards if you're adventurous,
try using jQuery.

32
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,010
Why not?

33
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,160
The two solutions
are actually pretty similar.

34
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,120
But you're only going to see me give
the vanilla JavaScript answer in

35
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,640
the solution video.

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,580
And as always there are links in
the instructor notes to help you out.

37
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,080
Good luck.
