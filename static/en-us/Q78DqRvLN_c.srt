The importance of sleep is often overlooked. A lot of us think that we can get

2
00:00:03,385 --> 00:00:07,484
by on minimal sleep. However, we know that there are serious negative effects

3
00:00:07,484 --> 00:00:10,876
to our mental and physical health, as well as our overall quality of life, and

4
00:00:10,876 --> 00:00:16,256
our safety. For example the National Center for Sleep Disorder Research noted

5
00:00:16,256 --> 00:00:21,356
that thousands of car accidents are caused by drowsy driving. They also note

6
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:25,992
that losing one to two hours of sleep per night can result in depression. Now,

7
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:28,310
these are important things that we need to consider the next time one of us

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,390
wants to pull an all nighter, right?
