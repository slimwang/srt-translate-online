1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,850
I'll start by creating a JQuery collection of all the elements of

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,580
class article-item.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,740
Then I'll call find on the article-items, and

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:14,050
pass it ul to find all instances of unordered lists in the collection.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,250
Now, I have to be careful.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:22,370
I am actually telling jQuery to select all ul's from any of the article-items.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,350
In this case, I only have one, right here.

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,940
But if I had more than one, I'd need to use a more specific selector or

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,715
filter it somehow, otherwise I'd delete other ul elements.

10
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:39,080
At this point I'll simply remove the ul and presto, it is gone.

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,460
Alternatively, according to the documentation, you can

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,660
also pass a selector into .remove to only remove specific elements from the DOM.

13
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,660
For instance, if you only wanted to remove elements with class bold,

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,700
you could pass in the selector .bold and you'd only see James disappear.

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,890
You can hit Test.

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,929
Scroll down, and James is gone.
