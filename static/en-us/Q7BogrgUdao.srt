00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,073
Let us look at the solution to our full predication quiz. We have this branch

2
00:00:05,073 --> 00:00:10,290
based if, then, else code. We're trying to if convert it using full predication.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:19,770
P1 here is set when R2 is zero. When R2 is zero, we branch to the else part.

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,300
So this is what gets done if R2 is zero. That means that.

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:32,870
We do this when P1 is true. And then of course we do this when it's not true.

6
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,000
The next part that we want to do is when should we do the if conversions. So

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,580
what needs to be the accuracy here. Let's foresee how many instructions we

8
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,970
have in each of these. Here we have three instructions with a CPI of 0.5.

9
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,820
This always takes us 1.5 cycles, assuming that there are other things that

10
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,590
can be done in the rest of the cycle. Here, when this branch is taken,

11
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:02,030
we do two instructions. When this branch is not taken, we do three instructions.

12
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:07,300
So let's split the difference and say that on average we do 2.5 instructions.

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:15,290
At the CPI of 0.5. That means that without a misprediction, we get 1.25 cycles.

14
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:21,270
A misprediction adds ten cycles. These two perform equally

15
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,310
when the cost of mispredictions here. Is 0.25 cycles per branch.

16
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,110
So pretty much, the difference between between these two is 0.25 cycles. So

17
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:38,250
on average, we can lose this much to get this to be equal. The penalty for

18
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:45,470
a single misprediction is 10 cycles. If we can lose only 0.25 cycles per branch.

19
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:52,455
That means that only one in 40 branches can be mis-predicted. one in 40 is 2.5%.

20
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:58,120
That means that our correct prediction needs to

21
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,350
be at least 97.5% to not do this conversion. If the correct

22
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:08,030
prediction rate is less that this then we a better off with if conversion.
