00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,100
The simplest way that a LAN can be connected

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,600
is with something called a hub. Hubs are the

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,250
simplest form of interconnection and in some sense they

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,240
don't even exist in networks anymore today, because you can

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,450
build a switch for essentially the same price. But

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,850
for the sake of example, let's just take a

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,310
look at how a LAN would be connected with

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,270
a Hub. Now, a hub essentially creates a broadcast medium.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,250
Among all of the connected hosts where all packets

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,660
on the network are seen everywhere. So if a particular

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,510
host sends a frame that's destined for some other

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,250
host on the LAN, then a hub will simply broadcast

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,730
that frame that it receives on an incoming port

14
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,730
out every outgoing port. So all packets are seen everywhere.

15
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,080
There is a lot of flooding and there are

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,050
many chances for collision. The chance of collision of course,

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,140
introduces additional latency in the network because collisions require

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,490
other hosts or senders to back off and not

19
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,310
send as soon as they see the other senders

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,420
trying to send at the same time. LANs that

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,720
are connected with hubs are also vulnerable to failures

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,700
or misconfiguration. Because even one misconfigured device can cause

23
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,850
problems for every other device on the LAN. Suppose

24
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,270
that you had a misconfigured device that was sending

25
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,770
a lot of rogue or unwanted traffic. Well, on a

26
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,560
network that's connected with hubs, every other host on the network

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,160
would see that unwanted traffic. So, we need a way to

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,070
improve on this broadcast medium by imposing some amount of isolation.
