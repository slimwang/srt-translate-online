But seriously, that speech was great.

>> Aw, thanks.

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,930
[LAUGH] I was actually super nervous
when they called shopping list

00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,308
I just kind of panicked.

8
00:00:25,308 --> 00:00:25,969
>> May I?

9
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:26,851
>> Yeah, sure.

10
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:28,326
>> Wow, this is elegant.

11
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:29,127
Personalized everything.

12
00:00:29,127 --> 00:00:30,009
This is amazing.

13
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:31,890
>> Yeah, it's a lot heavier
than you'd think it'd be.

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:32,499
>> Yeah.
Hey,

15
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,908
have you had one of these macaroons?

16
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:38,031
>> No, I actually haven't
eaten anything all day.

17
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:40,143
I would kill for an right now.

18
00:00:40,143 --> 00:00:41,389
>> I think Walter's at the store,

19
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:43,391
if there's only some way
we could contact him.

20
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:45,690
>> Hey, we could use the app.

21
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,860
>> Of course.

22
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,800
>> Here, get my phone open.

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,230
And I'll just go ahead and
scroll through my shopping list.

24
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,500
And Walter is in the store,
that's awesome.

25
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,080
So, lets go ahead and
add insta, delicious instarito.

Looks like he picked it up.

00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:15,843
>> Yeah, that's super fast.

00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:16,737

>> Yeah.

37
00:01:21,996 --> 00:01:22,541
>> Hey.

38
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,860
[LAUGH]
>> Hello there, and

39
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,059
welcome to Firebase Essentials for
Android.

40
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:30,150
My name is JP and I'm a program manager
for Google with Developed Training.

41
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,280
More recently, I've been involved with
Google's cloud courses on Udacity.

42
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,215
>> Hi, I'm Lyla.

43
00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:37,560
I'm an android course
developer at Udacity.

44
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,100
I've worked on developing android apps,
as well as android for.

45
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,032
>> So by now,
you've probably guessed that Lyla and

46
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:45,102
her team are the creators
of shopping list plus plus,

47
00:01:45,102 --> 00:01:48,750
the wildly successful collaborative
shopping list app written in firebase.

48
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,316
You've recently seen it in action
when Walter, Lyla's roommate,

49
00:01:52,316 --> 00:01:53,794
ordered us in as instarito.

50
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:54,341
>> Right.

51
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:55,838
But what you don't know
is how we got here.

52
00:01:55,838 --> 00:01:57,266
In this five lesson course,

53
00:01:57,266 --> 00:02:01,074
you will take on the role of shopping
list plus pluses first developer hire.

54
00:02:01,074 --> 00:02:01,810
And in doing so,

55
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,079
you're going to help us integrate
the Android app with a firebase backend.

56
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,967
>> You know, if you don't know what
firebase is, it's a platform for

57
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:10,654
building mobile and web applications
where you can read data,

58
00:02:10,654 --> 00:02:14,205
create authentication methods, and also
configure security and permissions for

59
00:02:14,205 --> 00:02:15,220
your data.

60
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,473
>> When you're done, you're going to
know how to create a app with

61
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:22,540
a backend that can support something
like a chat application or Google Docs,

62
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,749
or even the backend for
a multiuser game.

63
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:25,302
>> Yeah.
And

64
00:02:25,302 --> 00:02:27,953
I'll be collaborating with Lyla
discussing firebase theory.

65
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:30,083
I'll also introduce some examples
that you can use when you're

66
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,710
building your project.

67
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,021
>> And I'm the course's app architect,
which means I'll be walking you through

68
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,851
the code examples and talking about
sort of design issues with you.

69
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:40,750
I'll also ask you to implement
features for the app.

70
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,243
>> So you might be wondering what
exactly do you need to know to begin

71
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:43,807
this course.

72
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:48,150
Well basically, you need to be able to
build Android apps that can connect

73
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,983
to the internet and read data.

74
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:53,307
You also need to understand
the Android lifecycle in UI,

75
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:58,320
specifically responsive design, and
you should know GitHub and GitRepos.

76
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,859
Basically, if you've completed
the developing Android apps and

77
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:03,182
completed the project for
that course, you should be fine.

78
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:03,704
>> Mm-hm.

79
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:06,124
And there's actually a couple things
that you do not need to know for

80
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:06,815
this course.

81
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:09,355
For example, you don't need to
know how to configure servers or

82
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,015
do anything with backends.

83
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:12,119
>> So, Lyla, one question,

84
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:14,714
what does students want to know if
this course is really for them?

85
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:15,817
>> Well, that's a great question.

86
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:17,130
And actually, we thought of that.

87
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,769
So, we typed up a full list of
prerequisites and you can go ahead and

88
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:21,887
check out the instructor notes for
those.

89
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:24,643
>> So I think with that, maybe this
is a good time to take a trip down

90
00:03:24,643 --> 00:03:27,304
memory lane and go back in time and
see how everything began.
