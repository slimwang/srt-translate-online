00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,296
Here are the solutions. Nice work if you got even half of these right. Now some

2
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:09,560
of these might have been tricky, like the second one or even this last one.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,228
Let's walk through each of these to see how they're done. To find f plus g of

4
00:00:13,228 --> 00:00:20,512
1, we need to add the outputs of f of 1 and g of 1 together. To find f of 1 we

5
00:00:20,512 --> 00:00:25,744
take x and set it equal to 1 for this function. So, if we plug in a 1 here and

6
00:00:25,744 --> 00:00:32,865
here in for x, then we'll get an output of positive 1. Next we need to find g

7
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:40,426
of 1. To find g of 1 we let x equal 1 for this function. So, we'll have 3 times

8
00:00:40,426 --> 00:00:46,320
1 minus 5, which equals negative 2. We have f of 1 equal to 1 and g of 1 equal

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,914
to negative 2. So, we just add these two outputs together to get a final output

10
00:00:51,914 --> 00:00:57,364
of negative 1. To find the second one, f minus g of 1, we'll take the output

11
00:00:57,364 --> 00:01:02,200
from g of 1, negative 2, and we'll subtract that from the output f of 1, which

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:09,410
equals 1. So notice I'll have 1 here minus negative 2. When we subtract a

13
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:18,996
negative, we really add. So we'll have 1 plus 2 which equals positive 3. This

14
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:24,546
is our output for f minus g of 1. For f times g of 1, we'll simply multiply

15
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:32,200
these two outputs together. So, 1 times negative 2 equals negative 2. Now to

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,470
find f divided by g of 2, we want to find f of 2 and divided it by g of 2. To

17
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:45,554
find f of 2 we plug in 2 in for x. This would give us an output of 2. 2 squared

18
00:01:45,554 --> 00:01:52,564
equals 4, minus 4 is 0 plus 2 is 2. And for g of 2 we'll let the input x equal

19
00:01:52,564 --> 00:01:58,684
positive 2, which means we'll get an output of positive 1. We'll have 6 minus 5

20
00:01:58,684 --> 00:02:03,932
which equals 1. Now we're ready to do our division, this is f of 2 and this is

21
00:02:03,932 --> 00:02:13,122
g of 2. We have 2 divided by 1 which equals 2. And finally to find f plus g of

22
00:02:13,122 --> 00:02:19,160
x, we'll simply add these two functions together. So, combining the like terms

23
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,320
of x, we'll get one x and combining our constant terms we'll have negative 3.

24
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,920
So, the overall function is x squared plus x minus 3, f plus g of x.
