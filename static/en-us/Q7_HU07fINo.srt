1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The next thing is, who are my customers? Who are they and why would they buy?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And as you'll hear a number of times, your customers do not exist to buy, you exist for them.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And what you're going to do by getting out of the building is figuring out

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
all their geographic, social characteristics, demographics such that you actually could

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
draw and put up a picture on your wall of who the archetype is or who the persona

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
is of your customer, but it turns out that in most start ups you might have more than

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
one or two or three types of customer archetypes than personas,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but you need to understand them in detail, and there is no possible way you could have anything

9
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but a hypothesis on day one of who they are.
