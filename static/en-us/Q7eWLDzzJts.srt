00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,100
The graph that we selected in the last video is unlike any other function we've

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,434
seen before. And in fact, it's a different kind of exponential function. This

3
00:00:09,434 --> 00:00:14,439
graph shows another function that follows the same sort of pattern. Now, since

4
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:17,916
I've told you that the graph is exponential, we have an idea of what kind of

5
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:23,690
behavior it exhibits. Every time we add some constant amount to x, f is going

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,448
to increase by a certain percent, or is going to be multiplied by a certain

7
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:35,980
number. So, for example, if we add 1 to x here, what is f of x multiplied by?

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,230
I'll label a few points on this graph to make things a bit simpler. Now think

9
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,768
carefully about this. Make sure that you fill in the number f of x is

10
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:46,200
multiplied by.
