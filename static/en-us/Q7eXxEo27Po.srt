00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome to the first unit of Online Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I will be teaching you the very, very basics today.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is Unit 1 of Artificial Intelligence.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Welcome.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The purpose of this class is twofold:

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Number 1, to teach you the very basics of artificial intelligence

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
so you'll be able to talk to people in the field

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and understand the basic tools of the trade;

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and also, very importantly, to excite you about the field.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I have been in the field of artificial intelligence for about 20 years,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and it's been truly rewarding.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So I want you to participate in the beauty and the excitement of AI

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
so you can become a professional who gets the same reward

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and excitement out of this field as I do.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The basic structure of this class involves videos

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
in which Peter or I will teach you something new,

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
then also quizzes, which we will ask you about your ability to answer AI questions,

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and finally, answer videos in which we tell you what the right answer would have been

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
for the quiz that you might have falsely or incorrectly answered before.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This will all be reiterated, and every so often you get a homework assignment,

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
also in the form of quizzes.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And then we also have video exams.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:48,000
An AI program is called wetware, a formula, or an intelligent agent.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Pick the one that fits best.
