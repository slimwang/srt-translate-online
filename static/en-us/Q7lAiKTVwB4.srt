1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,990
The answers are B for stars and
A for both the coin types.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,650
The first example is of hard currency.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,073
The star shop is selling stars for
real money and has these fixed prices,

4
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:14,530
$4.99, $9.99.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,140
And because the prices go so
high, this is

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,020
a good indicator that this is hard
currency, that it's difficult to get.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,050
The second is a good example of soft
currency, which you can see if you look

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,350
closely is being purchased
by another type of currency,

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,730
not real money like hard currency is.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,220
The third is another
example of soft currency.

11
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,700
The coins, which you can clearly
accumulate as the game continues by just

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,450
hopping into them.
