1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,966
So for the next quiz, I've changed the Boolean formula here a bit.

2
00:00:02,967 --> 00:00:07,466
And you'll notice that none of the pre-processing rules that we had in the previous quiz apply now.

3
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:13,666
So there's no clause here with just a single variable, so that rule doesn't apply. And also, each variable appears at least once.

4
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:23,866
So, x1 appears 1-2-3-4 times. X2, 1-2-3 times. And so on. So each variable appears at least twice.

5
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:29,399
And also, the other pre-processing rule doesn't apply because each variable here appears more than once.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,232
So x1 for example appears four times. It appears here, here, here and here.

7
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:38,999
And the same thing for all the other variables. So they all appear at least twice.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,332
So we can't use the rule that we just devised if a variable appears just once.

9
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:48,799
Nevertheless, so if you look at x1, x2, x3 and x4, we're again going to ignore x5 here.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,466
Then I think it's still possible to kind of easily see for one of those variables here, if that should be set to true or false.

11
00:00:55,467 --> 00:01:00,332
Of course, this is a bit harder than the previous question, but I think you can nevertheless figure it out if you look closely

12
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,000
at those four variables here.
