1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What I want you to do is take--

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
this is the same version of the bridge problem solver that we saw before,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and I want you to modify this so that it tests for the goal later

4
00:00:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
after pulling a state off the frontier, not when we're about to put it on the frontier.
