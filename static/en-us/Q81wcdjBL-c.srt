00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,500
Every Gulp project
starts with a Gulp file.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,200
This file sits in the root
directory of your project and

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,610
defines all the task that you
should execute when running Gulp.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,460
Right here, is the most basic
Gulp file that you going to have.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,200
Since a Gulp file is
essentially a no js script,

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,320
we first require Gulp as a dependency.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,930
Then we setup a default task.

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,600
Now this function right
here doesn't do anything,

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,170
but of course you'd
have it do something.

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,620
So now it's your turn.

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,050
I want you to replace this
comment do something useful here

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,440
with your own console.log message.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,680
And when you're done, you can run it
by executing gulp at the command line.
