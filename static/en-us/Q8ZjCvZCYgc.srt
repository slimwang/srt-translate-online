00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,430
Why don't we apply Mapreduce to our class projects?

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,090
This week, we're going to synthesize all of our findings up to this point,

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,600
the statistical analysis, the data driven predictions, and visualizations

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,540
into a blog post that your friends or family would be able to read if they

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,950
wanted to learn some interesting facts about the New York City subway system.

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,860
It's often helpful to begin a blog post with some interesting, but

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,890
basic facts about the subject you'll be discussing.

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,890
You might recall earlier in this course, I provided some statistics about

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,420
the New York City subway, like daily ridership, number of stops, ect.

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,570
I'd like you to collect some statistics, about our New York City subway data.

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,440
More specifically, how many subway riders were there,

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,420
over the course of May 2011?

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,230
And how many people passed through each station on an average day

14
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,650
using the Mapreduce programming model?
