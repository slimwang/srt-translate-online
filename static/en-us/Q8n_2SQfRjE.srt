00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,227
Using each side here as the exponent of 10 to some power. We end up with 5x

2
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:12,790
times x minus 1 on the left and 10 squared on the right. That means that our

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:18,317
equations is actually 5x squared minus 5x equals 100. Subtracting 100 from both

4
00:00:18,317 --> 00:00:24,160
sides gives us, 5x squared minus 5x minus 100 equals 0. I notice however,

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,378
there's a common factor of 5 in all the terms on the left-hand side. So let's

6
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:36,082
divide it out. That leaves us with x squared minus x minus 20 equals 0.
