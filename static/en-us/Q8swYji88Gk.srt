1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,870
We've actually looked at this just a little bit before when we

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,470
introduced the notion of frequency.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,510
So here we have a picture of this, this yeah, we did have this picture,

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,470
this man made scene, all right, and here what I did was, I took the,

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,500
inside part, and I set this all equal to 0.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,300
So instead of tapering it off like a nice Gaussian, I was ruthless and

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,790
I set all of the, the frequencies outside a certain diameter to 0,

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,910
so there's no high frequency component at all.

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:36,670
And what you get, is this ugly looking thing called ringing, al lright, so

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:42,550
this actually has low frequency, but because of some slight variations in here,

11
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,520
it can't cancel them out with higher frequencies that it needs, okay so

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,860
what gets left over is what's called ringing, and

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,970
that's what happens when you clip the frequency precisely and

14
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,660
I'm going to make that a mathematically and better defined in just a minute.

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:02,560
The flip side of that, is if I remove, just those center frequencies,

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,560
and I think in the image processing world, this is what we call coring,

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,440
where you pull out that center, all that you get left with

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,030
is this high frequency bit, which is a lot like, what, the edges, okay,

19
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,980
we know that there's this relationship between frequency and

20
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,740
edges at the high frequencies is where you get these steep derivatives.

21
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,240
All right.
