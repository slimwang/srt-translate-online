00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,290
Now we'll show you where Docker
really shines, by showing how

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,860
easy it is to get multiple versions
of nginx running using it.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,978
This is where Docker adds some value.

4
00:00:08,978 --> 00:00:11,659
It allows us to run
self-contained applications

5
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:16,672
that have their own versions, packaging
that includes their own dependencies.

6
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:19,010
So two versions need
different dependencies,

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,979
Docker allows us to do that by
bundling up these two containers.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,919
Plus Docker abstracts away
the underlying OS package managers if

9
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:33,998
they may had been to learn the RPM
on Red Hat and apt-get on Debian.

10
00:00:33,998 --> 00:00:35,630
We can just learn the Docker CLI.

11
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,808
Let's get started by installing Docker.

12
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:44,470
Now that we have Docker installed,
we are ready to work with Docker images.

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,940
You can see we don't currently have
any images installed on our system.

14
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,140
So let's go ahead and

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,500
get the same virgin nginx we installed
through our package manager.

16
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,640
This takes some time to download
the image from a repository

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,280
because we're pulling in nginx and
all of its dependencies.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,810
So that the image can be self-contained.

19
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,380
We'll talk more about repositories
in the future, but for

20
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,869
now let's focus on images.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,650
Now if we run the Docker images command,
you can see that we have nginx image.

22
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,350
And you can verify this is the same
version of nginx we installed

23
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,512
using the native OS package manager
