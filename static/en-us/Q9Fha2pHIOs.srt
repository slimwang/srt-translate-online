00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,920
>> Notice that I have y and y in both of these equations. That means I can

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,249
substitute negative 2x plus 4 in for y. This is my substitution step. Next we

3
00:00:10,249 --> 00:00:15,689
distribute a positive 3 to negative 2x and positive 4, so I'll have negative 6

4
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:21,127
plus 12. Combining like terms, I'll have negative 1x plus 12 equals 10. I have

5
00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:27,583
negative 6x's and positive 5x's. I have more negatives than I do positives, so

6
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:32,511
when I simplify here, I know that I'm going to need a negative number, a

7
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:36,692
negative 1x. So I have negative 1x equals negative 2. So if the negative of x

8
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:41,672
equals negative 2, then the positive of x must equal positive 2. Some students

9
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:45,632
think about multiplying both sides by negative 1 and others divide by negative

10
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:50,288
1. Either way is correct. We know x equals 2, but we're not done. We still need

11
00:00:50,288 --> 00:00:54,700
to find y. To find y, I'm going to use one of my original equations. I've used

12
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,426
the first one since it looks less complicated. Notice also that I didn't choose

13
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:03,868
to use this equation. I might have made a mistake when trying to find this

14
00:01:03,868 --> 00:01:08,683
equation. That's why it's always best to use an original one. Plugging in 2 for

15
00:01:08,683 --> 00:01:13,183
x, I'll have 4 is equal to 4 minus y, then I can subtract 4 from both sides to

16
00:01:13,183 --> 00:01:18,109
isolate my y. So 0 equals negative y, which means 0 also equals positive y. Any

17
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:23,818
number multiplied by 0 is still 0. So, if we multiply by negative 1, this should

18
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:28,715
make sense. The point 2 comma 0 should be the point of intersection. If I use

19
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:33,619
some mental math real quick, we can check it. 2 times 2 is 4, and 4 minus 0 is

20
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:39,879
4. So yes, this one checks. Plugging in 2 for x and 0 for y, I'll have 5 times 2

21
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:46,157
which is 10. This term would be 0, so 10 equals 10. That's true as well.
