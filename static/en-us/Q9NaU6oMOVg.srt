00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,040
Here are the answers.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,840
This first sum is over all i,
j where i is not equal to j.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,059
So these are off diagonals, and I'm
asking for the vertices that live in V+.

4
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:15,320
Since it's a sum over off diagonals,
lij will be -1.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,530
And since all the vertices live in
V plus, Xi and Xj both will be one.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,740
So this whole thing basically
counts the number of edges

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,610
wholly contained within V plus.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,620
And it counts them twice.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,780
And it's also negative.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,780
In other words this thing is minus
two times the number of edges in V+.

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,770
So if you repeat this reasoning for
all of these sums and

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,030
you combine all the sums together, you
should be able to see how this product

13
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,760
is basically four times
the number of cut edges.
