1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,110
Right now we see a picture of a phone.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,740
But this isn't actually on our phone.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,410
This is pretty similar to when we
were working with the XML visualizer.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,170
Now we actually want to
see our app on our phone.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,034
To participate, you're going
to need a USB cable like this.

6
00:00:16,295 --> 00:00:20,575
Now this USB cable should fit your
Android phone, which you will also need.

7
00:00:20,575 --> 00:00:21,565
What do I mean by fit?

8
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:26,005
Well, I can pick up my phone and
plug this cable into it.

9
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:27,195
Now if you don't have these things,

10
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:30,140
there's a slightly more complicated
way you can get up and running.

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,835
Which I'm going to talk
about in the next video.

12
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:34,540
But, if you have both of these items,

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,183
I really encourage you to use a real
device, its a lot more fun that way.

14
00:00:38,183 --> 00:00:39,660
All right.

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,710
First things, first.

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,470
Your phone is not set up to let random
code from your computer run on your

17
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,030
phone by default.

18
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,410
So you're going to need to do
a few steps to prep your phone.

19
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,130
Okay, so
the first step is to become a developer.

20
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,500
This sounds a little funny, when would
you know when you're a developer?

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,010
Well, what this actually means is
changing around a couple of settings on

22
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,670
the phone, which will alow you
to access developer options.

23
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,390
Once your phone's set up, you'll
connect your phone to your computer

24
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,440
using the USB cable that
I talked about before.

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,790
Now if you're using a Windows machine,
the third step for

26
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,140
you, in Windows only,
will be to install a driver.

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,970
And a driver is an extra little bit
of software that will allow your

28
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,679
phone to communicate with
your Windows machine.

29
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,740
With Macs, this just works by default,
so you don't have to worry about it.

30
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,810
And finally, you'll install your app.

31
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,810
Alright, let's stop doing these steps.

32
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,060
On newer phones,
running Android 4.2 and later,

33
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,140
you'll need to tell your
phone you're a developer.

34
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,140
This is a pretty simple process
that I'll show you right now.

35
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,592
The way to do this is to
navigate to the Settings menu.

36
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:45,470
Once you're here, scroll down to
the bottom and click on About phone.

37
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,040
On this menu,
also scroll down to the bottom.

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,490
You should see something
that says Build number.

39
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,930
Okay, so take the build number and
click it 7 times.

40
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,090
Cool.

41
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:02,070
So now suddenly, you're a developer.

42
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,710
Wasn't that easy?

43
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,300
Once you're done, go ahead and
hit the back button.

44
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,169
Now because of your new fancy title as
a developer, you should notice that

45
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,570
the phone has provided you with
a new option, the developer options.

46
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,360
Go ahead and click on that.

47
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,530
Okay, now in developer options there's
a bunch of fancy sounding options, but

48
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,950
what I want you to do is scroll
down until you see USB debugging.

49
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,350
And then go ahead and

50
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,100
click the little check box next
to USB debugging to turn it on.

51
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,650
And say OK.

52
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,690
By checking this box,

53
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,010
it's allowing your computer to
put applications onto your phone.

54
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,010
Awesome.

55
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,200
Now that you've enabled that,

56
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,180
you can take your handy dandy USB cable,
plug one end into the phone, and

57
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,630
take the other end and
plug it into your computer.

58
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,720
If you're on a Windows device,

59
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,470
there's one more step to set
up your phone and computer.

60
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,410
Your Windows machine needs some software
called the driver to communicate

61
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,410
with your phone.

62
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,470
I'll start by downloading the driver.

63
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,920
For most phones besides
Google Nexus phones,

64
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,610
you can navigate to the Android OEM,
which stands for

65
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,890
original equipment manufacturers,
driver website.

66
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,750
A link is provided in
the instructor notes.

67
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,010
I'm going to scroll down to the bottom.

68
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,170
Here I have a list of drivers for
different phones, and

69
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,840
I will go ahead and
download the appropriate one.

70
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,020
In my case, I have a nexus phone, so

71
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,530
I'm going to go up on the page,
and click google USB driver.

72
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,200
This is again, for Nexus phones.

73
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,873
Okay, so for me, I'm going to go ahead
and download the google USB driver,

74
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,740
Unzip it,
I'm going to move this to my desktop.

75
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,410
So at this point, I've downloaded
the driver, i've unzipped it and

76
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,450
I've put it on my desktop.

77
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,440
What you need to do next is double check
that your phone is actually plugged in.

78
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,300
Okay let's look at our task bar.

79
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,850
I'm going to click on the start menu and
go to computer.

80
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,340
In Windows Explorer I'm going to
right-click on the word here that

81
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:57,960
says computer.

82
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,190
And then I'll go to manage.

83
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,500
In this left pane here,
I'm going to select device manager, so

84
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,100
looking through this list, go ahead and

85
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,180
find the thing that says
other devices and expand it.

86
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,270
Now you should see something
here that refers to your phone.

87
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,111
For example, NexusS, or ADB,

88
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:22,330
which stands for
android debug bridge, interface.

89
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,715
OK.
Okay, so I'm going to right-click and

90
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:27,035
select update driver software.

91
00:04:27,035 --> 00:04:29,565
This is going to launch a wizard
that looks like this, and

92
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:32,305
I want to select the one that lets me
browse my computer, because remember,

93
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,415
I just downloaded it to my desktop.

94
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:38,260
I'm going to do browse computer, and
I'm going to go ahead and click browse.

95
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,650
And I'm going to go to my desktop and
hit OK and hit next.

96
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,730
I might see some security
messages like this.

97
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,890
Go ahead and say, install.

98
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,960
All right.
Cool.

99
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,890
So, this autoplay just popped up with
my Nexus 6, so that's a good sign

100
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,750
that now the computer's
communicating well with my phone.

101
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,800
I'm going to go ahead and close this.

102
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,630
And the final window of the wizard,

103
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,610
says that Windows has successfully
updated your driver software.

104
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,240
So that sounds awesome.

105
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,180
Go ahead and click close.

106
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,250
Basically at this point,

107
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,600
your phone is ready to accept
the application from your computer.

108
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,470
Another way of saying that
you can now install apps that

109
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,400
you've built on your computer,
onto your phone.

110
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,408
Finally, were going to install our
Hello World App from the computer

111
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:19,151
onto the phone.

112
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,860
To do this, you're going to go
up to the top of Android Studio

113
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,220
to this green play button, and click it.

114
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,070
It will take about ten seconds or so for
the next window to pop up so be patient.

115
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,090
At the bottom of the screen,

116
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,780
you should be able to see that
there's some process being executed.

117
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,780
Now, if everything went as planned, your
computer should detect your phone and

118
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,100
list it here.

119
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,370
Make sure you have the Choose a running
device radio button clicked and

120
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,590
not the Launch emulator
radio button selected.

121
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,000
If you can't see your phone,
try unplugging it and re-plugging it in.

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,320
And then try restarting the phone.

123
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,670
If that also doesn't work and

124
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,260
you're on a Windows machine, you might
have installed the wrong driver.

125
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,110
If none of those solutions seem to
solve your problem, we've created

126
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,640
a troubleshooting document,
which is linked in the instructor notes.

127
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,900
And you can always try asking your
fellow students for help on chat or

128
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,490
in forums.

129
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,570
Okay, but hopefully things are working.

130
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,570
You can select your phone and
click the OK button.

131
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,160
After about five seconds you should
see your phone looks like this.

132
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,593
You've now successfully run your
first android application on a phone.

133
00:06:22,593 --> 00:06:23,230
Awesome work.

134
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,450
As we start thinking about our
birthday card application,

135
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,920
I want you to think about a friend who's
having a birthday that's coming up.

136
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,290
Now, my challenge to you is to change
the app that we currently have

137
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,550
to say happy birthday and
then that person's name,

138
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,630
and then to run that app on your phone.

139
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,600
Remember, you'll need to change
the main activity .xml code file

140
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,590
the same way we practiced changing
code in the Internet browser.

141
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,260
Right now the text says hello world, but
you should be able to find the correct

142
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,860
attribute to change it to say, Happy
Birthday and then your friend's name.

143
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,140
After you've done that,
press the green run button and

144
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,250
install the app on your phone.

145
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:00,750
Good luck.
