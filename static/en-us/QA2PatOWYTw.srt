1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,370
Charles, can you figure this out?

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:07,140
>> Yes, I believe I can. So, the first thing to note is that because we're

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,470
sticking with just 0 and 1, and not

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,420
all possible values in between, we're thinking about

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,920
a binary function. And the output is also

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,040
binary. Which makes me think of Boolean functions,

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,050
where zero represents false and one represents true,

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,290
which is a common trick in machine learning.

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,250
>> Alright, so and let me,

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,670
let me mark those on the picture here. So

11
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:32,409
we're talking about the only four combinations are here. And

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,330
you're saying in particular. That we're interpreting

13
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,190
these as combinations of true and false.

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,930
>> Right

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,360
>> False, false true false, false true and true, true.

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,040
>> Exactly and if you look at it the only way that you get

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,970
something above the line is when both are true. And that is called and.

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,290
>> Also take conjunction. Right, exactly so,

19
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,790
exactly so. So this is, even though

20
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,270
we're, you know we're setting these numerical values but it actually

21
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,180
is, gives us a way of specifying a kind of logic gate.

22
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,460
>> Right. So here's a question for you Michael. Could we do or?

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,540
>> That's a very good question. Or looks a lot like And in this space, it,

24
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,550
it seems like it aught to be possible. So let's let's do that as a quiz. .
