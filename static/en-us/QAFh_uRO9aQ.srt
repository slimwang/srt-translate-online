1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,490
Okay, let's review the answers.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,770
You do need to request
permission in order to read or

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,720
write events in the user's calendar,
because it's private user data.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,320
These article details how to interact
with the user's calendar on a device.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,900
The permission section talks about how
you need to declare the read and/or

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,410
the write calendar permission
depending on your needs.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,990
So going back to the quiz,
in order to play audio or

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,370
video in the app,
you do not need to declare a permission.

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,370
We implemented this feature
in the Miwok language app,

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,550
where we played audio files for
the pronunciation of each word.

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,590
And we didn't need to declare any
special permissions in the app.

12
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,050
You can verify this in
the media playback guide.

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,210
A little note, though.

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,770
This guide does point out that if
you stream music in realtime from

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,570
the Internet or
need to keep the screen from dimming,

16
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,780
you do need to request
special permissions.

17
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,920
Next, if you want to access the user's
location, which is highly sensitive and

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,450
private information, then you definitely
do need to request permission.

19
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,540
This guide explains how to get
the last known location of the user.

20
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,780
You can either ask for
coarse or fine grain location.

21
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,010
Coarse means a rough estimate for
user location, say within a city block,

22
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,060
whereas a fine grain location means
the very precise location of the user.

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,200
Last but not least, for

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,710
showing a notification on device, you do
not need to request special permission.

25
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,870
Any app can pop-up a notification,
but there are best practices

26
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,820
on when you should show on, so
you don't annoy your users.

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,230
This guide walks you through how to
pop-up notifications in Android.
