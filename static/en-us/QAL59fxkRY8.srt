1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,700
Can you tell us a little bit about
what one of these forecaster's is?

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:10,940
>> Sure, so at a very high level,
forecasting is a pretty simple problem.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,690
What it basically is about.

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:19,350
We do some analysis to calculate demand,
to forecast demand of products in

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,280
the absence of any kind of promotional
activity or any other kinds of events,

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,480
special events that might cause
spikes or troughs in demand.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,310
And that generates something
called a baseline forecast.

8
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,820
So we have some algorithms
that are responsible for

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,400
generating baseline forecasts by doing
an historical analysis of sales data.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,010
We then have a separate
set of algorithms that

11
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,450
calculate what we call
incremental sales.

12
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,830
This is an additional uplift or
it could also be negative uplift

13
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:56,910
from the base line when certain
special events are in play,

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,660
like a promotion, a mother's day
promotion that's going to cause

15
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,100
an uptake in the sale of flowers and
gift cards, right?

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,890
Christmas is going to, yeah, or

17
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,270
any other kind of holiday is
going to have and uptake in sales.

18
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:11,530
So, we tend to think of a forecaster.

19
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,990
The thing that actually calculates
forecasts as being decomposed into

20
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,890
a baseline forecaster and
an incremental forecaster.

21
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,650
And each of those things
can be parameterized.

22
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,200
And then put together to form the actual
forecaster that you want to use to

23
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,320
generate to calculate demand for
products in stores.

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,110
So that's a forecaster
kind of in the abstract.

25
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,570
It gives you some idea of what
some of the features in it are and

26
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,510
how they might compose.

27
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,510
>> And can you give us a,

28
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,250
a picture of what this forecaster is
like in terms of its assembly spec.

29
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,540
>> So, if you look at this slide,
you'll see a very simple example.

30
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,840
Probably the simplest example.

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,950
I call it the Hello World!

32
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,950
Of forecasters.

33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,840
And you'll see it just has four lines.

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,200
Right.
So, those four lines explain how to

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,800
generate four different components
that are used with one another.

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,710
In this case, we've got a really
simple one called bForecast, for

37
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,950
baseline Forecast.

38
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,180
One called mults for multipliers.

39
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,510
These are the multipliers that are used
to calculate the incremental uplift

40
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,380
when there are different promotions and
such in place.

41
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,300
We use this two components, bForecast
and mults to generate an incremental

42
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,390
forecast, where they calculate
the actual incremental forecast.

43
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,170
And then, we put the incremental
forecaster and the baseline forecaster

44
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,700
together into a component called batch,
which is a batch forecaster.

45
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,400
And so what that does, and we can go
into in a moment exactly how it does it.

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,940
But as you can see, we start with
some kind of elementary components,

47
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,240
the baseline forecaster and
the multipliers.

48
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,350
And then, we compose those with
some reusable features incre for

49
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,970
incremental, and fcst for forecaster.

50
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,190
We compose those together to make
an actual component called batch.

51
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,840
And batch is the component that's
kind of the output of this thing.

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,080
That you would then install in your
database to calculate your forecast.

53
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,530
>> So
is this the description of one variant?

54
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,240
>> This is the description
of one variant.

55
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,740
That's correct.
