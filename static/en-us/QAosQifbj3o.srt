00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,995
This is an irrational number. And because it's an irrational number, just like

2
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:09,970
all the other numbers we've talked about, it's also a real number. We know this

3
00:00:09,982 --> 00:00:14,565
because the square root of 530,000 has an infinitely long decimal with no
