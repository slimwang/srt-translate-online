00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,240
>> Third grade math. 'Kay? Exactly right. However it's unlikely we're going to

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,980
have it, we're going to want to model a state machine that has 720 states in it.

3
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,140
With state charts, we can reduce this to two concurrent finite statement

4
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,330
machines totaling 72 states. One for the hour and one for the the minutes. But

5
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:49,120
even that seems little bit over, overkill here. Resi regardless of

6
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,550
which version we choose, the resulting state chart would still be crowded and

7
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,520
not all that useful. Instead, we will abstract the machine into a single node,

8
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,860
labeled clock time. And assume, that the underlying logic for

9
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,820
computing the correct signals to cause the lights to display.

10
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,920
There are 720 different possibilities work as expected. Deciding just how

11
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,550
to abstract the many possibilities for percepts is a key skill in state chart

12
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,490
model. We can do the same abstraction on the WakeTime and SleepTime displays,

13
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,700
giving us a simple three state machine that looks like what we're seeing here.

14
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,840
Note that we have not yet labeled the transitions between the states with

15
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,740
events, that step will come later.
