00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,515
Before we move on, lets get to know eta squared a little bit more. Eta squared

2
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:09,818
ranges from what to what. Write in the lower bound and the upper bound. I

00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:13,472
haven't taught you this, but intuitively, by understanding what it is, you

4
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:16,239
should be able to figure this out.
