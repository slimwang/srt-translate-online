00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,000
We've come to the last coding exercise in this course.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,390
Now that you've got your conference central application up and

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,750
running, I'm going to show you a couple of things you'll

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,930
need to do if you want to write a mobile

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,830
application to use your conference API. You're going to need to

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,510
give your mobile app a client ID. Regardless of whether

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,040
you're building an Android app or an IOS app, you

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,830
need a client ID. And just like with the web application,

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,110
you create the client ID in the developer console. We're also going to

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:34,600
generate the client libraries for your conference API so that you can include

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,360
those libraries in your mobile application. But what your mobile application

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,270
chooses to do with the Conference API, well, that's up to you. Come on then!
