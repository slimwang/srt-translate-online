1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
So in summary, the questions you want to ask are

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,210
how big can this be,

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,960
how much of it can we get,

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,910
what's the growth rate of the market,

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,390
is the market itself declining

6
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,430
or is it in flux

7
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,500
or is it taking off?

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,200
and most importantly here

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,990
is talk to customers and the sales channel,

10
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,470
and next important is

11
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,530
you can get some pretty good market size estimates by

12
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,550
competitive approximation

13
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,640
if it's an existing or resegmented market,

14
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,370
or even if we're going to clone a market outside the US.

15
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,300
Next important is

16
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,540
Wall Street Analytic Reports are great.

17
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,480
Market research firms like Forrester and Gartner

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,070
are great,

19
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,970
but something to keep in mind about market research

20
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,310
forecasts going forward.

21
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,220
Market research data is wonderful

22
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,320
on the size of markets in the past,

23
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,730
but if market researchers were great at predicting the future,

24
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,580
they'd actually be running hedge funds,

25
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,480
so one of the things I don't accept from my students is,

26
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,980
"and it's going to be a $40 billion business in the next 7 years."

27
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,170
Well, what's its size now?

28
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,380
Zero.

29
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,819
So therefore, I just don't accept

30
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,580
guesses from a market research firm,

31
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,970
unless you've actually cross validated that

32
00:01:08,970 --> 99:59:59,999
with some really heavy customer input from outside the building.
