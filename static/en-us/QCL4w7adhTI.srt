00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,320
Welcome back! Let's connect the dots. We

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,590
started with the technical issues in the

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,810
structure of an operating system for a

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,060
single CPU, then a parallel machine, then a

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,090
distributed system. We saw how object technology

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,120
with it's innate concepts of inheritance and

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,470
reuse helps in structuring operating systems at

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,260
different levels. Now, we go one step further.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,980
How do we structure the system software for

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,850
a large scale distributed system service? It's too

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,260
limiting to call it an operating system. Large

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,830
scale distributed service. As we continue this lesson,

13
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,480
we'll get a glimpse of how object technology

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,990
has gone ballistic to provide the services that

15
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,450
you're reliant on for your everyday internet e-commerce

16
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,460
experience. In this lesson, we will describe enterprise java

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,890
beans and the term java bean is used to

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:01,060
signify reusable software components. That is many objects, java objects,

19
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,120
in a bundle so that it can be passed

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,860
around easily from one application to another application for reuse.
