00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,430
Okay lets take a look at the answers to

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:04,720
these questions. So for the first aid kit question,

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,170
there are actually 2 bands named first aid kit

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,920
one of them being in Sweden and I forget actually

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,950
where the other one is from. What's the begin

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,270
area name for queen? This is actually a pretty easy

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,930
one. It is London. Okay? The Spanish alias for

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,320
Beatles. This happens to be Los Beatles. There's actually a

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,640
BBC recording where they talk about the Spanish alias for the Beatles. It's an

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,009
interview with John, Paul, George and Ringo.

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,220
Okay, enough Beatles nerdery. Alright, the Nirvana Disambiguation.

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,670
So there are actually a few bands named Nirvana. The Kurt Cobain Nirvana is

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,640
disambiguated in music brains with the label,

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,230
"90s US Grunge Band." Okay? And when was

15
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,857
One Direction formed? 2010.
