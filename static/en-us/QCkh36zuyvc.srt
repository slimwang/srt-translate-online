Here's an example of a graph--imagine this is a social network graph,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and we're going to look at the degree centrality of the nodes in the graph.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's take a look at node 5.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Node 5 has a degree centrality of 2 which really just means

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
it has a degree of 2--there's 2 edges coming out of it.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What I'd like you to do is go through the nodes in this network and figure out which node

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
has the highest degree centrality in the network and then write your answer in the box.
