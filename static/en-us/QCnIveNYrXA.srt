1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,920
fontFamily is the attribute that
you would use to set the font for

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,330
a TextView.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,045
Since we want the actual
font to be Sans Serif Light,

4
00:00:08,045 --> 00:00:12,620
sans-serif-light is the value that
we use for the attribute fontFamily.

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,401
To make that a little bit more clear,
let me show you in Android Studio.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,920
Okay, I'm back here in my
lovely activity_main.xml and

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,180
let's add some more attributes.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,080
I'm going to start with
the Happy Birthday, Ben TextView, and

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,530
the attribute I am adding
is android:fontFamily.

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,950
Okay, and the fontFamily that I wanted
to use if you remember from the last

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:43,500
slide is sans,
that's with an s, -serif-light.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,560
And as always, it's nestled
between two quotation marks.

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,340
Now, this is a little bit hard to see,
but

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,170
the preview view has updated to show
us the thinner, San Serif Light font.

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,470
You can see it best if you click on
something that's not the TextView, and

16
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,620
sort of compare these two look like,
since this is the old font and

17
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,369
this is the new font.

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,330
A couple of things to notice, or
problems that you might have run into.

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,400
These things here are dashes,
they're not underscores.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,650
So make sure you get
that absolutely right.

21
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,350
And make sure you spelled
sans-serif-light completely correct.

22
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,100
For example,

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,590
the computer won't recognize
sans_serif_light with underscores.

24
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,530
You can see here it has
reverted back to the old font.

25
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,622
Also note, that when you hover over
the text, you might get this message.

26
00:01:26,622 --> 00:01:33,418
Attribute fontFamily is only used in API
level 16 and higher, current min is 15.

27
00:01:33,418 --> 00:01:38,044
If you remember back to when we made the
project, we set the minimum SDK to 15,

28
00:01:38,044 --> 00:01:39,440
or Ice Cream Sandwich.

29
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,180
What this is telling us is, to use this
attribute, you need one higher version.

30
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,430
This isn't a huge deal but

31
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,360
basically what it means is that on older
phones you're going to see the old

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,222
chunkier font and on newer phones you'll
actually see the Sans Serif Light font.

33
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:59,770
Okay, so I'm going to continue on and
add the attribute to my other TextView.

34
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,458
Let's scroll down.

35
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:05,370
android:fontFamily.

36
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,419
Okay, and now on the preview screen
everything looks correct, but

37
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,430
always run it on your phone.

38
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,446
I'm going to hit the green run button.

39
00:02:11,446 --> 00:02:14,250
I'm going to wait a million years.

40
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,502
I'm going to hit the phone,
going to hit OK.

41
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:20,210
All right, and when you load it up
on your phone, you should be able

42
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,210
to see that you have a little bit
of a thinner Sans Serif Light font.

43
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,380
Excellent work, two down,
three more to go.
