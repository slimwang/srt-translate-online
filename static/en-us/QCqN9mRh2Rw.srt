00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,060
There are a couple of ways
of doing a 3D sensing

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,490
some of which we've already seen.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,390
So Passive 3D sensing,
what do we mean by that?

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,540
That means you don't use
any active illumination,

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,730
that is you take the world as it's given
to you and you somehow sense that.

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,400
And maybe you exploit some known
geometry of the properties or

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,780
something about the scene.

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,360
So have we actually done something
that recovers geometry of the scene?

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,360
Well of course we have, right?

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,220
We've done stereo.

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,890
In fact, those of you who
are participating in the class for

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,310
credit have actually
matched stereo images.

13
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,590
So here's an example of
some some stereo rigs.

14
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,830
These are sort of amateur ones.

15
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,930
You know, I love this one, right?

16
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,180
Build the wooden blocks,
screw two cameras on, capture a picture.

17
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,270
Here's something a little more
sophisticated where you've got some high

18
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,290
end video cameras mounted on a rigid bar
that you can control the vergence angle.

19
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,010
But of course if any of you
gone to the movies lately,

20
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,210
you've probably paid
a lot of extra money,

21
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,190
in order to be able to entertain
your two eyes separately.

22
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,820
Or more precisely,
to see movies in 3D, stereo.

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,130
And here's the types of,
rigs that they use.

24
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:00,990
Some of you notice that's,

25
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,870
Spielberg on the right, in the middle
I think that's James Cameron.

26
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,730
He was behind, the making of Avatar.

27
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,010
Avatar was one of the first movies where

28
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,820
3D was fundamental to sort of
the experience of the movie.

29
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,450
And there have been a lot of 3D movies
before, and, obviously one since, but

30
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,020
in this non-film critic's view
of the universe, it, it is,

31
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,200
it was a seamless blending of sort
of what you would think of as normal

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,770
imagery, but
done in 3D along with computer graphics.

33
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,270
And so, the 3D experience wasn't
despite, wasn't just sort of

34
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,640
the experience of 3D was actually
crafted as part of the movie.

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,980
At least,
this is my part view of the universe.

36
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,240
And it's what it really made it,
and, and

37
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,130
the technology had come around
quite a bit with polarized light,

38
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,740
to really be able to give you
a compelling 3D experience.

39
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,160
There are other ways, also,
of getting depth from a natural image.

40
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,820
One, cool one, and we actually talked
a little bit about this when we were,

41
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,040
talking about focus pull, right?

42
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,410
Is that the way a lens works,
focal plane is actually in focus and

43
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,640
then some other, and the,
when things that are further away or

44
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,590
in front are not in focus, so you can
go from focus to depth, all right?

45
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,990
In fact, here's this cute little
animation of this scene, right,

46
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,110
where you can see that they're varying
the focal plane, and by varying

47
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,910
the focal plane you can figure out the
depth of different parts of the scene.

48
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,860
All right, so that's all passive.
