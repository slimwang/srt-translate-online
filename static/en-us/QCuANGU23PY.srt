1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,780
So here they all are, in their incredible glory.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,960
All right? So this equation is ugly.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,750
But, we're going to be able to make a bunch of it go away.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,790
And the reason that we're going to be able to make a bunch of it go away is.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,296
Since we're going to evaluate it at u and

6
00:00:16,296 --> 00:00:21,163
v equal to 0, 0 we're just going to make all these plus u's and plus v's.

7
00:00:21,163 --> 00:00:25,992
Everywhere be 0,0 okay.

8
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:28,780
Remember we're evaluating our derivatives at 0,0.

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,350
So all of these terms that have the plus u, plus v, the plus u, and

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,770
the plus v go away, and you get something much simpler that looks like this.

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,370
Now that still looks kind of ugly.

12
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,390
Okay.

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,630
Until we start to realize that a lot of this stuff goes away.

14
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,750
So first of all what is E at 0,0?

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,670
What is the error I get if I don't slide the thing at all?

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,960
It's 0.

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,840
Great.

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,790
Next, I've got this funny little term here, it says I of XY minus I of XY.

19
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,380
What is that? You betcha.

20
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,550
0.

21
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,016
Okay? And here it is again, 0.

22
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:11,890
And notice, this 0 is the one that's multiplying the second derivative term.

23
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,030
And what about down below?

24
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,250
Another 0.

25
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,888
That's the one that's multiplying the cross derivative term.

26
00:01:18,888 --> 00:01:21,630
So, when I'm.

27
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,810
Get rid of all of the stuff that equals 0, my equations become very,

28
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,420
very simple and they look like this.

29
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,350
Okay.

30
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,640
My main function is 0.

31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,700
My first derivative components are 0.

32
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,660
And these components which go in the matrix,

33
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,810
they are just these simple terms here, okay?

34
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,590
And you'll notice that the only thing in here is first

35
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,140
derivative with respect to x times first derivative with respect to x.

36
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,350
First derivative with respect to y times the first derivative with respect to y.

37
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,610
And the first derivative with respect to x times the first derivative with

38
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,360
respect to y.

39
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,870
Say that seven times fast.

40
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,910
There are no second derivatives left.

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,820
So getting ray, rid of all my erasures, we take that bottom part,

42
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,860
we shove that into the top part there,

43
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,060
because that's the only thing left that's going to be non 0, right?

44
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,590
Because this is all 0, and this is all 0 because of these zeros.

45
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,130
All right?

46
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,580
So when we do that, what does our equation look like?

47
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,980
It looks like this, all right, so

48
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,240
the only thing we have left is that the valuation of that error function for

49
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,120
a small u and small v is approximately, remember it's

50
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,030
a Taylor series approximation, is approximately this function, okay.

51
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,340
And remember, no more second derivatives, they've been killed by multiplying by

52
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,400
these zeros, we just have the squares of the first derivatives, and

53
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,579
then the product of the two different derivatives
