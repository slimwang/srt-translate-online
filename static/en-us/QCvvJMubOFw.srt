1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,560
All right, the answer for this one.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,840
Let's look at the correspondences.

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,900
I need this point.

4
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,150
I need that again also.

5
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,740
That will get me the translation.

6
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,490
But this time around,
I have to also model this.

7
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,520
So I'll actually also
need another point.

8
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,830
So basically, we would need 2 points for
correspondences.

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,110
And how many degrees of freedom?

10
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,260
Well I need to know tx, ty.

11
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,100
And if I know theta, I should be
able to compute all of these, right?

12
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,814
So the answers would of course, here
would be, I would need to know tx, ty,

13
00:00:28,814 --> 00:00:33,750
and then of course the cosines and
sines would show up with the theta.

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,900
So I need to know theta, tx and ty and

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,480
I can actually fill this out,
to be able to get the answers I want.

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,460
And these would be 0, 0.
