1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,469
Here's the send
notification helper method.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,760
This method takes our string,
and turns it into a notification,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,960
as we saw demonstrated earlier on.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,220
I'm not going to through all the ins and
outs of creating a notification.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,480
You should have covered that already
in the Android fundamentals class, or

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,090
you can just use this source code,
and check the Google developer

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,930
documentation for details on how to
built notifications for yourself.

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,660
The important thing to take
a look at here are as follows.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,350
First of all you'll notice that the send
notification takes in notification

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,720
detail string as a parameter.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,510
Then, when it creates the notification,
if I just scroll up a little bit,

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,920
we'll see in the builder for

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,984
the notification, the set content title
becomes our notification details.

14
00:00:40,984 --> 00:00:45,840
Our set content text becomes click
notification to return to the app, and

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,450
our intent becomes the notification
pending intent itself, and

16
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,830
as a result this is all we have to do.

17
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,980
It's a standard notification
that we actually build.

18
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,350
We're just sending the text to this
of the notification details, and

19
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,040
the notification details is what
you just built earlier on where you

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,980
had a list of the action followed by all
of the IDs that triggered that action.

21
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,950
So, when I demonstrated it earlier on,
I had a geo fence called udacity, and

22
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,250
when I triggered that by entering
within one mile of udacity,

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,410
it just showed entered udacity, and

24
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,500
that's what was sent here in the sent
content title, the notification details.

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,460
So, this is all it takes.

26
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,600
It's a standard notification builder.

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,210
Again, if you're not familiar with this,
check the documentation on

28
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,750
notification builders, or check
the underwrite fundamentals courses, or

29
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,590
just use this code and dissect it.

30
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,280
You'll see the links in
the speaker notes below.
