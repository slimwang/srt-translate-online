00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,408
Answer choice e is correct here. Great job if you're figuring out the meaning of

2
00:00:04,408 --> 00:00:08,747
negative exponents. We know negative exponents would give us the reciprocal of

3
00:00:08,747 --> 00:00:12,962
the base, and then we change each negative exponent to it's positive form. In

4
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:17,102
the end, I'll have 7 times 4 times 1, which is just 7, over x squared times y

5
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:22,451
cubed. And again, our negative exponents move the bases to the denominator with

6
00:00:22,451 --> 00:00:23,945
positive exponents.
