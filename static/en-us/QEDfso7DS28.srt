1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,640
So in this case, the feature worked
great in development and testing, but

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,680
those environments
didn't match production.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,210
The firewall rules are an important
part of the production system.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,140
They're what's keeping it running, but

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,320
they aren't represented in
the development environment.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,720
So that's one problem.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,350
However, it wasn't really
a performance problem.

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,160
So this one's not a right answer.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,440
Rather it was a bug that never got
addressed by developers because

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,040
an operational fix that was meant
to be temporary relieved the pain,

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,740
made it not urgent anymore.

12
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,370
Now, firewalls are actually
a pretty good tool.

13
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,870
So, number four here is not correct.

14
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,930
And properly fixing this
problem in both the short and

15
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,070
the long term required both ops and
dev skill sets.

16
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,370
So this last one isn't right either.

17
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,590
So to recap, the problem was that ops
correctly deployed a workaround, but

18
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,550
as a consequence the bug
was never actually fixed.

19
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,190
And the change that ops made to
the production environment was never

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,460
reflected in the development
environment.

21
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,230
So developers and

22
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,030
testers didn't notice that their new
feature wouldn't work in production.
