00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,470
Recall how we determine the midpoint between two points. Our x coordinate is

2
00:00:05,482 --> 00:00:11,095
found by adding the two x coordinates and diving by two, and the y coordinate is

3
00:00:11,107 --> 00:00:16,560
found by adding the two y coordinates and dividing by two. Once we plug in our

4
00:00:16,572 --> 00:00:22,020
points, we obtain a midpoint of three halves and nine halves.
