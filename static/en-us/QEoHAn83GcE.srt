00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,828
So, as we decided in an earlier quiz, we're going to divide the search engine

2
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:08,170
code into two modules. One corresponds to the things that we do before, one of

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,720
which is about building the corpus, this is all the things that we can do before

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,234
a search query comes in. Another one is the code for all the things that we do

5
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:21,290
after a query. I'm going to give those names. We'll call the first module,

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,684
crawler, since what is does is crawls the web and builds a corpus. This also

7
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:29,950
includes the page ranking which we might think could be a separate module.

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,620
That's something we can do after we finish the crawl. For now, we'll keep that

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,950
in the crawler module. And we'll call the other module search.py. Once we've

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,250
divided code into modules like this, well, we shouldn't need to worry about all

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,210
these details anymore. So, for now, we're going to assume we don't need any of

12
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,760
those and we'll give these modules names. The first one we'll call crawler and

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,523
we'll put it in a file called crawler.py. And the second one we'll call search,

14
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:59,139
and we'll put it in the file search.py. We're going to need to know something

15
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:01,733
more about these, and that's what the next quiz is going to get at.
