00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,660
Nice work.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,450
In this section, you've learned
what a Progressive Web App is, and

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,250
why it's a great solution for
your users.

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,600
Whether they're connecting with
a fast fiber connection, or

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,580
on a slow 2G connection.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,340
But more importantly, you've started
building a Progressive Web App.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,200
You've used the App Shell model to
separate the app from the content, and

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,930
you've weighed the pros and
cons of different storage techniques

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,815
to store user preferences like the list
of cities the user cares about.

10
00:00:33,815 --> 00:00:38,715
In the next section, you'll be adding a
service worker to cash your up shell and

11
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:43,155
the weather forecast data, ensuring
that your app is blazing fast and

12
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:44,705
works offline.

13
00:00:44,705 --> 00:00:45,305
See you then.
