00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's summarize what we've learned in the form of a little quiz on Graph SLAM.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Check this box if Graph SLAM seem to be all about local constraints.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
They require multiplications--if that's true check the box over here.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The require additions--check this box if this is correct or none of the above.
