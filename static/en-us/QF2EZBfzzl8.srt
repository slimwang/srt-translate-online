Welcome back to computer vision.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,650
today, we're going to continue talking more about filtering and

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,540
sort of finish up the basics about that, so

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,620
then next time, we can apply that to more complicated uses of filtering.

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,650
And we're going to start by developing some linear intuition.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,460
And the reason linearity is important will become clear in a minute.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,650
Let's do a little intuition.

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,950
So an operator, we'll call it H,

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,250
or a system, is called linear if two properties hold.

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,150
And for what I'm going to show now both f1 and f2 are going to be functions, and

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,890
a is going to be a constant.

12
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,310
So the first property is called additivity,

13
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,810
which is basically just that the things sum.

14
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:44,010
So if I have some operator, and I apply that to the sum of the two functions,

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,310
f1 plus f2, I just get the sum of the operator applied to each of the function,

16
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,830
looks a lot like the distributive law of addition and

17
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,210
multiplication, but that's additivity.

18
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,770
And the other one, which is sometimes called scaling property, but

19
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,230
is actually technical term I think is homogeneity of degree 1, is just that if

20
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,489
you multiply your function, in this case, f again, by a constant a, and

21
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,110
then apply H, what you get is a times H applied to f1, and so when you

22
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,290
multiply by a constant, that constant just propagates through in a linear way.

23
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,830
We do some multiplication, and then we sum them, and because multiplication and

24
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,440
addition both have these properties basically,

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,790
the filtering operations we're going to do are going to be linear.

26
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,630
And we're going to take advantage of that later.
