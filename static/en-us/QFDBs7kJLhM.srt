1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to the second office hours. I have Sebastian here and myself.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We're going to do this the same way we did last time.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
First we're going to talk about some content,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and then we're going to go into some applications,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
referring mostly to Kalman filters but also talking a little bit about Stanley and Junior.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Okay, what's the first question?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The first question--both of the content questions actually have to do with linear algebra.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
When we were talking about this state transition matrix F,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
we have this equation x' equals f times x plus U.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You said that this U is the motion,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but the motion seemed to be embedded in this F matrix in that

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the velocity was taken from the state with the F matrix.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What exactly is going on with U?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
U allows you to apply a choice like when we just said

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the position is a function of velocity that's describing physics

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
but doesn't give you a choice.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
When you want to insert a choice into the system, like for example,

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
you might want to change accelerations and that affects velocity and affects state.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That choice is expressed with the vector U

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We didn't really use it because we were tracking things.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We didn't know how they were being actuated, so we set U to zero in our example.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But if you have control over the system you're trying to track

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and you can insert like a motion yourself, then you use the vector U.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Interesting--just one other piece of intuition we're hoping to get is

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
a lot of the matrices we talked about either didn't have off-diagonal elements

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
or we at least didn't initialize any off-diagonal elements.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Specifically, in the covariance matrix and the r matrix,

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
can you give us some intuition about what those off-diagonal elements would represent?

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We actually ran into an example that did have off-diagonal elements.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We didn't initialize it, but then the velocity became correlated with the position,

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and we realized the faster we moved the further we are to the right.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That was expressed by an off-diagonal element.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
They turn into correlations, so the largest these elements are,

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
the more 2 variables are actually correlated.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The more knowledge about one variable correlates itself with another variable.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Now, let's get into some of the applications that the students seem especially interested in.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Specifically, this r matrix. Where does it come from? How do we get it in real life?

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What are we doing with our sensors?

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So the noise matrices express how noisy your sensor is,

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and at first approximation you'd say let's just measure

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
what the variation of the measurement is and then plug it in.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But because these filters, a very subtle thing, assume conditional independence,

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
they assume that noise is independent from one type to the next whereas in reality it isn't.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Typically you start with a very large value, and you look a the result,

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and if the result looks good to you, you leave it that way.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Unfortunately, there is no good science for it.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Awhile back, together with Andrew Ng, I published a paper

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
on how to learn the noise matrix, but that goes way beyond this class.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You mentioned that Stanley and Junior both use laser and radar.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Does each one offer something unique or are the both just doing the same thing?

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Either way, how do we incorporate measurements from 2 sources into our Kalman filter?

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
These are two questions.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
First of all, laser and radar at first approximation do the same thing.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They measure how far things are away.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Radar also measures how fast they're moving for the Doppler effect,

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
but their characteristics are very different. They measure different things.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There are certain things that can only be measured by laser, others just by radar.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In fact, laser tends to have much higher spatial resolution,

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
but events become foggy.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The wavelength of light tends not to be as good as a radar wavelength.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So they're somewhat complementary.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
To incorporate both, Bayes rule allows you to incorporate sensor measurements one after another.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If you have a laser and a radar, you just multiply both of them in, and that's just fine.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay, great.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The top-rated question, actually, was about

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
the programming languages used in Stanley and Junior.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Was it Python? Was it something else? >>It was not Python, honestly. >>Okay.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
At the time, we started out with C, but then C++ became very popular. I was popular.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And it was the better choice, so almost all the code is written in C++/

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
How do you make that decision when you're starting a project this big? Is there debate?

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
There is always debate.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The beauty of C++ is it is very efficient in execution,

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and when you use it right it can be very powerful. If you don't abuse it.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It has way too many things built in, but some of the things like the classes are just really, really good.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Then you hire people, and you work with students, and some of them like Java,

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
so they write their code in Java, and others like C++ or Python or Ruby on Rails.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Then you just bring all the stuff together.

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay--thinking of Stanley and Junior,

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
what were the major hardware and software differences between the two vehicles?

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Stanley had about 6 embedded processors.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Junior had 2 PCs with quad cores so there was a more integrated system.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The biggest difference in the hardware was really the sensors.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Stanley had very, very cheap and simple laser-range finders as the main sensor.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We did have radars. We didn't use them much.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Whereas Junior had a much more ranging sensor suite.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Junior could look in all directions--we call this "surround sensing"--

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
whereas Stanley could only look straight ahead.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So that thing we saw spinning on the top of Stanley, that was the laser-range finder?

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What you saw spinning on the top of Stanley was actually on Junior.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That was on Junior--okay.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah, you never saw anything on Stanley, because there's nothing spinning there.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That was on Junior, and that was a laser-range finder.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Right, and that one spins because it looks in all directions.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That was important for city driving because what's behind you actually matters in cities

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
whereas if you drive in desert terrain there is no traffic. You don't have to look back.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's a good segue into the next question, which is what's the next big challenge?

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We've done deserts. We've done urban driving.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The next challenge is it'll take over our cars.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Basically get this technology into every single car and make sure driving is safe.

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Every person has a special button that says, like I explained, my little chauffeur button.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I want to just drive automatically,

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and then I'm just going to get home without having to pay attention.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Finally, how comfortable is it?

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Do these cars drive similar to the way you or I would drive?

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
When we first started out, I would say the driving is effective but not elegant.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You would get in the car, and you'd know exactly what I mean.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The steering wheel would go like this all the time, and it would make a lot of noise.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It was pretty clear you were inside a robot.

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
On the outside it looked pretty great, but on the inside it didn't.

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But as things moved on, if you get into a Google car right now,

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
you won't be able to distinguish from a human driver. It's really rock solid.

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The steering wheel stays like this, but it turns it confidently drags it around,

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
moves the right direction, comes back. It's actually come a long way.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
To get from what you said to where we are now--was it low-pass filtering?

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We will have a class on control,

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
and the control techniques ended up to be very sophisticated but also very, very good.

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
All the motion of the steering wheel are all related to inaccuracies.

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
They came from multiple sources.

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Some of it was that we weren't processing our GPS date good enough yet to map data.

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Some of it was the map resolution--like if you have a 10-15 cm grid cell

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and your estimate jumps from 1 grid cell to the next or your particle filter jumps a little bit around.

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
They might not look dramatic on a screen, but if you turned to steering motion

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
in your steering wheel, it goes by 2 or 3 or 4 degrees. That's really bad.

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We had a sensor that tracks that angle of the steering wheel and the spatial resolution was about a degree.

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That means you couldn't quite know what the angle was,

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
so you would drive a little blind--like up to a degree.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
A degree of steering wheel doesn't sound like much, but it's actually a lot.

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You can try this out.

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If you drive a car and you only move it by a degree, you feel a noticeable effect.

130
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You'd find out after a while we'll actually pulling in this direction. Let's drag it back.

131
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And all that stuff we kind of fixed.

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So we'll learn about that in, I think, Unit 5? PIT controllers? >>Yep.

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Excellent. I can't wait. >> All right. >>Thanks a lot. >>All right. Take care.
