00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,640
Here's our change of base formula again. And if we use that, we can convert log

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,640
base 5 of 9 to equal log base 10 of 9, over log base 10 of 5. This is

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,640
calculator appropriate, so let's plug it in. Log base 10 of 9 divided by log

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,860
base 10 of 5 is equal to this decimal. This is great. Now we know how to find a

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,459
number that pretty much any log expression with numbers is equal to.
