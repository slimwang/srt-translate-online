1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:07,240
The Internet and the World Wide Web and intimately tied to everyday lives. It

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,410
has put information that we seek at

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,790
our finger tips. Remedies for the common cold,

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,990
dinner recipes, sports updates, developments in the

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,330
Middle East, you name it. You will find

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:25,630
it on the internet. We know that the creation of such content happens from the

7
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:32,200
basement of individuals like you and me, as well as businesses such as CNN,

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,700
BBC, and NBC who's work it is to create such content. How is the content in

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,530
the internet stored and distributed? In the

10
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,160
first two lessons of this module, we looked

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,230
at the server end of the giant

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,640
scale services. How's a computational resources organized in

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,760
the data center? How is the data

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,310
organized internally in the computational. Nodes of

15
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,540
the cluster. And what is the programming

16
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,890
model for dealing with the big data associated

17
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,830
with giant scale services and for exploiting

18
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,760
all the computational resources that are available in

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,180
the server forms and data centers. In

20
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,520
this lesson, we'll look at content distribution networks.

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,220
That is How is information organized, located, and distributed

22
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,670
when we're looking for them? Once again, the issue is dealing with

23
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,180
the scale of the problem. The content is generated worldwide

24
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,800
and users are trying to access the content worldwide as well.
