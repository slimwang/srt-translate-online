Alright. The common denominator is going to be 24. Here's how we can figure that

2
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:11,900
out. I can start by listing my denominators, and then I can list the multiples

3
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:17,640
of 6 and the multiples of 8. So, I have 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36. For 8, I have

4
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:23,443
16, 24, 32, and 40. I can see that the lowest common number is 24. Both 6 and 8

5
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:28,059
go into 24. Here's what it would look like if you use the factor tree method. I

6
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:32,567
know the common factors for 6 and 8 are 2, and that the other factor of 6 is 3,

7
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:37,271
because 3 times 2 is 6. For 8, the other factor has to be 4. I know this because

8
00:00:37,283 --> 00:00:41,766
2 times 4 is 8. If I multiply these factors together, I get 3 times 2, which is

9
00:00:41,778 --> 00:00:46,454
6, times 4 which is 24. Hopefully, you're getting the hang of finding the common

10
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:47,216
denominator.
