00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Often both natural languages and programming languages

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
have optional parts that don't have to appear in every utterance.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
For example, "I think" is a totally valid sentence,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but so is "I think correctly," where we've added the adverb "correctly"

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that modified the verb "think."

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You don't need to do this, though.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You can leave it out. The sentence on the left is perfectly fine.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We're going to want to represent this optional construction,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
this optional adverb, in our formal grammar.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Here on the bottom half of the screen

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I've drawn a slightly more complicated grammar.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Sentence goes to optional adjective, subject, verb.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Subject and verb work a lot like they did before.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This time our subjects are either William or Tell,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and our verb is either shoots or bows.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But our optional adjective can either be the adjective "accurate"

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
or it can be nothing.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It disappears.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We can either leave this blank, or if you like,

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
we could write that same epsilon we used to have there

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
when we were talking about finite state machines

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
that means the empty string or no input.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Looking at this grammar, I have a quiz for you.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Fill in the blank.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Starting from sentence, how many valid utterances are there?

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
How many strings can we make in this language?

27
00:01:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
How many different things can this formal grammar produce?
