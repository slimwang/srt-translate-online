00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,270
We have reached the end of this lesson,
but

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,360
we have barely scratched
the surface of GCD.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,990
Grand Central Dispatch is a treasure
trove waiting for you to explore.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,700
There are functions to run a closure
after a delay, to run it only once,

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,680
to run a for loop in parallel and more.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,600
So read the docs and
find out how far the rabbit hole goes.
