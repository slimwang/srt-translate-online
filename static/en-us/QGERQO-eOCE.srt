Normally matrix order matters. If I rotate, then translate an object, I'll

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,340
usually get a different result than if I translate and then rotate. However,

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,732
there are exceptions. Say I give you a bunch of the same type of transforms,

4
00:00:10,732 --> 00:00:14,095
such as four different translation matrices. If I mix up the order of the

5
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:17,780
transforms, like on the second line here, would any object still be transformed

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,164
in exactly the same way by this new order, or does the ordering matter? So

7
00:00:21,164 --> 00:00:24,620
that's your first question. Can I do a series of translations in any order and

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,470
get the same result? Your second question is, what about a series of rotations?

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,070
Can I change the order and always get the same result? What about a series of

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,259
scales, uniform or non-uniform? Does order matter? Finally what about a series

11
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:40,282
of rotations and translations all along the same axis? In other words, rotate

12
00:00:40,282 --> 00:00:43,994
around z, translate around z, rotate some more around z, translate some more

13
00:00:43,994 --> 00:00:47,266
around z. And so on. Can I change the order of those matrices and get the same

14
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:50,595
result? For all these questions ignore precision errors. Assume you have

15
00:00:50,595 --> 00:00:51,423
infinite precision.
