1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,990
Okay.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,570
Here's the object I came up with.

3
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:07,330
We can see that restoring name, role and contacts, as well as,

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,250
welcome message and skills as the keys in this object.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,980
John Doe is the value for name, web developer is the value for role.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,180
Notice how there are commas after every value.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,650
Inside context, we're storing an object.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,020
We know it's an object because we see the curly braces here and here.

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,410
Inside this object, we have a few more keys and

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,759
a few more values for contact information.

11
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,210
After the object, we have a comma then we have our welcome message.

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,770
And then array for our skills.

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,130
Inside the array, noted by these square brackets, we see four skills.

14
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,980
Then we finish up with bioPic, which is a link to a URL with our image.

15
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,380
Notice that after this last value, we don't have a coma,

16
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,210
and then we finish up the object with another curly brace.
