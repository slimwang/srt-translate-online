1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is obtained by counting plus Laplacian smoothing.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We find that there are 5 movies, 3 of which are old,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but thanks to Laplacian smoothing, we add 1 up here,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and because there are 2 classes, we add 2 down here,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so we get 4/7 for the probability of old under Laplacian smoothing.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Now for the next two questions, we need to understand how big the vocabulary is.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We have 1, 2, 6 different words in the movie title vocabulary,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
so the dictionary size is 6.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
In the category of old movies, "top" occurs twice.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Without Laplacian smoothing we get 2/6

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
where the 6 originates from the 6 words in the old category.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now we add 1 on top and 6 on the bottom for the dictionary size.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We get 3/12, which is the same as 1/4.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Applying base root for the final question, the probability of old given "top"

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
given the probability of "top" given old.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It will be 1/4 times the probability of old, which is 4/7.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Now we have to normalize by the same expression over here

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
plus the expression for the new class.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The prior probability of new is 3/7,

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and the probability of the word "top" given new is obtained as follows:

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In the maximum sense you would get 1 word out of 4 in the new class to be "top,"

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
but because we apply Laplacian smoothing we add 1 to the top and 6 to the bottom,

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
which is 2/10 equals 1/5.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We plug in 1/5 over here, and then we work all these numbers together,

25
00:01:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and they happen to be 5/8, which is the final result for this question.
