1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,884
We know that for the pattern of i. It repeats after each fourth power. So for i

2
00:00:04,884 --> 00:00:09,967
to the tenth, we would go to the cycle twice. And then we would start over. We

3
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:14,930
would have i, then negative 1. I to the tenth is really the same thing as i to

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:20,680
the sixth and i squared. They all equal negative 1. We can think of this a lot

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,220
like the arithemetic on a clock. A clock cycles every 12 hours, the hour hand

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,454
passes all the numbers, and gets to 12 and then starts over. Well, that's

7
00:00:30,454 --> 00:00:35,620
similar to what's happening with i, so we'll start with i and then we'll have i

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,814
squared I-cube, either the fourth, either the fifth, either the sixth, either

9
00:00:39,814 --> 00:00:47,840
the seventh, either the eighth, either the ninth, and finally either the tenth.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,720
This is how we know either the tenth is really equal to i squared, which equals

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,250
negative 1. Our pattern repeats every four patterns of i
