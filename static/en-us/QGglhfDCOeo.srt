1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,030
We have travelled quite a bit
in our QMV diagrams here.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:10,510
We started by asking questions as to how
one should detect anomalies in data.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,170
We thought we could detect
outliers in distributions.

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,620
We inspected distributions and
looked at correlations between them.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,780
We derived certain variables.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,040
We used two variables
to form some model.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,499
The models we looked at could have
been parametric, non-parametric, or

8
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:30,600
mathematical.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,610
We concentrated on
the non-parametric models and

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,020
derive some single variable
kernel density estimates.

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:44,030
From the single variate kernel density
estimate, we look for optimal models.

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:51,040
We used mean integrated square error
to look for optimal bandwidths.

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,210
We introduced the KL divergence.

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,040
We also found some multivariate
kernel density estimators and

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,700
looked at joint probability
distribution functions.

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,890
For the multivariate methods,
we looked at outliers in the models.

17
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,070
We used Mahalanobis distance
to find the outliers and

18
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:17,820
we left it up to you to find out what
these outliers may mean in our data.

19
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,240
This completes this part of our lesson.

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,370
At this point,
we will leave behind this diagram.

21
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,680
However, you can see there
are many points we could have

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,000
further enhanced this diagram.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,440
In fact,
this is always the case with our Q and

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,510
V diagrams to find the flow of
logic in model building process.
