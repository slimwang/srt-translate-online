00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,030
Hi I'm Gabrielle, and I'm going to be
your instructor for UIKit Fundamentals.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,490
If you're taking this course, you should
have built at least one single view app

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,710
that adheres to the NBC design pattern,
which means, you know how to add objects

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,280
and storyboard and connect them in your
view controller and you're familiar with

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,550
some basic features of UIKit,
the iOS user interface library.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,670
If you're not familiar
with these concepts,

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,360
we recommend you take Intro to
iOS Development with Swift first.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,090
A link to that course is
in the instructor's notes.

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,530
This course is all about becoming
more comfortable with UIKit and

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,050
mastering its most
widely used components.

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,150
Our primary goal is to give you lots
of opportunities for hands-on coding.

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,080
And you'll build lots of small apps
to help you learn specific concepts.

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,130
At the end of the course, you'll have
the skills required to build a mean

14
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,370
generating app from the bottom up.

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,620
Let's take a detailed look at
this app in the next video.
