1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is state 6 and state 2.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Those are the 2 states in which the vacuum is on the right and that state is dirty.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The other state we can't observe, and it could have been in any state before,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so now it can be either clean or dirty.
