1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The second problem--the decision about what ciphers

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and hash functions to use--is based on these clear text messages.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
An attacker who tampers with these can make the client and server

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
use some very weak cipher and then be able to break messages encrypted without cipher.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This was really a problem because US Export Control Law is meant

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that some of these ciphers were very weak.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It was necessary to support ciphers that use only a 40-bit key to satisfy US laws.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That meant the encryption was weak enough that it could easily be broken by brute force.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The solution to this is to make sure that these messages are also authenticated.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That canât be done at the beginning because there is no key established yet,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
but that can be done at later steps.
