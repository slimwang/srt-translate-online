00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,611
The vertex of the equation y plus 3 equals the quantity x minus two squared is

2
00:00:04,611 --> 00:00:09,340
that two comma negative 3, this point down here. Even though I didn't give you

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,720
the graph, you could figure this out, by thinking about how this graph is

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,394
shifted away from the graph of y equals x squared. Here's a quick hand-drawn

5
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:23,050
version, not very spectacular I'm sorry, of y equals x squared. Our point of

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,913
reference are our parent problem. Since we already knew that the red curve would

7
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:32,442
be just an exact shift of the black curve to the right 2 and down 3. We can pick

8
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:37,148
any point on the black curve and find the corresponding point on the red curve.

9
00:00:37,148 --> 00:00:41,787
We can do this for the vertex, which is originally at 0, 0 on the black curve.

10
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:46,403
So then if we move it to the right 2, the x coordinate becomes 2. And if we move

11
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:49,146
it down 3, the y coordinate becomes negative 3.
