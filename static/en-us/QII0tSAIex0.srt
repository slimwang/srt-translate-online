00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,960
This code should be really familiar to you because it's what

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,440
we saw in lesson three. One of the first plots you

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,020
created was a histogram, so let's see what this one looks

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,100
like. We can immediately notice

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,820
some important discreetness to this distribution.

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,920
There appear to be prices at which there are many observations,

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,650
but then no observations in adjacent prices. This makes sense if

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,900
prices are set in a way that applies to many of

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,240
the consumers. There are some purchases that involve much lower prices, and

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,070
if we are interested in price sensitivity, we definitely want

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,140
to consider what sort of variations is in these prices. Now,

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,090
I also want you to note that if we chose

13
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,720
a different bin width we might obscure this discreetness. Say if

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,720
I chose a bandwidth equal to ten. In this histogram,

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,740
we would miss the observation for some of the empty spaces

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,400
for the adjacent prices. So, it's no surprise that for

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,550
this very discreet data this histogram is a very biased model.
