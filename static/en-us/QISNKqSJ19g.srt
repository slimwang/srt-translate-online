If we are going to be talking about shifting parabolas around, we should

2
00:00:03,432 --> 00:00:06,966
probably have a sort of point of reference, a standard parabola that we can

3
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:10,526
compare all the parabolas to. So I'd like you to tell me what the simplest

4
00:00:10,526 --> 00:00:14,276
equation you can think of for a parabola is. I've already filled in the y equals

5
00:00:14,276 --> 00:00:16,903
part for you, so just fill in the rest on the right side.
