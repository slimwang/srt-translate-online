For the next question, this one looks a little different. I have the absolute

2
00:00:04,675 --> 00:00:09,200
value of 2x plus 3 equals negative 5. Now, I want you to think very carefully

3
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:13,687
about this one before you start trying to solve it. You can put your answer

4
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:17,973
here. If there's no solution you can put in ns for no solution. Good luck.
