00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,190
So as a quick quiz, what allowed the Slammer worm to spread so quickly? Was

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,950
it that TCPs reliable transport ensured a

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,710
clean copy of the worm payload would spread

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,110
to different vulnerable hosts? Was it that

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,090
the worm spread by UDP, thereby enabling itself

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,940
to spread with limited network overhead? Was it

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,520
that it could infect many different types of

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,600
operating systems including Linux and Mac OS? Or, was

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,530
it that it could fit in a single packet?
