00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,680
Let me ask a question now,
if virtualization has been around since

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,150
the 60s, why do you think it hasn't
been used ubiquitously since then.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,090
Here are the possible choices.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,410
Virtualization was not efficient.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,420
Everyone used Microsoft Windows.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,720
Mainframes were not ubiquitous.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,910
Or other hardware was cheap.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,010
You should check all that apply.
