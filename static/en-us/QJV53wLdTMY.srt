1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,670
So now let's take a quick look at
the report analytics gives for goals.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,551
So we want to go to the reporting tab,
scroll down to conversions, and

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,890
choose overview.

4
00:00:14,965 --> 00:00:19,605
And again, make sure that the date
is either set to be today's date or

5
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:21,360
include today's date.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,390
The default range is do to
end at yesterday's date.

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,480
Then you can see,
click through goal screens.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,330
So I actually clicked on the show
recipe screen a couple times,

9
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,420
but it was all within one session.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,790
So I have one goal completion.

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,880
I didn't assign any
monetary value to it.

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:43,670
I didn't set up my funnel visualization,
so I don't have much here.

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,320
And I don't have any goal flow data yet.
