1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,719
All right, so, this is what I came up with.

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:07,150
First and foremost, we need to set this display method on the projects object.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,030
So, using dot notation, I simply set the property display on

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,990
the project's object and set it equal to a function.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:19,220
This function is using a for in loop, for projects in projects.projects.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,640
Inside the projects object,

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,180
we have an array of projects, also called, well, projects.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,020
Like we said in the hint,

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,020
we need to start with HTMLprojectStart to create a new project entry.

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,940
Then you'll see a set of steps where we're appending the title.

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:37,282
The dates, the description, and images to this project entry last element.

12
00:00:37,282 --> 00:00:42,220
Remember, HTMLprojectStart is creating an element with the class project entry,

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,420
and we want to grab the last one every time we work through this list.

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,120
Following the same strategies we've been using in this class,

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,210
we'll be appending each of these elements to project-entry:last, and

16
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,090
when we're done, we should see a nice beautiful project section.
