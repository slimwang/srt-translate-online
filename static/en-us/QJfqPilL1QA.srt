There may be cases where you want a
notification to only appear on a phone,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,370
and you don't want it to be synchronized
over to your wearable devices.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,570
An example might be a notification
showing that there is an upload in

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,490
progress on the phone.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,770
But it's not a notification that a user
needs to be notified on their wearable.

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,870
The NotificationCompat.Builder class
contains a method called setLocalOnly.

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,440
You can use this to insure
notifications only appear on the phone.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,640
If you want to make a notification
that only appears on a wearable and

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,490
not the phone, you'll need to
wait until the next lesson

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,119
to learn more about how to do this.
