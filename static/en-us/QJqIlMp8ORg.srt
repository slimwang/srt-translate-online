00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,300
Section two is titled research questions.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,939
A designed study examines the tradeoffs between various non-functional

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,390
requirements, for example, space and time.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,080
Each tradeoff can be expressed in the form of a question, such as,

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,750
how are execution times and

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,740
memory footprint effected as the amount of pre-processing computations vary?

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,870
The second section of your report lists such research questions.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,950
Each question should be formulated in a neutral fashion with regard to the due,

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,840
dependent variables being measured and

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,340
also indicate what factors are being varied.

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,540
That is, the independent variables.

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,430
And each question should be numbered for later reference in your report
