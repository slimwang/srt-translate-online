1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,415
For a map, we'll now add some context around the history of the World Cup,

2
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:08,670
by plotting a circle on the map for each year of the World Cup.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,910
Where its radius represents the attendance for that year.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,350
One thing to note is that I abstracted our roll up aggregation function,

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:23,350
into a function defined above as agg year, for more re-usability and clarity.

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,190
The process of overlaying circles on our map

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,540
is identical to what we did when we create a scatter plot.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,311
The only difference in this case, is that we're using our nested aggregation of

9
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:41,210
our data, and if you remember internally, our aggregation used a projection.

10
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,310
In our scatter plot,

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:47,390
we used a scale to convert from our data domain to our pixel range.

12
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,190
But since we're dealing with geographic coordinates.

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,890
We use a projection to convert from a longitude and latitude domain,

14
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:00,750
to pixel values, which we've already computed in center x and center y.

15
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,110
And just as in most of the charts we've made in D3, we first append a group,

16
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:10,170
we're going to be labeling it with class bubble.

17
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,950
We select all the circles in that group already, which in this case is empty.

18
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,370
Bind data to those circles resulting in empty place holders,

19
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,530
of which then make an enter selection corresponding to

20
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,020
all of the empty place holders with data bound to them.

21
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,720
And for each of those we append a circle on our map.
