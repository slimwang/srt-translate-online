1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,348
So now, let's calculate Tukey's HSD and see if any of the sample means for the

2
00:00:04,348 --> 00:00:09,874
amount of food cows ate is honestly significantly different. Use the

3
00:00:09,874 --> 00:00:15,510
studentized range statistic table to find the critical value of q. You'll need

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,760
to know the number of groups we're comparing, as well as the degrees of freedom

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,586
for the within group variability. You'll notice that you can calculate Tukeys

6
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:31,629
HSD for alpha equals 0.01 and 0.05. Calculate this for alpha equals 0.05.
