1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is subtle. I would actually prefer the red path.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The reason is as the robot is facing the right side over here,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
it can't take a 45-degree turn onto the green path.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It should slowly move around the corner, go down here, and slowly move to the right.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The greet path might be shorter, but it requires two 45-degree instantaeous turns,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
which are unfeasible for the robot.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
To some extent, we'd like to find a smooth path that is executable by the robot.
