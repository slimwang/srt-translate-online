1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,910
Well, a recipe is not an entity but
that's close.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,880
An entity would be
an individual incident.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,420
Something like a chocolate cake
recipe or a rhubarb pie recipe.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,940
Those entities are examples or
incidences of a recipe.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,100
But recipe itself isn't an entity.

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,040
Just as the ent type
isn't itself an integer.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,980
So yeah that means that recipes
match the definition of a kind.

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,710
It answers the questions
of what kinds of objects or

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,090
entities are we going to make here.

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,240
And how do we represent kinds in code?

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,480
Well, kinds are just theoretical
concepts from the app engine data store

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,470
but classes are the blueprints that we
use in our code to make instances from.

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,670
So class is also a correct answer.

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,790
Finally we just talked about properties
above in our name, ingredients,

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,340
instructions, and so forth.

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,360
Those are properties so
recipe is not a property.
