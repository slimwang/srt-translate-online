1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,490
Yeah, so
one thing that'll be really helpful for

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:08,140
this project is using the developer
tools provided to you by Chrome.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,360
In our particular,
the JavaScript console be really,

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,980
really useful in giving
you information on

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,660
what still isn't being defined or
what you still need to call.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,020
And make sure you make use
of the console.log function.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,120
So I've loaded things on my local host,
I've, there you go,

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,520
see I have two errors already.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,460
I enter these as not defined and
then you know player is not defined.

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,820
So basically I have this error here.

11
00:00:37,858 --> 00:00:41,050
I'm like okay, well where,
how do i go and look into this error?

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,510
Well, Google Tools has some
awesome tool sets for you and

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,680
you can just like really expand
the error, it's going to tell you.

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,240
>> Exactly.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,230
>> In your stack.

16
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,760
So basically I am going in.

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,890
>> First thing is, on the right side,
it tells you the finding.

18
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:00,960
>> The founding or the line numbers?

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,530
>> Line number.
>> Line numbers, yes, exactly.

20
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,480
>> And essentially you can go to that
line number, go to the first error.

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,690
Also the files come with lots of
comments that explain what you

22
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,520
need to do.

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,100
>> Yeah.

24
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,490
>> What your code should look like.

25
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,080
>> Exactly.

26
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,870
>> And that's a good start,
give it a try.

27
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:27,070
I really recommend, I mean personally,
I don't like to go look for

28
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,210
an answer before I try it.

29
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,410
>> Yeah, try it.

30
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,259
Just be like a detective or
be there's a picture, like you could

31
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:39,821
be a detective or could be a dare devil,
like you're the coding dare devil,

32
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:42,910
you just dive straight in,
try to break things up.

33
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,690
>> Be at three year old
>> Exactly.

34
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,840
>> Yes tha's what they do.

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,790
>> Yeah, when you have a three year old.

36
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,338
Right?

37
00:01:47,338 --> 00:01:48,130
Six.

38
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,470
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> So I mean,

39
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,520
yeah, be that daring person and try to
explore and purposely break things.

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,370
So I'm exploring,
I'm breaking things right now.

41
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,870
>> Absolutely.
>> I'm going to click on engine.js on

42
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,790
line number 94.

43
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:09,610
So the engine will say okay, I'm going
to do function of the entities and

44
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,602
says are enemies for each enemy.

45
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:12,476
> Exactly
>> And

46
00:02:12,476 --> 00:02:16,898
then it says on [CROSSTALK] references
allEnemies is not defined.

47
00:02:16,898 --> 00:02:18,798
I'm not define my allEnemies.

48
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:20,418
>> Go ahead define allEnemies.

49
00:02:20,418 --> 00:02:23,278
>> Let's just go define allEnemies and
then go through the code.

50
00:02:23,278 --> 00:02:27,496
If you look through
the code a little more you

51
00:02:27,496 --> 00:02:31,718
will find that all
enemies will be in app.js.

52
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:36,138
Here, now there it goes, see here's
instructions now instantiate your

53
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:39,858
objects place allEnemy objects
in an array called allEnemies.

54
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:40,720
>> There you go.

55
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,720
>> Now why don't i just
to create something

56
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,560
in my code that says for
all enemies equals that.

57
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,910
>> See what happens.

58
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,440
>> See what happens.

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,960
Can I save this?

60
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,770
No I don't think I can save this.

61
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,390
If you run suggest you'll
get some more errors.

62
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,770
And then you need to find out okay,
what's next step.

63
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,690
>> What's the next step?

64
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,090
>> What's the next step, error.

65
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,150
I need to I'll give you a hint.

66
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,980
I actually have nothing in all enemies
because I was supposed to have some

67
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,510
sort of like new enemy I think.

68
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,020
New enemy, maybe new enemy,
now I instantiate it.

69
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,810
I actually near genius, of course,
I create a new object by putting new.

70
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,690
So okay, save that and
see what else writes.

71
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,620
Now handle these errors
one step at a time, and

72
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,600
just think of errors as bread crumbs,
they are clues to what you need to do.

73
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,100
>> Absolutely.
