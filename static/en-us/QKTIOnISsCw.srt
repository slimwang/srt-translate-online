1
00:00:00,271 --> 00:00:03,097
Alright everybody, this is going to be Office Hours

2
00:00:03,097 --> 00:00:06,273
for Unit 1. Thank you all for participating so far in

3
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:09,213
taking the class. I hope itÃ¢ÂÂs been informative for

4
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:11,513
you so far, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to Ã¢ÂÂ that was the easy

5
00:00:11,513 --> 00:00:12,913
stuff. So after this you know weÃ¢ÂÂre going to get

6
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:15,345
into some of the tricky things. So JohnÃ¢ÂÂs found

7
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:17,915
some questions from the forums that weÃ¢ÂÂre going

8
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:22,360
to go through that you guys have all had. So, letÃ¢ÂÂs

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,220
go.

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,407
Okay, well the first question is about Google App

11
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:29,639
Engine and people had a lot of questions about

12
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:31,907
Google App Engine. How it works? How to get it

13
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,507
running? Problems they had. Whether we were

14
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:36,306
going to need to use it? So just if we could go

15
00:00:36,306 --> 00:00:37,957
over all of that stuff real quick.

16
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:42,233
Okay, so to answer your question first or to take it

17
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:44,563
from the top basically. We chose Google App

18
00:00:44,563 --> 00:00:46,452
Engine because we thought it would be the

19
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:48,288
Engine because we thought it would be the

20
00:00:48,288 --> 00:00:52,314
website online. Believe it or not, even after

21
00:00:52,314 --> 00:00:54,347
reading the forums I still believe itÃ¢ÂÂs the easiest

22
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:57,513
way to get something online. That said, if you

23
00:00:57,513 --> 00:01:00,131
donÃ¢ÂÂt want to use it, you donÃ¢ÂÂt have to. All of the

24
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:02,483
homeworks are going to be structured with the

25
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:04,361
same basic format which is submit a URL that

26
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:07,681
does Ã¢ÂÂXÃ¢ÂÂ. So if you can get a URL online that does

27
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:10,014
Ã¢ÂÂXÃ¢ÂÂ, great. So if you want to run this off your local

28
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:12,192
machine, use Apache, whatever, youÃ¢ÂÂre allowed

29
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,935
to do that. But I am going to be teaching all the

30
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:17,238
lessons using Google App Engine, that will be

31
00:01:17,238 --> 00:01:19,553
what IÃ¢ÂÂll Ã¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs what IÃ¢ÂÂll be demoing in the class,

32
00:01:19,553 --> 00:01:21,107
thatÃ¢ÂÂs what IÃ¢ÂÂll be working from and thatÃ¢ÂÂs

33
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:23,607
generally what IÃ¢ÂÂll be talking about.

34
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:25,736
So the way Google App Engine works, the idea is

35
00:01:25,736 --> 00:01:28,654
youÃ¢ÂÂre just writing these Python files, and youÃ¢ÂÂve

36
00:01:28,654 --> 00:01:32,154
got two options of running and distributing your

37
00:01:32,154 --> 00:01:35,210
code. You can either use the launcher program,

38
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,871
which itÃ¢ÂÂs got a little play button that will allow you

39
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:40,369
to start up your app once you add it to the

40
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:43,716
launcher. And that requires, Google App Engine

41
00:01:43,716 --> 00:01:46,064
itself doesnÃ¢ÂÂt ship with Python. You need to have

42
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,575
Python installed on your machine and that seems

43
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:50,654
to be where a lot of the trouble is. Google App

44
00:01:50,654 --> 00:01:52,307
Engine Ã¢ÂÂ thereÃ¢ÂÂs two versions of it. One will work

45
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:54,022
with Python 2.7 and one will work with Python

46
00:01:54,022 --> 00:01:57,676
2.5. Nothing in this course requires 2.5 or 2.7

47
00:01:57,676 --> 00:02:01,657
specifically. So just get one of them working and

48
00:02:01,657 --> 00:02:02,487
go from there.

49
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:07,443
Now once youÃ¢ÂÂve got your app running locally,

50
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:09,774
then you can either use the launcher to upload

51
00:02:09,774 --> 00:02:11,860
the app or you can use the console utility.

52
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,498
Personally I use the console utility, you just say, I

53
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:17,747
think app config update and you point it at the

54
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:20,396
directory where your files are and then it churns

55
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:22,999
for a little while and then you can go to your

56
00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:27,224
accountname.appspot.com and see your app. So

57
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:30,024
if you have any specific troubles, post them in the

58
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,274
forum. Other students have been really helpful

59
00:02:32,274 --> 00:02:35,572
with specific sysadmining answers and that sort

60
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,965
of thing. So keep asking, keep working at it. This

61
00:02:38,965 --> 00:02:41,483
first homework is basically just get this thing

62
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:43,535
online and I know that can be a pain on some of

63
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:45,221
your machines. So letÃ¢ÂÂs just get this thing online

64
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:47,926
so we can move onward with the course. And if

65
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:50,600
you want to use something else, knock yourself

66
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,871
out, weÃ¢ÂÂre not going to be able to help you but

67
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:55,645
youÃ¢ÂÂre free to learn and try it on your own.

68
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:58,593
Okay. The next question is from Brian Y and he

69
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:00,872
wants to know, what are some useful things to

70
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:02,918
.know about frontend web app development?

71
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:06,219
Okay, cool. So, good question, because weÃ¢ÂÂre not

72
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:06,996
going to be spending a whole lot of time on

73
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:10,183
frontend web app development in this class. The

74
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:12,242
main pieces of technology you want to know

75
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:14,743
would be JavaScript and CSS. JavaScript is a

76
00:03:14,743 --> 00:03:17,461
separate programming language that runs in the

77
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:19,995
browser and you serve JavaScript just like you

78
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:22,475
would serve HTML and you can manipulate your

79
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:25,707
HTML, you can manipulate CSS and that sort of

80
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:28,216
stuff. Google for a JavaScript tutorial and you will

81
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:33,779
have plenty of resources to learn from. And CSS,

82
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:37,035
thatÃ¢ÂÂs basically another type of file you would

83
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:39,018
serve from your web server and that controls the

84
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:42,219
styling, the colors, the font sizes, the layout of

85
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:46,476
your HTML. IÃ¢ÂÂll use CSS in this class and IÃ¢ÂÂll

86
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,951
provide you when we start getting into some of

87
00:03:48,951 --> 00:03:51,432
the more complex websites youÃ¢ÂÂre going to be

88
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,718
building like when we start doing the blog stuff, IÃ¢ÂÂll

89
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:55,770
point to where my CSS is so you can download

90
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,016
that and use it if you want. But for the most part,

91
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:01,552
you know, the way weÃ¢ÂÂre doing the grading on all

92
00:04:01,552 --> 00:04:03,327
of these homeworks is weÃ¢ÂÂre going to have our

93
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:06,575
own piece of software thatÃ¢ÂÂs basically

94
00:04:06,575 --> 00:04:08,940
manipulating your website and itÃ¢ÂÂs really hard for

95
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,407
us to see if your website even looks right, so the

96
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:12,942
appearance of things is not something we can

97
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:15,674
really grade anyway, but if you have some

98
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:17,596
professional pride and want to make things look

99
00:04:17,596 --> 00:04:19,534
nice, JavaScript and CSS are the technologies

100
00:04:19,534 --> 00:04:21,699
you want to learn and you can use those on your

101
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,115
own if you want to learn in this class, itÃ¢ÂÂs not

102
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:24,542
going to affect how we grade homeworks or

103
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:27,220
anything like that. So, good question.

104
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,535
Okay. Brian Y has a number of additional questions.

105
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:31,919
Okay.

106
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,795
And one of them is, is Google App Engine a good

107
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:39,247
solution for large scale projects and are there any

108
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:42,823
unforeseen difficulties? What costs involved with that?

109
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:46,052
Sure, well there are costs, there are literal costs.

110
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,935
Google App Engine is free at a small scale, so it

111
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:50,602
will work for all of our homeworks but if you want

112
00:04:50,602 --> 00:04:53,001
to run it at a larger scale youÃ¢ÂÂve got to pay for the

113
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,652
bandwidth you use and how much data you store

114
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:58,730
and that sort of things. I personally havenÃ¢ÂÂt used

115
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:03,239
App Engine in production, but udacity.com itself

116
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:06,960
runs on Udacity. So many people do use it in

117
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,758
production. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a great way to get started and the

118
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:11,665
things IÃ¢ÂÂll be focusing on this class you can take

119
00:05:11,665 --> 00:05:14,184
with you outside of App Engine. I am basically

120
00:05:14,184 --> 00:05:16,117
going to be talking about high level concepts.

121
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:18,254
ThereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of things that App Engine provides

122
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:20,192
that weÃ¢ÂÂll actually be building ourselves. So when

123
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:24,376
we start doing user registration and cookies and

124
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:26,142
that sort of stuff, weÃ¢ÂÂre just going to take that from

125
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:27,796
the top anyway because I want you to understand

126
00:05:27,796 --> 00:05:30,212
the technologies and it won't be specific to App

127
00:05:30,212 --> 00:05:33,308
Engine or what other framework youÃ¢ÂÂd like to use.

128
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:35,477
So the short answer is, yes you can use it for

129
00:05:35,477 --> 00:05:37,957
large scale projects. I personally donÃ¢ÂÂt have a lot

130
00:05:37,957 --> 00:05:40,573
of experience doing that, so if youÃ¢ÂÂve got more

131
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,490
specific questions, hit up the forums.

132
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,858
Great. Another question that Brian Y had was

133
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:49,208
what kind of challenges you ran into when .

134
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,649
developing Reddit and Hipmunk?.

135
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:54,315
Okay, so thatÃ¢ÂÂs actually basically what this whole

136
00:05:54,315 --> 00:05:57,275
course is about. So I am not going to answer that

137
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:59,878
specifically here. I could perhaps do a seven-

138
00:05:59,878 --> 00:06:03,338
lecture series about things I learned doing Reddit

139
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:06,993
and Hipmunk. But specifically Unit 7 is going to

140
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:09,690
be about those types of problems. Unit 7 is how

141
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,105
to build websites in the real world and some of

142
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,476
the other things youÃ¢ÂÂll have to think about. How to

143
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,768
deal with like large numbers of users, customer

144
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:22,176
service and all those kind of little things that we

145
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:24,236
had to think about getting Reddit off the ground or

146
00:06:24,236 --> 00:06:25,822
getting Hipmunk off the ground. Well IÃ¢ÂÂll spend a

147
00:06:25,822 --> 00:06:28,063
whole lot of time talking about that unit, in Unit 7,

148
00:06:28,063 --> 00:06:32,280
so if you hang with me until then, youÃ¢ÂÂll get your answer.

149
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,179
Okay. The next question is from I-n-sa and she

150
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:38,671
wants to know how weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be graded. In

151
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:42,311
101 quizzes werenÃ¢ÂÂt graded, homework was and

152
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:45,977
the final counted for half, I believe, and she was

153
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:49,891
wondering what exactly is going to be the structure of this?

154
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:52,867
Okay, sure. So in this class there isnÃ¢ÂÂt going to be

155
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:55,000
a final. There are going to be homeworks at the

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,167
end of each unit that basically involve you getting

157
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,950
your website online that does things. So the

158
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,717
homeworks are the most important thing. If you

159
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:04,155
can pass those homeworks you know how to

160
00:07:04,155 --> 00:07:06,642
build basic websites and thatÃ¢ÂÂs the goal of this

161
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:08,159
class. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what I want you to leave this class

162
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:12,218
being able to do. So the in-lecture quizzes, those

163
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:13,709
donÃ¢ÂÂt count towards your grade. Those are

164
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:15,861
basically to keep you engaged, to keep you

165
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:17,476
paying attention and to sometimes introduce

166
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:20,209
some new concepts, but those arenÃ¢ÂÂt required;

167
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:22,779
the homeworks are. So itÃ¢ÂÂs important that you

168
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:26,183
figure those out and get those online. Now you

169
00:07:26,183 --> 00:07:28,032
donÃ¢ÂÂt actually have to have those homeworks

170
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:32,506
working each week. ItÃ¢ÂÂs my understanding that we

171
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:35,701
can test those any time. So at the homework due

172
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:37,960
date after which weÃ¢ÂÂll post the solutions, but the

173
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,128
solutions arenÃ¢ÂÂt going to be Ã¢ÂÂ when building

174
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,030
websites a lot of the challenge isnÃ¢ÂÂt knowing what

175
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,452
code to write, itÃ¢ÂÂs how to get this thing online, how

176
00:07:46,452 --> 00:07:48,151
to get the pieces to fit together. So youÃ¢ÂÂre still

177
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:50,262
going to have to figure that out and get these

178
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,807
things online and thatÃ¢ÂÂs where your grade is going to come

179
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,071
from.

180
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:54,375
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs it for Office Hours. I want to thank

181
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,167
everybody whoÃ¢ÂÂs been hanging out in the forums

182
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,226
answering questions, itÃ¢ÂÂs been really, really

183
00:07:58,226 --> 00:08:00,429
helpful. I know this stuff can be frustrating getting

184
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:03,327
things working. Sean here will be in the forums to

185
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,380
help. HeÃ¢ÂÂs kind of my guy on the ground making

186
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,876
sure everything is going smoothly. So if youÃ¢ÂÂre

187
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:12,075
stuck hang out in the forums. IÃ¢ÂÂll be in IRC as well

188
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,218
if you want to chat with me during the day and

189
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:16,554
good luck with the rest of the course.

190
00:08:16,554 --> 00:08:19,028
Real quick, what is the IRC channel because

191
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:20,977
some of our students might not know that?

192
00:08:20,977 --> 00:08:23,229
Yes, okay. ItÃ¢ÂÂs on freenode, and I believe it is

193
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:27,154
##udacity-cs253 and there should be some

194
00:08:27,154 --> 00:08:30,053
information about how to get in there on the

195
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:31,970
forums.

196
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,931
Okay, great.

197
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:36,000
Alright, guys. Good luck.
