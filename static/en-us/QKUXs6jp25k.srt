1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,730
And the answer is no, the load doesn't act as

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,470
the cache or the memory. We know that this is

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,860
the same address, so the load will get it's value

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,970
from the store. So the correct answer here is no.
