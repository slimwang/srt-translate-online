1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,190
Okay, so a final checklist.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,905
>> Yes.
>> All right, tests are all passing.

3
00:00:03,905 --> 00:00:05,120
>> Mm-hm.

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,880
>> And the error cases?

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,960
>> Done.

6
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,740
>> The new onboarding flow?

7
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,464
>> Beautiful.
>> Yes, and

8
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:13,160
those material design guidelines?

9
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:13,960
>> Completed.

10
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,540
>> And then perf?

11
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,510
>> Well, performance looks
great on my new phone, but

12
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,770
this older phone
performance is a little.

13
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,190
>> Don't say that word again.

14
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,950
>> What performance?

15
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,450
>> Behold, it is I,
quote Master of Fame, wait a minute.

16
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,360
I've been here before.

17
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,320
>> And now your back.

18
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,320
>> What's he doing here?

19
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,270
>> If you say performance three times,
he'll just magically appear.

20
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,540
>> Ian, Joanna,
what are we doing here at Udacity.

21
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,180
I thought we already had
a course on performance.

22
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,770
>> So we do, and
that's why we actually don't need you.

23
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,480
It was an accident.

24
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,840
The words just kind of
fell out of his mouth.

25
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,740
And we definitely don't need
to you to go through any Apps.

26
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,530
We don't have any-
>> Whoa.

27
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,880
Wait.
What are you talking about?

28
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,800
Do you have a bad performing
application that you need help with?

29
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,755
I knew there was something wrong here.

30
00:00:57,755 --> 00:00:59,615
[LAUGH]
>> Well Cole,

31
00:00:59,615 --> 00:01:03,960
I don't know if you noticed
the performance stuff, but.

32
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,220
Maybe you can help?

33
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,820
>> No, no, no, no, sorry, no thank you.

34
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,020
We don't need your help.

35
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,580
The thing is if we actually
know what we're doing, and

36
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,920
we don't need him to kind of jump in and

37
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,940
help us because we can go
through this ourselves.

38
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,110
>> Joanna, Joanna, nonsense.

39
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,190
I'm here to help.

40
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,410
Why don't we go ahead and
take a look at things.

41
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,680
Open up your application on your phone
and why don't you start by telling me

42
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,280
what you've been seeing in some of the
profiling tools that you've been running

43
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,360
your app in.

44
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,720
>> Well,
we actually haven't run any tools yet.

45
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,900
Performance has been great.

46
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,300
>> Wait, are you joking?

47
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,230
Is he joking?

48
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,780
Seriously?

49
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,800
Are you people punking me?

50
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,610
Are you recording this for
a gag real or something?

51
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,890
What's going on here?

52
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,610
>> Can you just give me a minute?

53
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,940
We haven't tried any tools yet because
we haven't started working on Perf yet.

54
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,670
>> Madam, you insult me.

55
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,350
Performance isn't something
you just idly cast about and

56
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,030
handle at the end of your application.

57
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,000
When you submit your
app to the play store.

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,810
Users give negative feedback on it,
three times

59
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,600
more active than any other thing in your
application that they actually hate.

60
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,330
That alone means that performance
isn't something that you cast

61
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,130
off until the end.

62
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,880
You bring it up to the front,
you should be doing it the whole way.

63
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,750
>> Okay, take a breath.

64
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,190
Are you breathing?

65
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,170
Don't you to fall.

66
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,900
That would be a terrible shame.

67
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,110
So what we're actually
trying to get at here,

68
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,200
is that we have all of these difference
perf tools that are available to help us

69
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
see a bunch of different problems.

70
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,550
And kind of walk us through
where maybe there's some issues.

71
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,550
>> Right, there's like trace.

72
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,520
>> Exactly, just like trace.

73
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,400
>> Yeah, and we actually have a whole
federation of applications you can

74
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,280
also run on your application-
>> Okay.

75
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,690
Okay.
Thank you for jumping in.

76
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,820
Your knowledge is valuable.

77
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,780
I was talking.

78
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,000
What we're trying to say here is
there's more than just trace view.

79
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,620
It doesn't end there.

80
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,930
We actually have a different tool for
a bunch of different situations.

81
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,056
Maybe you want to look at
your rendering perf, right?

82
00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:41,725
>> [COUGH] Overdraw tool.

83
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:42,490
>> Mm-hm.

84
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,748
Or maybe you want to see how
your memory's being used.

85
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:45,809
>> [COUGH] Memory allocator.

86
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,550
>> The point is that you
have a different tool for

87
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,460
different situations and you can
actually use several tools together to

88
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,180
narrow down where the real
problems are happening so

89
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,940
you can focus your efforts on fixing the
real problem as opposed to maybe hiding.

90
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,060
>> Which, by the way,

91
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,940
we talk about in great deal in our
Android Performance Course here at

92
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,300
Udacity you can click on
in the instructor notes.

93
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,520
>> I know, I know.

94
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,160
You made a course.

95
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,720
We all know.

96
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,368
We got the tweet.

97
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:13,840
>> Yeah, I saw the tweet.

98
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,480
So, Cole, we really should be testing
the performance before we ship.

99
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,770
>> Oh, yeah, absolutely.

100
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,230
Some of the best engineers I've ever
worked with in my career have all been

101
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,660
performance minded.

102
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,380
In fact, some of the greatest companies
we have out there will actually create

103
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,760
unit tests entirely
focused on performance.

104
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,630
So that they can actually find any
performance regressions that occur

105
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,050
to the line of code that's
checked into their source tree.

106
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,980
There's some really exciting stuff
going on right now out there.

107
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,980
>> It's so exciting,

108
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,880
just like your mad scientist
lunch that you have every month.

109
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,810
>> Hey, hey,
that's a little below the belt.

110
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,740
What is your problem.

111
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,710
I am here to help.

112
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,630
You guys summoned me here to
solve your problem that you have

113
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,910
in performance on your application.

114
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,810
>> I'm going to step out and
get some water.

115
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,390
You guys chat.

116
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,600
>> And all you've done is
give me grief about this.

117
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
What's going on?
>> Because I didn't summon you.

118
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,640
You jumped in because you heard there
were performance and you care a lot,

119
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,830
except maybe some people want to do
their own perf work and don't want you

120
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,086
doing it for them, because believe it or
not, I know about Android performance.

121
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:05,270
And I'm good at Android performance, and

122
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,570
I'm good enough to teach other
people about it, so let me.

123
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,510
>> Okay, so you think you
know what you're doing, huh?

124
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,790
>> I do, I do,
>> Prove it.

125
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,290
>> I will.

126
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,610
I'm being summoned.

127
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,341
This isn't over.

128
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:21,226
[SOUND]
[SOUND]

129
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:22,384
>> Okay, so now that he's gone,

130
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:24,168
I'll actually walk you
through the tools, and

131
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:26,857
you can see what we're talking about
without him interrupting again.
