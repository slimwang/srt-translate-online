00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,860
An ideal solution would be semantic, and it would

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,900
validate properly. It wouldn't require Java Script or a

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,960
server configuration, necessarily. It would only load one copy

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,370
of the image, and it would work across all

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,920
browsers, and be accessible. Unfortunately, that solution doesn't exist

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,020
today. There's several solutions under discussion. Right now, it

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,980
looks like the end solution will be some version

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,630
of the picture element. Hopefully, this will be hashed

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,760
out in the relatively near future, so stay tuned to

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,220
the standards community for more. There's a link to the

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,970
Responsive Images Community Group in the Instructor Notes. In the

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,750
meantime, though, let's take a look at some other solutions.
