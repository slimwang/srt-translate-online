1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Which of these yields the "group" behavior

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
we were expecting from the radio buttons?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Do we give them all the same "id" attribute,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the same "name" attribute,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the same "group" attribute--

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
or do we include all the s in a element?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You can go ahead and try this out on your own

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and see what you find.
