00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,578
Now that we've covered monomials, let's make this a bit more challenging. Let's

2
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:08,734
multiply two binomials. I'm going to start with numbers to give a sense of the

3
00:00:08,734 --> 00:00:13,140
model. Now, even I can't do this that quickly in my head. I actually go about

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,522
this another way. I split up 12 into 10 plus 2. And 14 into 10 plus 4. When I do

5
00:00:17,522 --> 00:00:22,309
2 digit multiplication in my head, I'm actually thinking about a rectangle. The

6
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:28,134
first factor, or side of my rectangle is 10 and 2. The second factor, or side of

7
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:34,026
my rectangle, is 10 plus 4. Now this is pretty easy to visualize and think about

8
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:40,924
multiplying the numbers together. I would have 100, 40, 20 and 8. To get each of

9
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:46,548
these areas, I'm simply multiplying the sides of the rectangles. This one is 10,

10
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:51,710
and this one is 10, so 100. This rectangle is 2, and this side is 10 because

11
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,911
this side is 10, so 20. Here, this opposite side is also 10, so I have 10 times

12
00:00:56,911 --> 00:01:03,531
4, which is 40. And finally, this bottom rectangle is 2 by 4. So I get a total

13
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:09,966
of 8. Adding up all of these areas, I get 168. Try multiplying this out and

14
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:16,763
you'll find it's 168. Pretty amazing. This also makes sense because I have 10

15
00:01:16,763 --> 00:01:22,281
times 10, which is 100. These 1s are really in the tens spot. Then I have 2

16
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:27,213
times 10 which is 20. Again, this 1 is in the tens spot. 4 times 10, which is

17
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:31,956
40, and 2 times 4, which is 8. These are for the ones spot. I hope this is a new

18
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:35,278
way to think about multiplication for some of you.
