00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,545
In problem number one, 3x equals 12. x is not by itself yet because it's being

2
00:00:04,557 --> 00:00:09,210
multiplied by 3. The thing that undoes multiplication is division. So you need

3
00:00:09,222 --> 00:00:13,615
to divide by the number we're presently multiplying. So, I'm going to say we

4
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:18,055
need to divide this entire side by 3. Now, whatever we do over here, we also

5
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:22,975
need to do on the right side. Divide 12 by 3 as well. We know that 3x over 3

6
00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:28,288
gives us just x, which is why we wanted to divide by 3 in the first place. So

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,701
now, we need to carry it out on the right hand side. 12 over 3 is 4. So we get x

8
00:00:33,713 --> 00:00:39,071
equals 4. Checking our answer, we have 3 times 4 equals 12, and 3 times 4 does

9
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:44,431
in fact equal 12. So we're in good shape. And number two, x is being divided by

10
00:00:44,443 --> 00:00:49,493
3. In the last problem we undid multiplication with division. So here, we can

11
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:54,752
undo division with multiplication. To undo division by 3, we need to multiply by

12
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:59,930
that same number 3. You do this to both sides and 12 times 3 is 36. Checking, 36

13
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:02,382
over 3 is in fact equal to 12. Awesome.

14
00:01:02,387 --> 00:01:07,025
Another one done. Last but not least, x minus 3 equals 12. This problem is

15
00:01:07,037 --> 00:01:11,790
telling us that we're looking for a number so that if we took 3 away from that

16
00:01:11,802 --> 00:01:16,510
number, we would get 12. That means that number is 3 greater than 12 then. So,

17
00:01:16,522 --> 00:01:22,323
to undo this subtraction on the left hand side, we need to add 3. And over here,

18
00:01:22,335 --> 00:00:00,000
we get x equals 15. We will also confirm that 15 minus 3 equals 12. Great.
