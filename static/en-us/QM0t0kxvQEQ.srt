1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So by this point, we've totally conquered Ambiguity, right?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Ah--not so right.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Even if I know whether an operation

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
is Left or Right Associative,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm still not sure, when there are multiple operations, which one to do first.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I could do the Multiplication first,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and get: 8 + 6 is 14

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
or I could do the Addition first,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and get: 2 * 10 is 20.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This isn't the same problem as associativity

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
because it's not about whether we're associating to the Left or the Right,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
it's about the--sort of the precedence of these Operators.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
which one is more important,

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which one should I deal with first--

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
which one binds more tightly.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In Standard mathematics, we'd want to do the multiplication first.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Multiplication has higher precedence than Addition.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It gets serviced first.
