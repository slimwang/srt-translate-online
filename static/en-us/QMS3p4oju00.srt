00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The next kind of software testing that I want to talk about is integration testing.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Integration testing refers to taking multiple software modules

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
that have already been unit tested and testing them in combination with each other.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
At this point often what we're really testing

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
are the interfaces between modules,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and the question is did we define them tightly enough

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and specify them tightly enough that the different people

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
or the different groups of people implementing the different modules

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
were able to make compatible assumptions,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which are necessary for the software modules to all actually work together.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And it often turns out that during integration testing

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
we find substantial differences of assumption

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that have to be resolved before we can create a reliable

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
integration of the individual parts.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And so as a computer science professor, what I find

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
is that groups of students are almost always successful

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
at creating well-tested, reliable software modules,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
but that separate groups of students who individually

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
create software modules, even when implementing to a fairly tight specification,

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
often create software modules that fail under integration testing.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's really something that's quite a lot harder to do.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Coming up with a software module that survives integration testing

23
00:01:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is really quite a lot harder often than creating reliable small units.
