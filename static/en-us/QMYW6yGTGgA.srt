1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,310
In summary, an operating system is a layer of

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,528
systems software that resides between applications and hardware.

3
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:10,370
It corresponds to the software that has privileges to

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,250
access the underlying hardware and manipulates its state.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,570
In contrast, software that corresponds to the applications is

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,290
not allowed to do that.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,600
Its role is to hide hardware complexity and

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,510
to manage the hardware on behalf of one or more applications.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,390
And it has to do that according to some predefined policies.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,900
And finally, it has to ensure that applications are isolated and

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,030
protected from one another.
