1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,420
All right, now we're going to take
everything you've learned and

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,860
make a simple birthday card app.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,850
The apps going to look like this.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,490
It's a digital card that you can
show and share with a friend or

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,150
family member.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,160
Then at the end of the practice set,

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,960
you'll be making your
own custom holiday card.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,900
So what I'm going to do for
you right now,

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,400
is breakdown the process of turning
a drawing like this into code.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,520
And this is going to
take three easy steps.

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,540
And when you're designing
application layouts,

12
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,580
these are good steps to follow if
you're not sure how to get started.

13
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,640
Okay, so step one is to take the layout
and select the correct views to use.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,530
Step two is to then take those views and
position them on the screen.

15
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,960
And basically, you do step two by
choosing the correct view group and

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,290
then selecting the correct
positioning attributes.

17
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,615
Finally, we add all of the stylistic
touches in step three.

18
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:50,365
This is where we take the views and
add things like color or

19
00:00:50,365 --> 00:00:51,965
font related attributes.

20
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:55,066
One thing you'll notice is that this
card says Happy Birthday Ben, and

21
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:55,588
From Lyla.

22
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:59,246
Now your name probably isn't Lyla and
maybe you don't have a friend named Ben,

23
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:03,320
so you can feel free to change this text
around as we go through the example.

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,640
All right, so
we're going to go ahead and

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,340
jump right in, let's start with step
one, which is selecting the views.

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,450
Given this application,
what views do you think are included?
