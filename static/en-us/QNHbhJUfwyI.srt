00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,006
Now, that we've solved this equation one way. Let's try and solve it using

2
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:08,077
logs. Now, using a log as an operator is a little bit different from the way

3
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:12,572
other operators work. We still have to do the same thing to both sides of the

4
00:00:12,572 --> 00:00:17,004
equation, but we're not multiplying by log. What we're doing is we're using

5
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:21,420
each side of the equation as the input to the log function. And because it is a

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,500
function, when the inputs are the same, their outputs will be the same as well.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,465
Now, since on the left side here, we have the function 10 to the x and we want

8
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:37,210
to get x by itself. We want to find the inverse of f of x equals 10 to the x.

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,920
So what base log do you think we'll need to use?
