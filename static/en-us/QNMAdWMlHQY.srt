1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,210
So I do want to mention before
we move on to something else

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,790
that privacy I've said in
a individual's ability to control.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,140
But it doesn't just have
to apply to individuals.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,810
There may be reasons for
universities, hospitals,

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:22,760
charities, or even political action
committees sometimes don't need to

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,990
tell the rest of us who's contributing
to their cause and whatever.

7
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,310
So when you talk about privacy you
focus a lot on the individual and

8
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:36,850
their ability but it also applies to
organizations and some of those examples

9
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,850
we have here either because they want
to protect date about people who

10
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,770
are affiliated with those
organizations as their employees or

11
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,930
are their employees and
things like that.

12
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,050
So, although privacy we largely
talked about individual,

13
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,740
but we should keep in mind that
it also applies to organizations.
