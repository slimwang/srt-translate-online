1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,710
So let's see what happens if we substitute zero for near

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,990
in the equation. Here's the substitution. Let's simplify. This element goes to

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,800
negative one and this element goes to zero. If you look at

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,970
this matrix and examine its effect on the various coordinates, you'll notice

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,300
he following: first, the last collumn was all zeros, so the

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,230
W value of the coordinate will have no effect on the result.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,160
This leaves only the incoming Z value of the coordinate affecting the

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,480
output Z and W value. Whatever the Z value is coming in,

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,180
the resulting Z and W will be that original

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,630
Z value multiplied by negative 1. In other words,

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,790
the output Z and W values will always be

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,700
identical. When you divide by W, the result will always

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,595
be 1, except for the case where W is

14
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:39,780
0. The distance of an object from the camera

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,010
will almost always be 1, which is not a

16
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,209
useful result if you're trying to use the Z buffer.
