1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,100
The apps and games that are at
the top of the grossing charts,

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,263
on any of the different
platforms stores are generally

3
00:00:08,263 --> 00:00:11,020
using IAP's in order
to drive that revenue.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,880
It's where the bulk of it's coming from.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,150
And there's a couple of key things
that they keep in mind when the app

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:23,380
developers are determining which IAP's
they should offer and how to price them.

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,840
First and foremost, when choosing which
items to offer as in-app purchases,

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,550
you have to make sure that the items
are content that enriches the game.

9
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,930
I wouldn't rely on just having something
that prevents ads from being shown

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,310
or maybe just one or two variations
in graphics or things like that.

11
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,195
It has to really be something
that stands out and

12
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:51,060
takes somebody that may have never paid
and turns them into a paying user.

13
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,490
There are a few
different forms of IAP's.

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:59,189
This first are content, so
if you want to offer new items,

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,030
perhaps new maps, if it's a game,
that falls under content.

16
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,700
The second is functionality, so

17
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,330
if there's a different way to use your
app or game, perhaps a different mode.

18
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,030
Perhaps you want to unlock
different weapons that might

19
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,060
dramatically change
the game play experience.

20
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,310
That would fall under functionality.

21
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,530
There are also services.

22
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,821
So if you're building an app or

23
00:01:25,821 --> 00:01:31,641
a game where there are services that you
need to offer that aren't necessarily

24
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:36,504
something that you can do really
quickly within the game itself.

25
00:01:36,504 --> 00:01:41,224
Perhaps there's a superior level of
support if you're offering an app that's

26
00:01:41,224 --> 00:01:46,420
a little bit more sophisticated, that's
another type of IAP that you can offer.

27
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,700
Finally, there's subscriptions.

28
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,608
If you're doing an app that functions
a bit more like a magazine or

29
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:57,025
a game that requires a multiplayer
subscription in order to play online.

30
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:59,130
This is where subscriptions lie.

31
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,390
They're probably the least popular,

32
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,040
just because the use cases
are a little bit more limited.

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,060
But they're no less valuable

34
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,020
than any of the other types
of IAP's that you can offer.

35
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,720
So IAP's can be consumable,
use them once and that's it.

36
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,890
They can be non-consumable, so something
like an additional map pack that

37
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,020
somebody should always have
access to is a non-consumable.

38
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,910
There are different types of
subscriptions that you can offer,

39
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,620
you can offer a free subscription,

40
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,720
an auto-renewing subscription,
a non-renewing subscription.

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,720
And it really depends on what you think
people are most likely to purchase.

42
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,410
And all of this can be tested, so

43
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,870
you don't have to determine right
off the bat how this is going to go.

44
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,270
When you're selecting IAP's,

45
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,810
it's important to select
a wide range of price points.

46
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,960
Anything from the lowest
up to the highest.

47
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,988
Somebody will always buy whatever
that highest point IAP is, and

48
00:02:55,988 --> 00:02:59,136
there's no reason to prevent
yourself from getting that revenue.

49
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:02,502
Even if it might seem a little absurd
that somebody wants to spend $99 on

50
00:03:02,502 --> 00:03:03,470
a coin pack.

51
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,410
There will be somebody who inevitably
wants to spend $99 on a coin pack.

52
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,180
It's important to offer that range,

53
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,880
all the way from the lowest to the
highest, and then a good mix in between.

54
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,415
Amazon generally recommends at least
12 price points, I think that might

55
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:23,326
be a little overkill, but somewhere in
that neighborhood is probably right.

56
00:03:23,326 --> 00:03:25,170
Finally, for any of your IAP's,

57
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,060
it's extremely important that
the non-consumables can be restored.

58
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,010
You get a lot of backlash from the
platforms if you have all of these IAP's

59
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,590
that people are purchasing, yet they
can't get them back on their device.

60
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,010
You also see a significant
user backlash there which

61
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,860
won't be good in the long run.
