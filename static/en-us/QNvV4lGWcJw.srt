00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's get started on this by looking at the test cases instead of the code.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Our buggy program worked fine when row 0 had the duplicates,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but it didn't work well when row 1 had the duplicates.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So, probably we're not handling the row correctly.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's go up and see if that intuition pans out. In fact, it does.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We're looping over all of the rows in range size.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But if you look down in this code, although we introduced the variable row, we never really use it.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Just use it over here. We're not using in all that much.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Remember, I want to check to see that all of the numbers in these row are unique within that row.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Conceptually, that's two references to row and I only see one over here.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The bug in this code is that we're always checking the 0 true board.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We should be checking the current row against itself,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and that single word fix causes us to get the answers as we works on.
