1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,190
So, we're back. What's the answer Micheal? How many rows do we have?

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,350
>> So if it was just one variable we're splitting on, then

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,039
it need to be true or false, so, that's two rows. If it

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,650
was two variables, then there's four combinations and three, would be eight,

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,700
combinations. So, generalizing the end, it ought to be 2 to the n.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,480
>> That's exactly right, there are 2 to the

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,230
n different rows. And, that's what always happen when

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,350
we're dealing with n, you know, n attributes, n

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,170
boolean attributes. There's always 2 to the n possibility.

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,980
Okay, so I get just halfway there and I get to

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,720
your point about, combinatorial choices, among

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,760
the attributes. But ,that's only the

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,130
number of rows that we have. There's another question ,we need

14
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,300
to ask which is, exactly how big is the truth table itself?
