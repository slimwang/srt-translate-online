00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,600
I just wanted to have you look at this concept a little bit more in detail,

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,340
I've given you, basically, three different signals, A and B and C.

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,900
And this is the original signal.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,320
And in essence, what basically this is a 600 by

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,890
600 image which has basically a white bar in the middle and black.

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:26,410
So this is black, white, black, and I have only showed the signal as I this way.

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,310
And of course, there is filtering going on, so there is a ramp from black to

8
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,780
white, so you've noticed 0, goes up to 1, and then comes down to 0.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:41,980
The same image, I've basically then given 0.1 of the magnitude noise in there,

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,520
you can see a lot of you know,

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,780
noisy pixels coming in, and of course I've increased the noise.

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,130
I just want you to look at these three and

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,780
figure out, which is the right derivative for each one of them?

14
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,580
Just put the no, the character of the choices A, B and

15
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,360
C in the appropriate boxes.
