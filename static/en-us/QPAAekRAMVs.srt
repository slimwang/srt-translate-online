1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,150
So, to summarize this, we brought together concepts of convolution and

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:09,100
correlation, specifically cross-correlation, to compute image gradience,

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,550
use that to compute image edges, we talked about how smoothing, is important

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,460
in computing gradience, and I showed four different ways of actually using,

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,850
a specific type of kernel and a pipeline to compute edges from images.

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,840
Next, we're going to take a little bit of a different turn in our work, so

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,800
far, we've been talking a lot about images, we're going to go back and

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,240
now talk about cameras, optics, and lenses, this will allow us to

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,931
start thinking about the computation photography pipeline, and

10
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:41,411
a little bit more carefully, and then we'll actually return back to edges and

11
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:45,250
its detection, as we get into whole concept of feature matching.

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,490
We'll also be looking at very ideal ways we can actually look at an image not

13
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:53,230
just at its own scale of resolution but also multiple resolutions of the image.

14
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:56,457
More exciting stuff is on the way.
