1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,200
In many cases, we ask users to
type out the same information,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,960
even when the website
has their information.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,220
For example, think about name, address,

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,260
telephone number, email,
credit card, etc.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,730
Would it be cool to offer a shortcut
that saves time, typing, and money?

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,840
>> Yeah.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,220
You know, retailers often use past
orders to suggest future inputs.

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,800
Because once they've
already collected and

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,400
saved your address why ask for it again?

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,890
>> Yeah, and it makes life less
frustrating for your users.

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,420
It also a good idea to ask permission.

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,830
For example Amazon ask
which saves address to use.

13
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,060
But be careful.

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,860
If your application fills in too much,
users might get the wrong information.

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,320
For example, shipping your
package to the wrong address.

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,640
Remember, reusing information
will make your forms faster.
