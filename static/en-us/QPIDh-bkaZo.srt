00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,080
In the last lecture,
we proved the Cook-Levin theorem

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,689
which shows that CNF
satisfiability is MP complete.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,954
We argued directly that arbitrary

4
00:00:08,954 --> 00:00:12,860
MP can return into the satisfiability
problem with efficient reduction.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,610
Of course, it is possible to
make such a direct argument for

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,040
every MP complete problem.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,970
But usually this is not necessary.

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,910
Once we have one MP complete problem,
we can simply reduce it to

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,250
other problems to show that they,
too are MP complete.

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,090
In this lesson we use this
strategy to prove that a few more

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,720
problems are MP complete.

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,250
The goal is to give you a sense
of the breathe of the class of MP

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,290
complete problems, and introduce some of
the techniques used in those reductions.
