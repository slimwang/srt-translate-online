00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,022
Let's look at another equation. This time I'd like you to find the roots of y

2
00:00:05,022 --> 00:00:10,384
plus 10 equals negative 2 times the quantity x minus 3, squared. When you write

3
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:15,568
the solutions to this equation, I'd like you to write them as compactly as you

4
00:00:15,568 --> 00:00:20,275
can, and also to use the standard form for complex numbers, a plus bi.
