1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,790
For this question an always
on activity is ideal here.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,170
You want to be able to glance
at the stats during the run and

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,140
don't want the activity to go away.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,080
But you can dismiss it
when you finish the run,

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,560
returning to your standard watch face.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,564
For this question it's notification.

7
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:15,640
Stock prices can change slowly and

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,620
there's no need to keep
checking the watch.

9
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,410
The best strategy is to show
notification when the threshold has been

10
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,240
exceeded so
the user doesn't have to keep looking.

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,360
This one, it's regular activity.

12
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,070
If you want to look at some detailed
information, a regular activity is fine.

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,530
Once you're done, the activity
will automatically dismiss itself.

14
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,360
For this one,

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,330
notifications are the best way to find
out if there are new emails or messages.

16
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,050
The notification will vibrate when
something interesting happens.

17
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,400
There's no need for the user to keep
checking the display themselves.

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,530
For this one, probably a watch face.

19
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,640
Watch faces run 24 hours a day.

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,350
So if you want to track the steps
you take everyday of your life,

21
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,660
having this on your watch face
is probably a good place so

22
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,130
you don't have to keep
starting up another activity.

23
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,260
For this one,
it's probably watch face as well.

24
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,070
Watch faces run 24 hours a day.

25
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,130
So if you're the kind of person who
wants to see your calendar all the time,

26
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,050
a watch face might be a good idea.

27
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,060
You could use a color coded ring around
the edge to indicate your busy and

28
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,060
free times over the coarse of the day.

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,840
Or some other kind of non visualization
that doesn't involve showing

30
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,520
text everywhere
