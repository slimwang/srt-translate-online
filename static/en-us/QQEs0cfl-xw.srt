1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,780
Okay, so here's another example
of mechanism design and

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,650
I'm going to basically
break it into two bits.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:10,060
I'm going to see if I can remind you
of a particular mechanism design that

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,602
somebody famous once used in
a story told in the Bible, and

5
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:16,584
then point out that that's
kind of ridiculous.

6
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:17,464
>> [LAUGH]
>> And then we're going to

7
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:18,870
come up with something slightly better.

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,720
Does that seem fair?

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,867
>> I'm interested to see this, sure.

10
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:24,420
>> Okay, so
this is the story of King Solomon.

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,460
I drew King Solomon to look
remarkably like Curly.

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,110
>> Fun.

13
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,013
>> Yeah.
>> I get to be King Solomon, finally,

14
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:30,356
after all this time
>> You get to be King Solomon.

15
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:32,755
So do you remember
the story of King Solomon?

16
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:33,880
>> Yeah, he was wise.

17
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,563
>> Okay, okay, let's go with that.

18
00:00:35,563 --> 00:00:39,067
So then tell me the story of King
Solomon and the two women and the baby.

19
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:43,883
>> All right, so once upon a time
King Solomon was hanging around on his

20
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:48,193
throne doing kingly things and
he would answer questions for

21
00:00:48,193 --> 00:00:53,260
the various people in the country
that he ruled, Judah, maybe?

22
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,720
>> Sure, let's go with that.

23
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,242
>> But he was known for
being very wise, so

24
00:00:57,242 --> 00:01:00,997
people would come up to him
with very difficult problems.

25
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:07,751
So one of the difficult problems was
two women came to him with a baby and

26
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:12,673
each of the women claimed
the baby was her baby, and

27
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:17,280
they could not come to
any kind of agreement.

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,510
One of them it was actually the baby,
the other one was someone who really

29
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,480
wanted a baby, couldn't have a baby and
then took someone else's baby.

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,520
And so this is not the sort of
thing you want to get wrong,

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,030
giving somebody's baby to
somebody who's not their mom.

32
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,970
>> Right, so, let's see.

33
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:31,962
So there are two women,

34
00:01:31,962 --> 00:01:34,640
we gotta give them names because I'm
having a hard time keeping track.

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,350
So, let's just call them A and B.

36
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,460
A for Alice and B for-
>> Bob.

37
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,656
>> Bob.
That makes perfect sense.

38
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:42,600
>> Wait, no, Beth.

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,290
>> Beth, okay, so Alice and Beth.

40
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,870
And then there's a baby.

41
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,440
And so Alice comes to King Solomon,
says Beth stole my baby.

42
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,144
And then Beth comes to King Solomon and
says, Alice stole my baby.

43
00:01:54,144 --> 00:01:56,802
And then the baby just goes, ga,
because that's what babies do.

44
00:01:56,802 --> 00:01:58,210
See this little curly hair thing?

45
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,190
>> Yeah, that's cool.

46
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,830
>> And now King Solomon does what?

47
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:07,510
>> So King Solomon checks whether
the baby is named A or B and then

48
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,960
can actually trace the genetic roots of
the baby back to the appropriate mother.

49
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,786
>> No, that was an episode of CSI.

50
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:16,109
What does the story claim happened?

51
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:17,310
>> Yes, I'm sorry.

52
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,432
So King Solomon says, all right,
I've thought about this a lot and

53
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:25,119
I've decided that the only fair
way of dividing up the baby is

54
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:28,473
by dividing up the baby,
giving half to A and half to B.

55
00:02:28,473 --> 00:02:33,175
And so that was what he claims he's
going to do, and he calls for his royal

56
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:37,797
sword person to bring a sword and
he gets ready to cut the baby in half,

57
00:02:37,797 --> 00:02:42,726
at which point A-
>> [LAUGH] I recognize that royal sword.

58
00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:46,572
[LAUGH] It's a Jedi.

59
00:02:46,572 --> 00:02:50,410
All right, so the royal sword
person says, okay, I will

60
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,200
bring you the royal sword, and Solomon
gets ready to cut the baby in half.

61
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,803
And suddenly woman A cries out,
no, don't do it.

62
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,940
B can have the baby.

63
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,576
>> No.

64
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:03,701
>> Yes.

65
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:06,070
>> And so B gets to keep the baby.

66
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,196
>> I don't think that's what happened.

67
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:11,712
>> No, so then King Solomon says aha,
I set this up all along.

68
00:03:11,712 --> 00:03:14,370
I never really was going to
kill the baby, let's say.

69
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,329
And instead what I wanted to find out
is who really cared for the baby,

70
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:23,460
this particular baby, and that would
be the particular baby's actual mother.

71
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,417
So the thought was that the mom
would rather have the baby live and

72
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:30,273
be with a different mom
than be sliced in half,

73
00:03:30,273 --> 00:03:33,513
which would probably
complicate the baby's life.

74
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,216
>> Yeah, actually I think it would
simplify the baby's life, but

75
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,829
okay, I'm with you on that, right.

76
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:41,364
And then King Solomon could
just determine that, in fact,

77
00:03:41,364 --> 00:03:42,438
A was the mother.

78
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:48,756
>> And, yes, sewed the baby back up and
gave the baby to A and sent B to prison?

79
00:03:48,756 --> 00:03:49,610
>> I don't remember.
>> I don't know.

80
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,730
Maybe he had a baby with B for B's sake.

81
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,810
I don't know.

82
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,770
That's not really part
of the story in my head.

83
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,153
The point, A leaves with the baby,
A is happy.

84
00:03:58,153 --> 00:03:59,274
B is disappointed but not so

85
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:02,230
disappointed because there's
plenty of other babies to steal.

86
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,406
>> Right, and then of course there's
the poor swordsman who didn't even

87
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:05,105
get to cut up a baby.

88
00:04:05,105 --> 00:04:08,190
>> [LAUGH]
>> Okay, so this is-

89
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,260
>> He does look disappointed.

90
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,280
>> I do, or he does, sorry.

91
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,950
He does look very, very disappointed.

92
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,884
Very sad, in fact there's a single tear.
