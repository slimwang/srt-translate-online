00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,370
Consider this graph.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,969
Let's call it G.

3
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:07,090
Suppose I tell you that I computed
a matching in order to generate a coarse

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,870
graph, G hat.

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,280
Here's G hat.

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,170
Here's what I want you to do.

7
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,010
Find a maximal matching in
G that would lead to G hat.

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,950
Do that by checking off
the edges of the matching in G.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,380
For instance, if you wanted a matching
that included this edge and

10
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,740
this edge, then you would check
off this edge and this edge.
