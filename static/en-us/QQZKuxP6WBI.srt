00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,036
The answer is interpolate.

2
00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:07,442
Interpolating snapToRoads requests.

3
00:00:07,442 --> 00:00:12,820
When you pass up to 100 Lat/Lng points,
not addresses, into a Roads

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:18,903
snapToRoads request, you can choose to
turn those 100 into many more points,

5
00:00:18,903 --> 00:00:24,036
to give you a fuller and clearer
picture of the road you travelled on.

6
00:00:24,036 --> 00:00:28,348
However, if you have very few,
very widespread points,

7
00:00:28,347 --> 00:00:32,307
interpolation may not give
you an accurate picture.

8
00:00:32,307 --> 00:00:35,191
The more data, the better.

9
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:40,027
All of these specifics can be found
in our developer documentation linked

10
00:00:40,027 --> 00:00:40,573
below.

11
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:43,005
Now, let's get back to
our real estate app.
