00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,680
Let's check out how to use
Shape Renderer to draw some points.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,590
I don't just want to show things
off of my computer, though.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,650
I want you to follow along
on your own machine.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,430
Let's walk through loading up
a libgdx project one more time,

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,540
just to make sure you
got the hang of it.

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,620
So we'll open up Android Studio,

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,320
close everything until you
get to this flash screen.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,670
Go to import project.

9
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,390
We'll navigate to the ud405
folder that you downloaded

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,640
earlier and
then open up 1.3.01-Demo-DrawingPoints.

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,200
Now Android Studio and cradle will
think about things for a bit.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
All right, there we go,
we're all loaded up.

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,390
Now let's set up our desktop
ring configuration again.

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,790
We click on the right
configuration drop down.

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:47,430
Hit edit configurations,
hit the plus button, select Gradle,

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,050
give our new run configuration
the name Desktop and

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,550
then give it the task, desktop run.

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,920
Then one more thing so

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,040
we can see the files we're working with,
we'll open up the project pane.

20
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,920
Then switch this drop down
from Android to Project.

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,610
Awesome, now we're ready to get started.

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,810
Walk through these steps again and
we'll get to some actual drawing.
