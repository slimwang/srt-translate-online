00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,411
You've seen how arrays can store a sequence of values such as this one. Here we

2
00:00:05,411 --> 00:00:10,221
have three prices for three different kinds of gasoline. Well, what if we have

3
00:00:10,221 --> 00:00:13,805
two gas stations in this case you'll want to store a two dimensional

4
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:19,870
arrangement with rows and columns, two dimensional arrays can do that. In this

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:24,199
example we would have three rows and two columns. In Java we get such a

6
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,039
arrangement by saying, give me a new array of doubles, of floating point

7
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:33,780
numbers and I want three rows, two columns. In general, the first number is the

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,514
number of rows, the second one the number of columns. Note the type, it's a

9
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:43,663
double brackets brackets meaning, it's a two dimensional array, of numbers. If

10
00:00:43,663 --> 00:00:47,303
you already know which numbers should go into the two dimensional array, then

11
00:00:47,303 --> 00:00:52,334
you can supply them like this. Again, here I have a two dimensional array, of

12
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:57,880
prices. And now, you put a, pair of braces, for the entire array, and then for

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:04,870
each row you put another pair of braces with the values. So here we have three

14
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,715
rows, each of which is enclosed in a pair of braces. Now you know how to

15
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:13,470
declare a two-dimensional array. Next let's have a look at how we can access

16
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,999
its elements.
