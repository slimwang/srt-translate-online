00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,480
As you start writing apps,
especially data driven apps,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,680
working with p lists in
JSON is an everyday task.

00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,980
You'll use these formats to load data on
devices and communicate over a network.

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,290
So they're extremely valuable to know.

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,360
See you in the next session.
