00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,070
So now that we have seen how to access the BTB, let's do a quiz.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:09,540
Let's say we have a BTB with 1,024 entries. Note that these entries

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,051
will be number 0 through 1,023. Let's say that this particular architecture uses

4
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:21,170
fixed-size 4-byte instructions that have to be word-aligned. Which means,

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:26,418
an instruction needs to begin at the divisible by four address. So,

6
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:29,760
an instruction can be at address 0, 4, 8, etc.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,696
But it cannot be at addresses something like 3, or 5, or 17. And

8
00:00:34,696 --> 00:00:39,973
let's say that the program counter is a 32-bit register, meaning that this

9
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:46,660
particular processor uses 32-bit instruction addresses. The question for you,

10
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:53,360
is which BTB entry, again, they're numbered from 0 to 1,023, should be used for

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,540
PC, whose address is x0000AB0C? Write your answer here.

12
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:06,494
Again, the answer should be between 0 and 1023.
