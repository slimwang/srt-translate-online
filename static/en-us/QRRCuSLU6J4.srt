00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,850
When you implement a method, you can make use of a special variable called this

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:10,266
that references this very object on which a method is called. Here's what I

3
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:14,516
mean. Look at this method call. It has an argument, number ten, and that

4
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:19,448
argument gets copied into this parameter variable. So now distance is ten, and

5
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:23,829
whenever you use distance, that means ten. Now, when you look at this car, it

6
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:28,480
really has two ingredients, the number ten but also the particular car. And

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,890
every method in Java has a secret parameter called this that's not actually

8
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,370
declare in the method but, in any call, it references the object to the left of

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:43,641
the dot. Now, what's the use? If you like, you can add this in front of every

10
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:53,824
instance variable. Let's clean it up a little. So, now it becomes very clear

11
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:57,667
that it's the miles driven of this car that are set to the miles driven of this

12
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:04,370
car plus the distance. And the distance was a parameter variable. It's optional

13
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,780
to use this but some people like it a lot because it makes it very clear, which

14
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:15,569
are the instance variables and which ones are local or parameter variables. A

15
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:20,123
bit of terminology by the way, this is sometimes called the implicit parameter

16
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:25,540
because it's never declared. It's implicit in the definition of a method. And a

17
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,524
parameter such as this one here is called an explicit parameter. Why don't you

18
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:34,354
give it a try? Here in this drive method, go ahead and add this everywhere that

19
00:01:34,354 --> 00:01:38,222
your allowed to do so. How many times did you get to add this and did you like

20
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:41,420
it better this way? No wrong answer, I'd just like to know.
