00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,969
So, for all of this, basically what I am doing is I'm

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:07,570
collecting the value of the input using by using the .val method.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:12,380
And, I am collecting the h1, which is the h1 that we want to change.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,940
Then, all we have to do is set the text of h1 to the value

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,750
that we got right up here.

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,580
Once we do that, we can scroll down and

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,650
we can have some fun changing the title of the articles.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,310
That wasn't too hard.

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,860
