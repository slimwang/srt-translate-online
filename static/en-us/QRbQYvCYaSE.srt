1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,260
In the onReceive that you've just
implemented, you got a context and

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,550
an intent.

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,109
Now remember earlier when you
broadcasted the detected activities,

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,750
you created an array list
of detected activities and

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,100
you put them into the intent.

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,220
See now if you can create a new array
list of detected activities and

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,240
get them out of the intent.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,460
And here's a hint, you can use the get
parcelable array list extra method.

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,830
On the intent to do it.

10
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,010
Check out the documentation for that.

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:27,730
But that's the key.

12
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,580
Now, once you've done this, you're going
to easily iterate through this array

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,510
list of detected activities, and you
can get their type using the getType.

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,170
Once you've done this you can iterate
through the DetectedActivity objects in

15
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,200
the ArrayList.

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,220
Getting their type and the confidence
for this type using the getType and

17
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,310
getConfidence methods.

18
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,720
Note that getType will actually
return a code and not the string for

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,080
the activity.

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,210
You can find these codes on
the DetectedActivity class.

21
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,070
Go ahead now and write a helper function
that turns this code into a string,

22
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,420
and then implement
this on your onReceive.

23
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,780
When you're done, check this box.
