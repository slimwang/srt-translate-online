00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,855
Now that we have our given information and the goal of our problem laid out

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:07,761
explicitly, we can work toward creating and equation to help describe the

3
00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:11,740
situation. I'd like you to use these quantities down here to create a word

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,617
equation in these blanks. I've made things a little bit easier for you and

5
00:00:15,617 --> 00:00:19,871
filled in operators already. So please, in each of these blanks, put the letter

6
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:23,428
of the quantity down here that you think belongs in that position.
