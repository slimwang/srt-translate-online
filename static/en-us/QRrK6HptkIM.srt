So we have just a few more terms left to discuss in classical conditioning. So

00:00:04,128 --> 00:00:07,239
here we see the repeated process of pairing the neutral stimulus with the

3
00:00:07,239 --> 00:00:12,040
unconditioned stimulus, is a process called acquisition. And it occurs after

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,379
several trials.
