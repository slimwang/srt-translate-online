1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,620
In persistent connections multiple HTTP requests and

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,260
responses are multiplex onto a single TCP

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:13,270
connection. Delimiters at the end of an HTTP request indicates the end of a

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,480
request and the content length allows the

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,740
receiver to identify how long a response

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,730
is. So, the server actually has to know the size of the transfer in advance.

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,330
Persistent connections can also be combined with

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,900
something call pipelining. In pipelining, a client

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,830
sends the next request as soon as it encounters a referenced object. So there's

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,560
as little as one round trip time for all referenced objects before they began

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,920
to be fetched. Persistent connections with pipelining

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,811
is the deafult behavior in, HTTP 1.1.
