If I distribute the positive 40 to 3 8th y, I'll get 40 times 3 8th y. And if I

2
00:00:05,336 --> 00:00:10,856
distribute the 40 to the negative 17 8th, I'll get 40 times negative 17 8th. Be

3
00:00:10,868 --> 00:00:16,234
sure you carry the minus sign. Reducing a common factor of 8 gives us 5 here and

4
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:21,071
1 here. The same is true on this fraction, 5 times 3 is 15 over one.

5
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:26,253
So, I just have 15, and then y. On the right side, I have 5 times negative 17,

6
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,942
which is negative 85. This is amazing if you got this right. If you remember how

7
00:00:31,954 --> 00:00:36,246
to work your fractions and reduce common factors, great work.
