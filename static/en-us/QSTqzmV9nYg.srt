00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,100
So now that we have our text in place
for our ad, we need to add our keywords.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,689
These are the foundation
of your ad group.

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:10,460
Your ad has a possibility of
appearing in the top search results

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,620
when people search these keywords.

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,720
Google recommends starting with 10
to 20 keywords that are specific to

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,740
phrases that your potential
customers may use when searching for

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,450
your product or service.

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,820
Google also recommends
avoiding 1 word keywords.

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,810
Which if you think about it makes sense.

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,550
Imagine if we use the keyword, dog.

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,100
Think of everything that
can be related to that.

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,275
Dog health info, blogs about dogs,
news articles relating to dogs.

13
00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:43,025
Videos of dogs, things on Animal Planet,
buying a dog, cute dog pictures,

14
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:48,855
hot dogs, being sick as a dog, getting
a little hair of the dog, dog whistles,

15
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:53,760
dog parks types of dogs, I could go
on but I think you get the picture.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,370
Non of these have anything
to do with dog sitting.

17
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,860
To avoid that chaos you can use
Google Trends Keyword Planner

18
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,010
that we went over previously to help you
choose the keyboards you want to use.

19
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,640
So let's send in our keywords.

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,290
After we've filled out our app, I'm
going to scroll down to make keywords.

21
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,230
We'll go with dog sitting, luxury
dog sitting, dog care, pet sitting,

22
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:18,570
pet care, home dog sitting,
in home dog sitting, dog services,

And we can add more.

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,710
Before we move on let's hear from Chris,

26
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,130
a marketing expert about
choosing keywords, and

27
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,820

figuring out our budget and bidding.

28
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,280
