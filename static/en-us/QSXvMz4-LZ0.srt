The two lines of this graphs is never going to cross are y equals 0. The x axis

00:00:06,153 --> 00:00:11,010
over here and x equals 0. Now I didn't draw these two lines perfectly. But in

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,296
reality the graph of y equals 1 over x just gets super, super close to both of

00:00:14,296 --> 00:00:18,709
the axes. But it never, ever touches them. That's really cool.
