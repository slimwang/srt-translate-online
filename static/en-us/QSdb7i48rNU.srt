1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,680
So let's talk a little bit
about scene reconstruction.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,420
The whole purpose of scene
reconstruction is to automatically

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,430
estimate the position, orientation and
focal length of cameras.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,530
We also then want to
be able to model and

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,110
extract 3D positions of feature points.

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,460
I'm not going to get into a lot of
details about basically how we can get

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,200
to focal length of cameras in fact,
Noah Snavely, on his website,

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,580
has a very nice tool to bundle our.

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,140
That actually let's you do this kind of
stuff with variety of different types of

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,130
methods and
pictures that you upload to it.

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,040
I will actually make available to
you some other resources to look at

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,190
how to do this kind of
camera calibration.

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,890
But we, kind of, skipping that for now,

14
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,480
because the kind of stuff we
need to do would be basically,

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,119
we'll be able to move forward without
getting into those types of details.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,970
So what we really want to do to be able
to automatically estimate is first we

17
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,520
want to do feature detection,
something we have talked about before.

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,490
Then we basically want to do a little
bit of matching of features, something

19
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,880
again we have looked at before,
and we will talk about again now.

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,280
Using this we want to be able
to find correspondences.

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,140
Remember we talked about correspondences
a lot when we talked about stereo.

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,840
We needed to find two points in an image
that allowed us to then actually compute

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,610
a disparity map, which would be
then used to create a depth map or

24
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,930
a depth image that we can actually use
the extract depth arrange of an image.

25
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,840
Same concept, now we want to do this not
just with two images but a lot more.

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,470
And again, we want to run to something
called structure from motion,

27
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,810
I'll talk a little about that next,
in a few minutes.
