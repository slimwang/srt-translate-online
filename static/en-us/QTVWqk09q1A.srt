00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,927
You've seen that in the normal distribution, by knowing where on the x axis the

2
00:00:05,927 --> 00:00:11,842
value falls, in terms of standard deviation, we can determine the percentage

3
00:00:11,842 --> 00:00:17,722
less than or greater than any value. In this lesson you are going to calculate

4
00:00:17,722 --> 00:00:23,471
these percentages. Remember that we used theoretical curve to model the data and

5
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:28,511
the area under this curve is one, that's because it models with relative

6
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:33,769
frequency of a distribution of data in terms of proportions. This curve is

7
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:38,775
called the probability density function which we often abbreviate PDF.
