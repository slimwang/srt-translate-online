1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So if we're going to generate random keys,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
we need some understanding of what randomness is.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is a very deep, philosophical question,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and I'm not much of a philosopher,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
so let's try a quiz instead.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So the question is which of these sequences is the most random?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So here are the sequences.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I won't try to read them,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
but see if you can figure out which one of these is the most random.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And I should warn you in advance

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
this is a bit of a trick question,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
if you haven't already decided that.
