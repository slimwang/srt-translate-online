00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,930
If we plug negative 3 into the function for x, we end up with negative 60 as a

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,974
value of the function. So this should be, based on what we've seen before, the

3
00:00:08,974 --> 00:00:13,913
remainder that we get and we divide this by x plus 3. Let's see if it actually

4
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:17,586
works. And, sure enough, completing our long division, we get a remainder of

5
00:00:17,586 --> 00:00:18,851
negative 60.
