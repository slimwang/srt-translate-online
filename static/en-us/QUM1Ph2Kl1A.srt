1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
Now, we already talked about the notion of polynomial running time

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:10,280
being associated with tractability and exponential running time being associated with intractability

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,650
can lead to some borderline cases where you would probably argue.

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:23,350
For example, if you had an algorithm that had polynomial running time of O(n¹⁰)

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:30,460
and you had an exponential running time algorithm with running time 1.01^n,

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:37,130
then actually it would be very hard to decide which one of these algorithms to take.

7
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,850
It would kind of depend on additional information.

8
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,210
What other constant factors here and what is the size of the n.

9
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,260
As I mentioned before, this hardly occurs in practice and this hardly occurs in practice as well.

10
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,650
Tractable problems are usually really tractable

11
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,760
and intractable problems tend to be intractable in general,

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,730
but in later units, we'll actually see how you can deal with exponential running times.

13
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:07,960
The question we're now dealing with is both for Alice's problem and Bob's problem.

14
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,830
Are they intractable or can we find a polynomial time algorithm

15
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,390
that would show us that these problems are tractable?

16
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:22,570
So far Alice and Bob really don't have a good idea on how to tackle that problem.

17
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,460
That's why they actually decides to get together

18
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,690
and discuss with each other the problems that they are trying to solve,

19
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:34,720
and to that meeting, they also invites a friend of theirs,

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,840
and that friend of theirs is Carol because as they have learned

21
00:01:38,840 --> 99:59:59,999
Carol is also working on a problem that so far she has only found an exponential time algorithm for.
