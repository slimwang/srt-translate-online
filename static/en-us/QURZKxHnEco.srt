00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,260
So how would scripts help inform the design of an agent to solve Raven's

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,090
progressive matrices? Remember,

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,060
scripts are ways of making sense of complex events in the world and

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,390
we can certainly consider individual Raven's matrices to be complex situations.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,309
You thus might have a script for different broad categories of Raven's problems.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,230
If this was your approach, what would your entry conditions be for each script?

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,070
What would the tracks be? What would the scenes be? Where are these scripts

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,670
going to come from? Are you going to tell the agent what script it should use or

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,710
will it learn a script from prior problems? If the agent succeeds using

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,480
the script that you give it, who is intelligent? You or your agent?
