00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,070
Let's begin by creating
a new project for our app.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,933
It will be similar to the hello world
app that you created with Laila early on

3
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:08,870
in practice set one.

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,110
See if you can remember how
to set it up on your own.

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,770
Use these settings for app name,
package name, etcetera.

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,440
So that your code will match ours for
the rest of this lesson.

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:20,867
Once it's done being created.

8
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:23,049
Make sure you can run
the app on your device.

9
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:25,200
It should look something like this.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,130
The name of the app is shown at
the top in the app bar and below that,

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,580
we have the words, hello world.
