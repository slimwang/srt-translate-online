1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now the last thing I think I really want to mention

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and it really does belong in this lecture

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
is the affect of market type on revenue.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is really interesting, because you might have heard about startups

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
about something called the hockey stick,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and the hockey stick is actually this kind of curve.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now, it turns out that what the hockey stick really represents

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
are startups in a new market. Wow. That's kind of interesting. Why?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, if you think about it, in a new market on year 1

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
you have no customers, and so your revenue is essentially flat.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
In year 2, revenue still might be flat.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Year 3, it might be flat.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Year 4, oh my gosh, something changed about the market.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There might be a tipping point, an inflection point,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
where sales literally go exponential and start to skyrocket.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What happened is a market that didn't exist all things have just come together,

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and it's become the year of online education,

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
or it's become the year of the network,

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
or it's become the year of the mobile phone or smart phone.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The unfortunate part is most startups that are in a new market

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
see something that looks like this and go out of business.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What we're really hoping for is that we could influence and affect

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
this tipping point by our customer strategies, our value proposition,

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and our get, keep, and grow strategies.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But the key idea is we want to hoard as much cash as we can,

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
because almost no startup in a new market can affect the diffusion of innovation by itself.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Other things need to happen.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
By the way, this little bump in year one—

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
this represents the fallacy in new markets.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
In almost every new market you could find crazy people just like you

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
who'd be happy to buy one for their lab or their home.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Such early adopters—they want to have one.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Startup founders look at that curve and say, "Look! It's just going to look like this,"

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and start scaling their sales and marketing and spending and then it all collapses again,

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
because it really was an early adopter sign, not mainstream adoption.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We want to be careful about what our sales curve looks like.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Now, what's really interesting is if we're an existing market—

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and remember, in an existing market what do we know?

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Well, there are customers and there are competitors.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What we have if by our definition a better or higher performance product

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
on axes that the customers have defined.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Our job in an existing market is simply year-after-year,

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
if we execute pristinely, simply to take share away from the incumbents.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So, our sales curve in an existing market literally should be one of taking shares.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Finally, in a resegmented market, this is kind of a hybrid of both new and existing.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What's happening in years 1, 2, 3, etc, in the early days

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
is you're actually getting revenue from the existing markets.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That is, people might actually kind of find you are an okay substitute,

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
but really don't understand your unique value

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
until some tipping point where they realize, oh my gosh, you're just not another vendor

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
in an existing market, you actually solve better a set of needs for a niche

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
or you're a low-cost supplier that really makes you unique and special

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and revenues take off.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And so what you have to do is husband your cash but not as much in a new market

55
00:03:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and figure out how to get you differentiated from the mainstream in existence.
