1
00:00:00,236 --> 00:00:02,818
Now the tricky part starts at n equals two and

2
00:00:02,818 --> 00:00:04,894
I will construct this for you, you can take over

3
00:00:04,894 --> 00:00:07,721
for three and four. For the one of the left

4
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:10,361
to have the sum equal to one, we stay at one,

5
00:00:10,361 --> 00:00:13,274
which is we add up the value above and the two

6
00:00:13,274 --> 00:00:15,247
on the left because there’s no three outcomes.

7
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:18,836
This guy over here is two, it’s the one above

8
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:20,372
and the two in the left, there’s nothing over

9
00:00:20,372 --> 00:00:22,195
here but there is something over here.

10
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:24,863
This guy here is three, it’s a sum over the one

11
00:00:24,863 --> 00:00:27,668
above and the two on the left gives us three.

12
00:00:27,668 --> 00:00:30,111
We go down to two, which is a one above zero

13
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:32,731
and the two on the left, all the way back to one.

14
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:34,979
And this already looks very much like the

15
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:38,979
type distribution we talked about like this.
