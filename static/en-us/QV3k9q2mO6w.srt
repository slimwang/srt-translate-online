00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,690
So here the instructions with a quiz.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,430
First, I like you to open up
the court counter app and

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,920
you can download it from the the
instruction notes below if you need it.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,340
Next, enter some
information to the app and

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,108
then afterwards,
close the app off completely.

6
00:00:14,108 --> 00:00:18,750
So these means going into the all
app screen and then swiping it away.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,410
Lastly, reopen the app and
see what happens.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,360
After you've tried these instructions,
go ahead and answer this question.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,190
Did you notice anything strange?

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,020
Perhaps, the data you entered initially
was missing after you reopened it or

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,980
maybe the colors of the application
has changed slightly.

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,620
Or maybe even the menu
bar has disappeared or

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,340
perhaps the buttons in the app
are no longer responding to touch.

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,260
Give these instructions a try and
then move on to the next video and

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,710
we'll see what strange things are afoot.
