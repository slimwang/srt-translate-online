You've seen some interesting interfaces with drawable and likeable, but let me

2
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:08,943
give you another very common reason why people like to use interfaces. And that

3
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:15,540
is to be able to reuse an algorithm. Consider a common algorithm to compute an

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,578
average. Here I have an array of countries, each of which has a name and an

5
00:00:20,578 --> 00:00:26,710
area. And I want to know, what is the average area of all of these countries.

6
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,014
Now of course, I could write a loop to compute that, but lets say I want to a

7
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:34,915
method that does this for any set of countries. So, I'd like you to complete

8
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:39,061
this method that takes an array of countries. For each of them, find out what

9
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:44,210
the area is simply by calling the Get Area method. Add up all those areas, and

10
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,084
then return the average.
