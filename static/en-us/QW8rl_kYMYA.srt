In addition to the genetic and environmental evidence for personality, there's

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,798
also evidence for a biological basis for personality. The psychologist Hans

3
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:14,014
Eysenck developed a biological theory of introversion and extroversion as well

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,984
as neuroticism. He proposed that differences in people's nervous systems lead

5
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:24,350
to different personality. This is most easily seen in the introversion and

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,687
extroversion dimension of personality. Eysenck argued that two qualities of the

7
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:34,490
central nervous system led to introversion and extroversion. The first is

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,061
arousal levels of the cortex. And the second is threshold for sensory

9
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:42,220
stimulation. Let's look at these a little more closely.
