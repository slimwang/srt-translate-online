1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,930
In this class, we'll be leveraging D3 to create interactive data visualizations.

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:12,700
Since D3 stands on the shoulders of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG, we

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,258
will need to get comfortable with these technologies before we start using it.

4
00:00:16,258 --> 00:00:19,630
Although it's not required to know these technologies for

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,980
this course, much of the live code and exercises will assume that you

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,330
have a basic proficiency with each of these technologies.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,870
If you don't feel comfortable with these technologies, we've included many

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,770
exercises and tutorials in the resources portion of the course or

9
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,150
in the instructor notes for each video.

10
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,590
I recommend taking a break now and

11
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,720
going to the resources section of this course now in order to

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,570
understand the code that is going to follow or if you want after this lesson

13
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,160
to brush up on anything that I may have covered that is unfamiliar to you.
