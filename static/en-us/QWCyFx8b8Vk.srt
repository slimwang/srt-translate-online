What Athena really wants to do now is to find the area of this triangle that we

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:08,127
saw at the top of the building. This quantity a in our new equation for volume.

00:00:08,127 --> 00:00:11,436
But how? Well, her life would be made much easier if she didn't have to worry

4
00:00:11,436 --> 00:00:14,649
about this side length that's tacked onto the right side of the equation, 2x

5
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:18,981
plus 8. Now, if we want to get rid of this factor of 2x plus 8 on the right

6
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:23,650
hand side. What should we do to that equation? Should we subtract 2x plus 8

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,228
from the right-hand side? Should we subtract it from both sides? Should we

8
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:31,940
divide the right-hand side by 2x plus 8, or should be divide both sides by this

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,392
factor?
