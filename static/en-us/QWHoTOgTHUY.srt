00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,290
You've done amazing work.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,110
Really, you should be proud
of all the hard work and

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,350
effort you put into learning Ember.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,350
You've worked with Ember CLI,
Ember's file structure,

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,810
the handlebars templating language,
components and

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,900
templates, consuming services, and
handling user engagement with actions.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,630
You now have a solid foundation to
continue learning more about Ember.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,030
Yep, there's still more to it, but

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,720
the Ember docs are full
of helpful information.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,250
I hope the app we created is your
first of many Ember apps to come.

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,290
As you're working on your next Ember
project, make sure to share with me, and

12
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,940
the other students in the forum.

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,200
I can't wait to see what you create.
