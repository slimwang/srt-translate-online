00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,310
I want to end this
section on computability,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,400
by revisiting the scene we used
at the beginning of the course.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,400
Where the teacher was explaining
functions in terms of ordered pairs, and

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,860
the students were thinking of what
they had to do to X in order to get Y.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,150
The promise of our study of
computability was to better appreciate

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,720
the difference between
these understandings.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,120
And I hope you will agree
that we have achieved that.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,750
We've seen how there are many
functions that are not computable

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,090
in any ordinary sense of the word,
by counting argument.

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,000
We made precise what we meant by
computation, going all the way

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,970
back to Turing's inspiration from
his own experience with pen and

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,890
paper, to formalize the Turing machine.

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,020
And we argued for the Church Turing
thesis, that this model can compute

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,710
anything that a computer today, or
any one envisioned for tomorrow can.

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,680
Lastly, we described a whole
family of uncomputable functions

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,090
through Rice's theorem.

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,410
What's next in the study
of computability?

18
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,120
Let's ask Lance.
