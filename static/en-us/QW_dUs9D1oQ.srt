Hi, this is Victor again and

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:08,600
this time I'd like to show you how I
use a screen reader on everyday basis.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,125
In this particular case I will be
using one of my daily things and

4
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:18,435
that is looking at a public forum that
talks about accessibility issues for

5
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,925
the Android operating system.

6
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:21,795
>> Open locationâ€¦ About:
blank contents selected,

7
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:24,575
Address and search bar, edit text
>> You will notice that my screen reader

8
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:26,655
speaks really fast.

9
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:30,315
As a beginner user you tend to
listen at much lower speeds.

10
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:35,290
But as you gain efficiency with the
screen reader, you will find that making

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,400
it speak faster improves efficiency
when browsing content on websites.

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,180
So back to my public form.

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,505
I'm going to go to groups website.

14
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:50,214
>> [SOUND]
[INAUDIBLE]

15
00:00:50,214 --> 00:00:52,534
>> Since I use this website every day I

16
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:57,414
know that it provides a lot of shortcut
keys That allowed me to browse this

17
00:00:57,414 --> 00:00:58,940
website much faster.

18
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,760
So first I'll go to my groups.

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,700
>> My groups, Google groups,
HTML content.

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,510
>> And now I will be using a screen
reader functionality there allows me to

21
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,980
browse through the links on this webpage

22
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,835
because I'd like to find a specific
public forum I'm looking for.

23
00:01:12,835 --> 00:01:16,900
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Here

24
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,890
you will see I have
a few message threads.

25
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,280
And quite recently I heard about
this new app called Swift.

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,670
It's a braille Keyboard that allows
people who are blind to type braille

27
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,400
faster on Android.

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,910
So I'm going to go back to
this thread and look at some

29
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:48,946
of the messages that I may have missed.

30
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:52,784
>> [INAUDIBLE]

31
00:01:52,784 --> 00:01:59,015
>> Looking at messages that

32
00:01:59,015 --> 00:02:05,847
I included in this thread.

33
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:12,821
I used again, shortcut keys to
quickly move through messages.

34
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:13,643
>> [INAUDIBLE].
I did a 10:32

Sergio Brunetti Hi all, sorry.

37
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,280
I am trying to create a new topic.

38
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,210
I sent a message in a wrong place.

39
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:17,980
I hope now it will work.

40
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,139
Group item.

41
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,614
>> Okay, this gives me some idea as to
what people may have responded since

42
00:02:22,614 --> 00:02:24,412
the last time I looked at this thread.

43
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:26,930
So I'm going to go back and see-
>> Star this topic, discussion.

44
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,730
>> If there is anything new since
the last time I looked at this forum.

45
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,600
>> Star this topic, discussion.

46
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,490
Will Talkback work on anything
that's running Adroid?

47
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,660
(5).
>> Yeah, there's quite a bit to read.

48
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,900
But anyway I hope this gives you
a quick glance into how I use this view

49
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,950
to an everyday basis.
