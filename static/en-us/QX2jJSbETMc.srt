00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,710
If you type Ctrl+C into a shell program,

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,590
the Linux system sends a signal
called interrupt to that program.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,930
Now, that worked on the PNG program,
but it doesn't work on bc.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,260
It actually gives you a message
saying (interrupt) use quit to exit.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,510
And typing quit does work,
but it's not the only way.

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,780
Remember, Ctrl+D stands for
end of file and

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,840
it tells the program that there
isn't any more input coming.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,900
So Ctrl+D also works as
a way to exit the program.

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,699
So the correct options in this quiz are
either to type quit or to press Ctrl+D.
