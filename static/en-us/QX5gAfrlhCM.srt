1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now we are in the position to write down differential equations.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We look at a single corner of that braking car.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Just a single wheel not all four wheels and just a quarter of the mass of that car.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's called the velocity of the car V and the velocity of the rim of the wheel W.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We specify the velocity of the wheel in m/s similar to how we specify the velocity of the car,

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and which will show you or rather find a discussion that uses

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
the angular velocity of the wheel and that uses the moment of inertia of the wheel,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
which gets overly complex for all purposes.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This quarter of the car exerts a certain force on the ground, namely--

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
the mass of that quarter of the car times gravitational acceleration.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
By friction, the road surface exerts this force on the wheel.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If you wonder about the direction, imagine that the wheel was locked

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and friction will put it around in a clockwise fashion.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The first thing to be computing is the wheel slip s and given these two velocities,

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
the velocity of the car and the velocity of the rim of the wheel,

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
we can compute the wheel slip by 1-W/V.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's do this. I need to check. If the wheel is lock, the velocity of its rim will be zero.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
W will become zero. What do we get? 1-0. A value of one fitting to the wheel being locked.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:35,000
If we have a perfectly rolling motion, W will be equal to V and we compute 1-1/1 which is zero.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This seems to be very plausible.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Once we've got the wheel slip, we can compute the force from friction

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and it's the coefficient of friction which again depends on the wheel slip times the force

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
perpendicular to that surface, 1/4 the mass of the car times gravitational acceleration

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and now it's time to look at the velocities.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The car is decelerated. The rate of change of the velocity of the car minus the friction force

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
divided by the mass of that 1/4 of the car.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Think about Newton's law--F=m*a. The rate of change of the velocity is the acceleration.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This our force, this is our mass, and we have to take care of that we are braking decelerating.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We get a similar equation for the velocity of the rim of the wheel.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Its rate of change increases through a friction, so we've got a plus sign now.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The mass to be used here is not the mass of this 1/4 of the car.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's rather something like the effective mass of the rear.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
In reality, we would have to take care of the circumstance that the mass of the wheel is

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
distributed over the cylinder.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
To make things simple, I'm using an effective mass here. That's my own term.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
As I said before, the typical way of dealing with this would be using angular velocities

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
with moments of inertia, which considerably complex.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let's cheat a little and introduce this effective mass of the wheel here.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
If the mass of the wheel was concentrated at its circumference,

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
then this would actually be the mass of the wheel.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is not all. We have to model the action of the brake which acts on the rear.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The break decelerates the wheel. Let me put it like that minus capital B

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and this quantity B represents the strength of that braking process.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you put it like this, it acts like a deceleration of the wheel so it's something measured in m/sÂ².

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If it wasn't for the friction force, the wheel would be decelerated by this amount.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now we have reached four equations that describes the process of braking.
