00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,684
In addition to statistically deciding if a sample comes from a new population.

2
00:00:05,684 --> 00:00:09,770
By excepting or rejecting the null. We want to calculate an interval, in which

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,287
the population mean will probably lie. So in this case, we want an interval

4
00:00:14,287 --> 00:00:20,912
that most likely contains the true average rent. For all rental California's

5
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:25,640
units. We'll do essentially the same thing you did in lesson 8. But this time

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,448
using the t statistic since we're using s instead of sigma. Now you've already

7
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:36,400
found the t statistics for 2.5% in each tail. What confidence interval will

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,700
this give us? Fill this in
