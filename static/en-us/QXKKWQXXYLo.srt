00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,220
Changing the visual properties of an element only changes how the element is

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,020
displayed, not what kind of element it is.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,861
You should be sure to choose the right type of element for

4
00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:15,865
certain parts of a page, depending on the what the purpose of that element is.

5
00:00:15,865 --> 00:00:21,220
For example, in this page, the title at the top of

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:27,520
the page is really text giving the user an understanding of what is on the page.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,820
So you should be using a tag that provides such information.

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:38,040
Think of it in terms of a Microsoft Word, Google Doc, or Open Office document.

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,500
When you're typing in a document you might select different headings in order to

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,780
tell the user what part of the document they're reading.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,620
In HTML you can do the exact same thing.

12
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:57,500
Except we call these tags H1 and H2, H3, etc.

13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,250
Search engines also use headings to index the structure and

14
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,680
content of a web page.

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,947
Therefore, you can change the div tag to the more appropriate H1 tag for

16
00:01:07,947 --> 00:01:08,819
our title.

17
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,790
Go ahead and do so and then refresh your browser and tell me what happened.

18
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,780
What did happen to the text, My App?

19
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,950
Did nothing visibly change?

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,600
Or did the the text change in size?

21
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,430
Or did the box around the text change?

22
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,220
Be sure to select any and all that apply.
