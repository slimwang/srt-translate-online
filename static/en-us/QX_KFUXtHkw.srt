1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,720
Series indexes have an interesting
effect on vectorized operations.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,560
When you add two NumPy arrays,

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,240
you're adding up elements of the same
position since there is no index.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,990
Now, for
the series that you've added up so

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,530
far, the positions and
indexes have been the same.

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,110
What do you think happens
if that's not the case?

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,820
And if you were to add based on index
rather than position, what do you think

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,790
would happen if you were to add up two
series that had different indexes?

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:26,940
Try it out and see.

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,470
On the next screen you'll see code to
add a few different Pandas series with

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,810
with different indexes.

12
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,050
Take a look at the results and
see if you can figure out the pattern.

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,040
Once you have a theory about how
vectorized operations work for

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,380
Pandas series, watch the solution
video to see if you are correct.
