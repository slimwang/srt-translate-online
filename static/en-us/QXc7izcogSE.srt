1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is only this outcome,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
with A = -5, B = -5, is an equilibrium point

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
because if A switches, it gets -10.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If B switches, it gets -10.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Neither player wants to switch away from keeping with that strategy.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Over here, the Pareto optimal solution is not an equilibrium point

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
because if B switches, it will do better,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and A will do worse.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is where the game turns out to be a dilemma

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
because there's an equilibrium point that it seems like

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
if both players are rational, they're bound to end up

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
in this outcome,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
whereas the Pareto optimal solution is over here in the other corner.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And yet, being rational, neither Alice nor Bob can see a way

15
00:00:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to get to this preferred outcome.
