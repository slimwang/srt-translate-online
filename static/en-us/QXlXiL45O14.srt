1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,380
Viruses is perhaps the best
known type of malware.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,080
A virus infects a program,
by modifying the program code so

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,530
that when a program runs,
the virus code also runs.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:17,180
It then self-copy into other programs,
and thus, spreads itself.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,350
There are many four stages in
the life cycle of a virus.

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,910
The first is a dormant phase.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,240
This is the phase when a program has
just been infected by a virus but

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,119
program has not run yet so the virus
has not been triggered or spread.

9
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,250
The second stage is propagation.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,790
This is when the malware's
being sent around or spread.

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,880
For example, the malware can
come as an email attachment and

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,070
the email attachment is
being sent to many users.

13
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,420
The third phase is the triggering phase.

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,270
This is when the host
program is being run.

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,730
And as a result,
the virus is also triggered to run.

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,230
For example, when a user clicks an email
attachment that contains a virus,

17
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,960
it's triggering
the virus to run as well.

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,550
The fourth stage is the execution phase.

19
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:09,220
This is when the virus code runs,
performs some malicious activities, and

20
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,270
most importantly, it looks for
targets to infect so that it can spread.

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,805
For example,
in a case of email attachment,

22
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:21,330
when the virus runs it can search for
users in the address book, and

23
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,650
then send email attachment with
the virus to users in the address book.

24
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,340
And that's how he can be propagated,
triggered, executed, and

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,760
again propagated,
triggered, and executed.

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,940
And this is how virus spreads
