00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:00,800
Excellent.

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,260
You've seen the whole Core Data stack,
now.

3
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,150
It may seem like strange advice, but

4
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,040
it's worth taking some time to
memorize the components in that stack.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,900
Being really confident about those
items is really nice in an interview.

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,110
In the next lesson, we're going to
look into a smart architecture

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,260
that'll tie together your Core Data
model, your networking code, and

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:16,940
your user interface.
