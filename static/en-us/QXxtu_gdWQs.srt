1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,240
In the last lesson, you did a bunch
of data analysis using Python.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,689
And you did use NumPy and
matplotlib a bit, but for the most part,

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:11,150
you completed the analysis without
using any additional libraries.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,120
In this lesson, you're going to get
a lot more familiar with NumPy.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,110
And I'll also introduce you
to a library called pandas.

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,290
Both of these libraries,

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,130
especially Pandas take a little
time to learn how to use.

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,640
But once you do, they'll make writing
data analysis code a lot easier.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,590
And your code will also run
faster when you use them.

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,330
When I first started using Pandas,
I spent a lot of time reading online

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,640
documentation, going through tutorials
and I found it really difficult.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,170
This course contains the information
I wish I'd had when I started out.

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,350
I won't be able to cover every feature
that you might want to use, but

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,260
by the end, you'll be better equipped
to read the documentation and

15
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,880
learn more on your own.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,370
In this lesson, I'll be focusing on
using NumPy and Pandas to analyze one

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,910
dimensional data, so something like
a single column of a spreadsheet.

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,560
Let's get started
