00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,368
Because the graph involved estimating, we can't find the exact coordinates of

2
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:08,297
the point of intersection. So, here's another way that we can find it,

3
00:00:08,297 --> 00:00:12,622
substitution. For this method, we solve for one of the variables, and then we

4
00:00:12,622 --> 00:00:17,070
make a substitution for that variable into the other equation. Notice that for

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,289
these two equations, both of them are solved for y. I have y alone on one side

6
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:26,813
of the equation. Notice that both of these y's are the same variable. So, what

7
00:00:26,813 --> 00:00:31,971
we can do is replace this y with what this y is equal to. We're going to take

8
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:37,119
10x plus 10 and move it or substitute it in for y. This is the process of

9
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:42,703
substitution. Now, we have one equation with one variable and we can solve for

10
00:00:42,703 --> 00:00:48,498
this variable. We subtract 7x from both sides to get 3x plus 10 equals 12. Then

11
00:00:48,498 --> 00:00:53,532
we subtract 10 from both sides to get 3x equals 2. And finally, we divide both

12
00:00:53,532 --> 00:00:58,286
sides by three. So 1x is equal to 2 3rds. Remember, x is the variable that

13
00:00:58,286 --> 00:01:03,204
represents how long we're renting the car. So, we rented it for 2 3rds of an

14
00:01:03,204 --> 00:01:07,874
hour. Alright. Here's a throwback to fractions. What's 2 3rds of an hour in

15
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:12,444
minutes? Write your answer here. And don't worry about the unit. I've already

16
00:01:12,444 --> 00:01:13,195
included it.
