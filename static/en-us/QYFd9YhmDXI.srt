1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,511
So what's the issue here
with rolling shutter?

2
00:00:02,511 --> 00:00:04,988
Let's look at the concept
of electronic shutters.

3
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:07,861
Here we're going to talk
about a global shutter

4
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:10,289
which is basically
what's in a CCD sensor.

5
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:13,270
Again, there are no photo sites with
an amplifier reading things are there.

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,527
Everything is first gotten onto the
photo sites and then read off and CCD.

7
00:00:17,527 --> 00:00:20,488
That image is red at
one instant in time.

8
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:22,961
So, if I was to take this camera and
move it this way,

9
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:24,609
as I've shown by this arrow here.

10
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:29,868
What would happen is basically you would
get a full image every time I move it.

11
00:00:29,868 --> 00:00:34,165
So, I basically have three different
images, because what's really happening

12
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:38,103
is, it's really efficient in how it
scans from the top down here as I move.

13
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:42,910
And it basically captures everything
in a global manner completely, so

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,075
nothing is actually moved
as I move the camera.

15
00:00:46,075 --> 00:00:49,489
In contrast to this, let's take what
happens when I have a cellphone.

16
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:54,910
Again, very thin and a very small
sensor and a lens associated with it.

17
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,977
What happens is basically an image
is read one scan line at a time.

18
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:01,437
So now, if I was to take this camera and
move it this way.

19
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:03,791
What's really happening is
the first part got captured.

20
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:08,045
By the time the next scan rate comes in,
the camera is moved a little bit.

21
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:10,139
Similarly, when I move to the third one,
move,

22
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:11,785
the camera is moved a little bit more.

23
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:12,638
So, I keep going.

24
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:16,669
If you notice the camera is moving,
which basically means this straight

25
00:01:16,669 --> 00:01:21,045
line, which would've been down this way,
is now curved or at least slanted.

26
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:23,733
So this whole scene has
been slanted a little bit,

27
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:27,456
because I moved the camera this
way while I was taking the video.

28
00:01:27,456 --> 00:01:31,015
So the global shutter in this case
would have kept line straight,

29
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:34,963
the rolling shutter has created the
small angle that you can see from this

30
00:01:34,963 --> 00:01:36,335
line here from this one.

31
00:01:36,335 --> 00:01:39,028
And that is basically,
I'm moving this in this direction.

32
00:01:39,028 --> 00:01:43,214
This gets much more complicated if I
was to move this in that way, right?

33
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:44,851
And that's why you saw the nonrigidity.

34
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:46,359
because if I had gone this way and

35
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:49,123
come back,
this line would have curved this way.

36
00:01:49,123 --> 00:01:52,321
I'm just showing simple motion,
that's why I'm seeing a slant.

37
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,781
So that's a problem and
partly it is again, as I said,

38
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:59,863
as we go down in the scan in time,
we get a refresh rate like this.

39
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:03,408
The problem with this is we don't
know exactly what it is because it's

40
00:02:03,408 --> 00:02:06,835
proprietary known for each and
every camera by each and every camera

41
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:10,699
manufacturer, we need to figure this
out pretty much from the data itself.
