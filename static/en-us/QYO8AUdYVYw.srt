Wow Chris, that's another really hard order of operations problem. If you got

2
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:10,023
negative 675, you got the answer right. Now, this was a tough problem, and I

3
00:00:10,035 --> 00:00:14,969
even had to use my calculator. Now, let's see how I got negative 675. When I'm

4
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:19,632
looking at this problem, once again, I want to work from the inner parenthesis

5
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:24,211
outwards, following my order of operations. So, the first thing I see is an

6
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:28,300
innermost paretheses of 1 plus 2, so that's the first operation I'm going to

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,269
perform. Again, I want to make sure that I copy down all of the other operations

8
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:38,124
that I have not yet performed. Now that I've performed the operation in the

9
00:00:38,136 --> 00:00:43,179
inner most parentheses, I can do the next level of parentheses which are these

10
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:48,021
brackets. So, I want to do negative 4 times 3, which is negative 12. From here,

11
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:52,838
I see that I have another operation in parentheses which is 4 minus 10. So, I

12
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,968
can evaluate 4 minus 10 which is negative 6. Now that I've performed all the

13
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,138
operations inside parentheses, I can move on to my exponents or my powers. So, I

14
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,331
have three exponents. I have negative 6 squared. Remember when the negative is

15
00:01:08,343 --> 00:01:13,013
inside the parentheses, it's part of the base. So, it's negative 6 times

16
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:18,766
negative 6 which is 36. 3 squared of course is nine, and negative 12 squared is

17
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:24,122
144. Now that I've done all my exponents, I can do my multiplication and

18
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:29,646
division. The only multiplication I have is negative 5 times 144. So, I can

19
00:01:29,658 --> 00:01:35,388
write 36 plus 9, negative 5 times positive 144, I had to get my calculator out

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,384
for this one, is negative 720. Now that I've done all my multiplication and

21
00:01:41,396 --> 00:01:47,580
division, I can do my addition and subtraction in order from left to right. So

22
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:53,207
first thing I have to do is 36 plus 9, which is 45, minus 720. 45 minus 720

23
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:56,167
gives me the negative 675. Great job.
