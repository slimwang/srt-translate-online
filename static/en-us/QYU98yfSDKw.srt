00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:06,017
Okay Google, send a message to Wayne.

2
00:00:06,017 --> 00:00:09,408
I'll be at our building in 20 minutes,
can you get Josh and meet me there?

3
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:16,489
Okay Google, start a run.

4
00:00:25,406 --> 00:00:28,943
[SOUND] Here's the message.

5
00:00:28,943 --> 00:00:33,378
I'll be at our building in 20 minutes,
can you get Josh and meet me there?

6
00:00:33,378 --> 00:00:35,816
>> Reply.

7
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:37,975
How about we make it five minutes?

8
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:39,229
[SOUND]
>> Got it.

9
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:40,087
Here's your message.

10
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:41,783
How about we make it five minutes?

11
00:00:41,783 --> 00:00:42,968
Do you want to send it?

12
00:00:45,382 --> 00:00:47,820
>> Cat videos.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,695
>> [MUSIC]

14
00:00:53,695 --> 00:00:55,065
>> I'll see you in 20 minutes, Timothy.

15
00:00:55,065 --> 00:01:05,351
>> [MUSIC]

16
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:06,883
>> I'll see you in five minutes, Wayne.

17
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,956
>> [LAUGH] Okay.

18
00:01:18,956 --> 00:01:20,930
One, two.

19
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,113
>> Welcome to Ubiquitous Computing.

20
00:01:23,113 --> 00:01:25,900
>> I'm Timothy Jordan,
a Developer Advocate at Google.

21
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,802
>> And I'm Wayne Pakowski,
also a Developer Advocate at Google.

22
00:01:28,802 --> 00:01:32,447
>> And I'm Josh Gordon, and you guessed
it, also a Developer Advocate at Google.

23
00:01:32,447 --> 00:01:34,147
>> As you'll learn in this course,

24
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:38,340
Ubiquitous Computing is simply a fancy
phrase for technology that's accessible

25
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,271
to the user, whenever and
wherever they want or need it.

26
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:43,012
>> Perhaps,
they're outside going for a run.

27
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:45,636
>> Or having some friends over to
watch cat videos and play games.

28
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:47,331
>> Or maybe, it's time for a road trip.

29
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:50,382
>> Your users can be in any of those
situations, and you don't want

30
00:01:50,382 --> 00:01:53,786
them to have to think about what device
they need to get to your service.

31
00:01:53,786 --> 00:01:57,340
>> No, you want an experience that
presents itself to the user wherever it

32
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,058
makes sense.

33
00:01:58,058 --> 00:02:00,758
>> By building an app that runs
on whatever devices they happen

34
00:02:00,758 --> 00:02:01,518
to have nearby.

35
00:02:01,518 --> 00:02:04,997
>> In this course, we'll teach you
about the existing platforms and

36
00:02:04,997 --> 00:02:08,550
tools that can make your app available
on a variety of form factors.

37
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,210
But before we get started, I'll explain
just a little bit more about what

38
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,170
it means for your app to be ubiquitous.
