1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,250
So let's look into a little bit more carefully the scale invariant features that

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,260
we are interested in.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,450
The Harris-Laplacian is one type of scale invariant feature.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,600
Basically, it finds local maximum of Harris corner detection in space and

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,080
Laplacian in scale.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,306
What that basically means is, I have x and y, we've got the translations or

7
00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:19,769
transformations scale.

8
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,577
In essence, if I have something in space here,

9
00:00:22,577 --> 00:00:26,300
this feature could also be measured in different scales.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,238
Laplacians, again, remember all of our work on Laplacian pyramids and

11
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:32,470
Gaussian pyramids that suggests how we could do this kind of stuff.

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,500
So, in essence, we can actually find the feature in different scales.

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,630
Which means that, now, the same feature, if you zoom into an image,

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,120
the feature got bigger, we should be able to detect it with this approach.

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,220
So, in essence, the Harris space is here, and the Laplacian is in scale.

16
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,190
So Harris is x and y, and Laplacian is in scale.

17
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,990
Another scale invariant detector is SIFT, and we'll cover this again in

18
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,350
a lot more detail, but I just want to introduce this very briefly here.

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:04,697
It attempts to find local maximum of difference of Gaussians in space and scale.

20
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:08,215
And the difference of Gaussian is simply a pyramid of differences of

21
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:09,830
Gaussian within each octave.

22
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,505
So this accounts for

23
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:16,620
our idea of different things that are in the frequency domain, and, again,

24
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,640
we're looking for these difference of Gaussians in both space and scale.

25
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,560
Again, looking at our simple example,

26
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,800
our simple schematic here, looking at variations in space.

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,960
But when we go up in scale, we can actually start looking for information.

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,158
The difference of Gaussians, both in x and y, and

29
00:01:34,158 --> 00:01:37,300
also difference in Gaussians in scale.

30
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,510
Again, we'll cover this a little bit more in detail in a later lecture.

31
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,850
So SIFT in essence refers to a scale-invariant feature transform,

32
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,620
which allows us to look for changes in orientation, and

33
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,670
basically allows us to find features within it.

34
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,200
So it allows for

35
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,140
us to compute the best orientation for each keypoint region in an image.

36
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,520
And also captures keypoint description,

37
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,230
where we basically use local image gradients and selected scale, and

38
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,340
also look for rotation to describe each keypoint region.
