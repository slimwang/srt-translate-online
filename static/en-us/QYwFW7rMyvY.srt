00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,470
The specifics, such as the computational power,

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,740
the memory capacity, and the number and

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:12,610
types of input, output of devices, may vary from one manifestation of a computer

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,219
system, to the next. For example, commensurate

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,880
with it's intended use, a cell phone

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,095
or a pda may have very limited

7
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:25,420
input/output capabilities such as a graphics display,

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:31,010
speakers and microphones. But on the other hand, a high end supercomputer

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:36,460
used for running large scale scientific applications may employ thousands

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,550
of CPUs, incorporate several terabytes of memory and be connected

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,560
an array of disks with storage capacities on the order of several parabytes.
