1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,940
Okay, Michael. So this notion of having different features or different

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:10,460
dimensions throw us off has a name and it's called the Curse of Dimensionality.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,970
>> Oh, nice audio effect.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,940
>> I did like that effect in post-production. And

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,320
it refers to well, a very particular thing. So let

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,320
me just read out what it refers to. As

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,370
the number of features or equivalently ,uh, dimensions grows that

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,100
is as we add more and more features we go x of 1, x of two then

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,600
we add x of three, add more and

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,830
more of these features. As those features grows or

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:38,710
as the number of dimensions grow ,the amount of data ,that we

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:44,630
need to generalize accurately also grows exponentially. Now this

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:50,590
is a problem of course because Exponentially means, bad in computer science land

14
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,100
because when things are exponential they're effectively untenable.

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,070
You just, you just, you sort of can't win.

16
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,060
>> I think everybody knows that in the sense that if you look,

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,120
I've done this experiment actually, if you look in the popular press like,

18
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,120
you know, Time Magazine Or New York Times, USA Today. People will use

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,130
the word exponentially sometimes to mean

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,060
exponentially, and sometimes to mean, a lot.

21
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,760
>> Yeah that's actually a pet peeve of mine.

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,750
The whole notion of,

23
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,300
>> Me too.

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,260
>> Oh, it's exponentially bigger. No,

25
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,410
that's, that's not meaningful. If you're

26
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,420
saying I have one point. And then I have another point, and I

27
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,380
want to say this one point is exponentially bigger than this one. That's

28
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,870
meaningless! It's also liberally bigger than

29
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,980
that one. Exponentially refers to a trend.

30
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,420
>> Again, their,their,their not talking about the

31
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,399
mathematical relationship. They just mean a lot.

32
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,760
>> Okay, so they're wrong. And it bothers me deeply but

33
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,320
I'm willing to accept it for the purposes of this discussion. Okay.

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,140
Exponentially means bad. It means that we need more, and more, and more,

35
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,960
and more data as we add features and dimensions. Now as a machine

36
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,380
learning person this is a real problem right, because What you want to do,

37
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,610
or like what your instinct tells you to do is, oh ,we've

38
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,470
got this problem, we've got a bunch of data, we're not sure what's

39
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,870
important. So why don't we just keep adding more and more and more

40
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,850
features. You know, we've got all these sensors and we'll just add this

41
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,380
little bit and this little bit, and we'll keep

42
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,860
track of GPS location and we'll see the time of

43
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,320
the day and we'll just keep adding stuff and then

44
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,720
we'll figure out which ones are important. But the curse

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,770
of dimensionality says that every time you add another one

46
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,410
of these features. You add another dimension, to your input

47
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,020
space, you're going to need exponentially more data, as you add

48
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,940
those features, in order to be able to generalize accurately.

49
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,810
>> Mm.

50
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,090
>> This is a very serious problem, and it sort

51
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,310
of captures, a little bit of what the difficulties are

52
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,030
in kNN. If you have a di, if you have distance function

53
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,950
or a similarity function, that assumes that

54
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,180
everything is Relevant, or equally relevant, or

55
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,110
important, and some of them aren't. You're going to have to see a lot of

56
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,690
data before you can figure that out, sort of before it washes itself away.

57
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,341
>> [CROSSTALK]

58
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:50,520
>> Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

59
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,930
>> Yeah, it seems a little scary. So, you know, I think you

60
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,620
can say these words, and the words sort of make sense, but I think

61
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,740
it helps to kind of draw a picture,

62
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,260
and so I'm going to draw a little picture. Okay?

63
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,180
>> Yeah.

64
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,760
>> All right.
