1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Obviously, the data carries a lot of information.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'll now teach you how to visualize the data,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
using a simple trick called a scatter plot.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
For that, I want you to take a piece of paper and a pen or a pencil

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and arrange the data in a graph where the x axis is the size, and the y axis is the price.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In a scatter plot, each data item becomes a dot.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If we graph different sizes horizontally and prices vertically,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
the very first data item can be graphed as follows.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You draw a line that's vertical at size 1400.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Every house on this dotted like is of the same size--1400.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You draw a horizontal line at the price of $98,000, just below $100,000.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Where these two lines meet you have your very first data point.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This dot corresponds to the very first house in your list of data.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's do the same for the second house.
