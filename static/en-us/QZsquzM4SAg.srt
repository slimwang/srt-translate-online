00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,360
>> All right Michael, so we're back. We have

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,370
learned a bunch of stuff about SVMs and you forced

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,120
me to live up to my promise to connect

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,390
margins. Which is kind of the big cool thing about

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,830
SVMs, the sort of fundamental theoretical construct that's underlying

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,340
SVMs. You forced me to connect that back to boosting.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,730
So I think we've learned everything we need to learn

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,700
about support vector machines for now. What do you think?

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,790
>> If you say so, sounds good.

10
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,790
>> All right.

11
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,340
Well, I will talk to you next time, Michael.

12
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,540
>> Thanks. Bye.
