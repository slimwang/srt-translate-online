Before we attempt our problem, lets review mixed numbers and improper fractions.

2
00:00:04,502 --> 00:00:08,695
Mixed numbers are a way to count objects when we have a couple of objects and a

3
00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:12,890
part of that object. So here I have 2 doughnuts and then I have 2 thirds of one.

4
00:00:12,987 --> 00:00:17,215
I can think about splitting up a whole doughnut into 3 equal pieces, or thirds,

5
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:21,625
and then I'd have 2 thirds. So our entire mixed number would be 2 and 2 thirds.

6
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:25,805
Notice we have a mixture of whole numbers and fractions. That's why we call

7
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:30,120
these mixed numbers. If I split all of my donuts up into thirds, I can count the

8
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:34,240
pieces and I would have 8 thirds, that would be the improper fraction. It's

9
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:38,430
improper because the number in the numerator is higher than the number in the

10
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:43,327
denominator. So, let's see how we can go from the mixed number to the improper

11
00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:48,321
fraction. If I take my whole doughnuts, and split them up into thirds, I would

12
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,452
have six of them. 6 3rds.

13
00:00:49,452 --> 00:00:54,630
I can get that by multiplying 3 times 2. I still have 2 3rds left over. So I

14
00:00:54,642 --> 00:00:59,187
need to add this 2 3rds to my 6 3rds. 6 plus 2 makes 8, so I get 8 3rds.

15
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:04,066
Let's try going the other way. I can think about splitting 8 3rds into 6 3rds

16
00:01:04,078 --> 00:01:09,052
and 2 3rds. Notice that the 6 3rds represents my two whole doughnuts. I know 6

17
00:01:09,064 --> 00:01:14,019
divided by 3 makes 2, and then I have my 2 3rds left over. So 2 and 2 3rds. This

18
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:18,933
also makes sense because I know 3 goes into 8 two full times, and then I would

19
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,487
have a remainder of 2 or 2 3rds left over.
