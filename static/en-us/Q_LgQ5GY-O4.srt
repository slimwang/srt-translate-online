00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,670
To illustrate, an SPD entry
describes a security policy,

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,690
which decides the security parameters
which are stored in an SA in SADB.

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,490
The unique index for
the SA of the receiver is

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,380
the SPI that is encoded
in IP set packet header.
