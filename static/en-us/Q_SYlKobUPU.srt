00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,190
Finally, the last topic we'll cover in this class is AI ethics. Often,

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,310
scientists go about doing science without asking questions about the ethics of

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,350
the science they do. We are also engrossed in questions of funding and proposals

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,630
and papers. However, part of our job as scientists is to ask the question about

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,640
are we doing the right kind of things? There are a large number of

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,080
questions connected with the ethics of AI. We'll post a small number here today.

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,400
There are no easy answers to these questions. So I invite you to discuss these

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,810
questions on the forum? First, AI Ethics put into our economy and our society.

9
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,910
We have talked a lot in this course about designing AI agent that can act and

10
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,470
think and behave like humans. However, in the process,

11
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,520
we quite likely would replace some human jobs with robots. We have talked, for

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,720
example, of robots that can assemble a camera. Does this mean that humans who

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,500
assemble the cameras today will lose their jobs? Of course,

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,790
a counter argument is that new jobs might be created, for example, jobs for

15
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,760
designing robots. Nevertheless, there are hard issues, but ethical implications

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,090
of AI in terms of human economy and society. Second, much of the modern

17
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,550
development of AI is driven by defense applications all across the world.

18
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,680
We already have drones, for example. It is not far-fetched to imagine a future

19
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,380
where there are robot soldiers on the battlefield. What are the implications of

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,310
introducing robot soldiers? Should we build morality into these soldiers?

21
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,660
How do we do so? And if you are to build morality into robot,

22
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,950
what does it teach us about our own morality? A third and related question is,

23
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,140
that if it's hard building human characteristics like creativity and

24
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,770
morality into AI agents, at what point do these agents become like humans?

25
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,060
At what point do we start talking about civil rights for these machines

26
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,440
because they're indistinguishable from humans. The idea has been touched upon in

27
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,720
the popular culture a lot, but it is coming closer and closer to reality.

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,020
What are the criteria under which we'd consider machines to be equal to humans?
