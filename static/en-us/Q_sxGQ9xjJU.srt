Social psychology is an area that many students find endlessly fascinating.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,295
Which isn't surprising, because we're humans. We're social creatures. When

3
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:12,630
we're infants, we need other people to take care of us or we wouldn't survive.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,798
So it comes as no surprise that other individuals actually can influence how we

5
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:20,518
think, feel, and behave. And that's what social psychology is. It's the study

6
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:24,412
of how other people affect our thoughts, behaviors, and feelings, and in fact,

7
00:00:24,412 --> 00:00:28,070
as you're going to see, it's not only the actual presence of other people that

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:34,460
can affect us. It's the perceived presence. So people who aren't even there can

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,072
affect how we think, feel, and behave. Let's go to Susan for more detail about

this lesson.
