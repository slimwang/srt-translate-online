00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,817
I'm going to focus on Interactive 3D rendering in particular. Let's break that

2
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:09,326
phrase down starting from the end. This last word, rendering, means depiction.

3
00:00:09,326 --> 00:00:13,350
Well, it can also mean translating to another language, or turning animals into

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,095
meat, but let's ignore those definitions. An artist can render a scene by

5
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:22,114
painting it, an architect can render a building in perspective. And so on. To

6
00:00:22,114 --> 00:00:26,298
render means to create an image. For the phrase 3D, this means defining things

7
00:00:26,298 --> 00:00:30,401
in a three-dimensional world. In the field of 3D computer graphics, you

8
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:34,840
mathematically define objects, materials, lights, and a camera. And then use

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,781
these together to render onto a 2-dimensional screen. Your monitor becomes a

10
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:42,544
window into this world that you've created. Even newer smart phones have 3D

11
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:46,099
graphic accelerators in them. You've undoubtedly seen video games and special

12
00:00:46,099 --> 00:00:50,470
effects in movies. These are two of the most obvious uses of computer rendering

13
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,733
techniques. There are a vast number of other uses of 3D rendeing that effects

14
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:58,520
how the world works. Architects commonly create 3D graphics presentations for

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,290
their own benefit and for clients. Engineers use rendering to help show

16
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,159
potential problems with their designs. Doctors use 3D reconstructions from

17
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,650
medical scanning devices to understand patients problems. Even lawyers will

18
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,611
employ 3D animations to help explain accidents or other events. Interactive

19
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:18,212
means you can instantly influence what you see on the screen. Video games give

20
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:21,928
us obvious examples. You turn the wheel left in a racing game, and go that

21
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:26,836
direction. Compare this to say, playing a DVD. There's perhaps, some minimal

22
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:31,015
control that could be considered interactive, pause, fast forward and so on. But

23
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:34,200
you're not affecting the world itself in any way. Drawing these lines is

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,875
interactive, I'm affecting what I see, but it's 2-dimensional. By Interactive

25
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:43,035
3D, I mean that the users actions affect something in a 3D virtual world At the

26
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:47,455
least, you move the camera to the world, possibly affecting objects and lighting

27
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:51,338
as you go. This program by James Gow shows MRI data of how the brain is

28
00:01:51,338 --> 00:01:55,958
stimulated when exposed to different objects and actions. On the right is the 2D

29
00:01:55,958 --> 00:02:00,136
system for picking an object, on the left you then see the area stimulated. You

30
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:03,048
can also change the view and with the slider, control how the data is

31
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:07,390
represented. I asked Jack Galiant, who helped with this program, about how much

32
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,102
of the brain is dedicated to processing what out eyes see. The answer is, that

33
00:02:11,102 --> 00:02:15,233
more than a quarter of our brain is involved in interrupting visible signals. I

34
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:19,265
should note that there are other areas of computer graphics having to do with

35
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:22,884
images but are not truly 3D rendering. For example there's a complementary field

36
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:26,816
called image processing. Where you use the computer to analyze photographs or

37
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:31,040
other images and try to extract a mathematical description of the world from

38
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,710
them. Though graphics hardware can definitely accelerate image processing

39
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,019
operations. We'll mostly be focused on 3d rendering in this course.
