Okay. Next part of the quiz. What I'd

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,170
like you to do is implement this function called

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,580
check secure val. Which takes the string h

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,300
and that's of the format you know, s comma

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,020
hash. Which is you know, the output of

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,480
mixed secure val. And verifies that s equals, or,

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,920
or the hash of s equals the hash

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,190
included in, in that response. And otherwise returns none.
