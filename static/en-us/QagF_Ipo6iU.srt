1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,434
Let's look at different equation then. One like this one. Y equals X squared

2
00:00:04,434 --> 00:00:08,887
plus 6x plus three. Now we can't factor this. Know that the only factors of 3

3
00:00:08,887 --> 00:00:13,119
are 3 and 1, and they don't add to equal 6. So we're going to need to come up

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,459
with a different way, a different method, of figuring out where this curve

5
00:00:17,459 --> 00:00:21,580
touches the x axis. I'd like you to write this Right side of the equation in

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,588
completed square form. So, in other words, complete the square on the right

7
00:00:25,588 --> 00:00:29,568
side. However, this time, don't move the 3 over to the left-hand side. Keep it

8
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:33,350
on the right side and just play with the first two terms here to complete the

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,243
square. Once you've completed the square with these two, tack the 3 on to the

10
00:00:37,243 --> 00:00:41,267
end again and simplify. Fill the new expression you have on the right-hand side

11
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:42,035
into this box.
