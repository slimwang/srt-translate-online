1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,680
And what we're going to do,
actually, is do clustering twice.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,140
The first thing we do is,

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,710
we're going to cluster in that big
feature space I was just showing you.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,800
And those clusters are going to
be referred to as textons.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,270
Now this is a word, I think it's a word
that was coined by Bela Julesz who was

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,830
a psychophysicist, guy who did random
autostereograms quite a while ago.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,322
And they were referring to
things like T-junctions and

8
00:00:25,322 --> 00:00:29,705
little end-stops and
other textural descriptors that ex,

9
00:00:29,705 --> 00:00:33,040
existed in,
in images as sort of he saw them.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,320
And the idea is that these clusters
in the feature space would

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,610
be different little textural elements
that were found in these images, right?

12
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,050
And so you would describe
each little window, okay,

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,370
by what's referred to as
its texton histogram.

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,760
That's what this thing is
going to be showing here.

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,790
We'll, we'll take a little
bit more of that.

16
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:01,620
But the idea is that, here there is
just a single value at every pixel,

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,450
which is the single texton that's
tends to be present at that pixel.

18
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,580
That is, which cluster it got mapped to.

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,510
And you can see that, you know, if you
were to just cluster based upon this,

20
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,500
it would be kind of weird because, yeah,

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,900
this is not one nice thing
because it's a single texture.

22
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,580
But the idea here is that,
even though this is a single texture,

23
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,110
there are all these different
little textons that are present.

24
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,710
So instead of segmenting the image based
upon which single cluster you're mapped

25
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,510
to, instead what we're going to do is
we're going to take little windows.

26
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:40,330
So here's a little circular window and
we compute its texton histogram.

27
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:44,930
Okay, so now we've got a whole
bunch of different textons and

28
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,770
this is the count of
the number of those textons.

29
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,670
So I get a histogram at every window.

30
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,540
So here's another window, and
it has kind of a similar histogram.

31
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,570
And here's a third window.

32
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,230
Well, its histogram
looks nothing like that.

33
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,500
And the idea is that you're now
going to cluster in the histogram

34
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,430
space of these textons in order to
be able to get your segmentation.

35
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,160
All right, and how well does that work?

36
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,430
Well, let me show you an example.

37
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,500
So here is a picture of a rhinoceros,
no, a zebra, I guess.

38
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,810
I don't know,
a thing with stripes, okay.

39
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,890
So suppose I cluster
it based upon color.

40
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,370
What would that look like?

41
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,080
Well, it would be a mess.

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,600
Okay?

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,463
And there's your mess, color-based
regions, and you'd say, well,

44
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:30,700
that's a terrible idea.

45
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,600
>> That's a terrible idea
>> So what would be a better idea?

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,110
Well, how about we cluster
based upon texture?

47
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,972
And you can see that you get these
broad clusters that seem to do,

48
00:02:41,972 --> 00:02:43,280
you know, a reasonable job.

49
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,420
I mean, it, it does make the entire,
you know, this region here,

50
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,980
which is sort of this big region there.

51
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,480
You'll notice that it's not, you know,
because of the scales that got used in

52
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,440
this case, it didn't find these legs
here, or, or this one there, but

53
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,450
that's a function of sort of
how you go about describing it.

54
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,940
And I will say that in general,
this is kind of an under-segmented

55
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,650
result that probably should be more
segments, but clearly this is way better

56
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,400
than this color-based approach, because
it allows us to describe the texture.
