00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
A technique called Gibbs sampling,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
named after the physicist Josiah Gibbs,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
takes all the evidence into account and not just the upstream evidence.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It uses a method called Markov Chain Monte Carlo, or MCMC.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The idea is that we resample just one variable at a time

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
conditioned on all the others.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That is, we have a set of variables,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and we initialize them to random variables, keeping the evidence values fixed.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Maybe we have values like this,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and that constitutes one sample, and now, at each iteration through the loop,

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
we select just one non-evidence variable and resample it

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
based on all the other variables.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And that will give us another sample, and repeat that again.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Choose another variable.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Resample that variable and repeat.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We end up walking around in this space of assignments of variables randomly.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now, in rejection and likelihood sampling,

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
each sample was independent of the other samples.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In MCMC, that's not true.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The samples are dependent on each other, and in fact,

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
adjacent samples are very similar.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
They only vary or differ in one place.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
However, the technique is still consistent. We won't show the proof for that.
