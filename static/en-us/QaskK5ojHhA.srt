1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,400
So here's how I started to think about it. So let's say how

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,370
can we represent the idea that we have an uncertain ending. We'll one way

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,560
would be if we had some kind

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,220
of generic probability distributions over the number

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,810
of rounds that the games going to be played. But this seems like an,

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,735
the simplest idea that I could think of. So here, here we have our,

7
00:00:15,735 --> 00:00:18,165
two criminals, and what their going to do is their going to play a

8
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:21,260
round of prisoner's dilemma. But at the end of that round, they're going to

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,220
flip a coin. And with probability one minus gamma, that will be the last

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,480
round, it's all over. But with probability gamma,

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,770
they're actually going to play again. And, and they do

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,409
this after each round. And so each round

13
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,530
is, is basically statistically independent of the other rounds.

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:36,860
>> I see.

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,510
>> So the set up here is, with probability gamma,

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,410
the game continues. Now, notice that I chose gamma here.

17
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,550
This was a, it's representing a probability here, but in

18
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,810
the past, we've used this to represent a discount factor.

19
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,063
>> Mm-hm.

20
00:00:48,063 --> 00:00:51,000
>> But that actually is the same thing, right?

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,040
In, in, in the normal discounting, we say that the

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,760
value that you get one step from now, is discounted

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,950
downward by gamma. And that's exactly what you'd take if

24
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,550
you worked out the expected value of a game where you

25
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,180
continued making steps with probability gamma. And with probability one

26
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,460
minus gamma, it ends if you get zero from then

27
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,250
until the rest of time. So every round here could

28
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,090
be your last, or not, right? It could be that you

29
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,830
actually get to continue playing. Does that make some sense?

30
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,200
>> That makes perfect sense.

31
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,760
>> Awesome. All right, so, so yeah, this is,

32
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,610
this is exactly that kind of situation where, well,

33
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,390
here, let me, let me ask you a question.

34
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,800
What's the expected number of rounds of this game?

35
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
>> Well, I'll bet it's finite if gamma's

36
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,080
less than one Yes, I even wrote that down.

37
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,890
>> Yeah, I'm smart. Or at least I can read.

38
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,250
>> Sure, but what's the, but, specifically we could actually write

39
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,050
it as a, as a, function of gamma.

40
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,150
>> Let's see. If gamma were something like, 99% then

41
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,510
I would expect it to be about a 100, right?

42
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,070
>> I think that's right.

43
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,670
>> Yeah.

44
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,540
>> So is that, is that your answer? [LAUGH] My function

45
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,930
of gamma is if gamma is .99 the answer is 100.

46
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,490
>> Yeah, something like that. It's not a total function but it's a function.

47
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,550
>> Well, it's a sample. I mean, you

48
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,280
do machine learning. Why don't you tell me what

49
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,780
the function would be given that sample.

50
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,880
>> Well, we can make it a quiz or I could just tell you.

51
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,700
>> Why don't you just tell me.

52
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,390
>> Alright. So one over one minus gamma

53
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,050
is the answer. It works for your example.

54
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:17,820
>> Um-hm.

55
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,110
>> 1 minus .99 is 100th and we're talking 1 over that so,

56
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,630
you get a 100. And, yea we could go through the argument as to

57
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,111
why that's that's what it is. But this one over one minus gamma

58
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:31,306
is what shows up all the time. If gamma is zero, then we're talking

59
00:02:31,306 --> 00:02:34,290
about one over one. The game lasts one round. That's exactly what we'd expect.

60
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,860
>> Mm-hm As gamma gets closer and closer to one

61
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,190
this pro, this quantities getting closer and closer to infinity. So,

62
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,360
>> Right.

63
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,730
>> in fact if you know, it becomes unbounded as gamma hits one. So

64
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,620
yeah. So this is the expected of rounds, and so that means like yeah.

65
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,110
So as you said if gamma is 0.99, it's a 100 rounds. And we

66
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:56,740
already, reasoned that at a 100 rounds the whole thing falls apart. Right, huh,

67
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,760
and I noticed the one over one minus gamma, of course, is just like

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,890
the way we did discount factors, when we started doing MVP's in the first place.

69
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,730
>> Exactly, yeah, that, that kind of links them together.

70
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,410
>> Hm, that's actually kind of neat.
