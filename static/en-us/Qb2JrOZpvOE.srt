1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,590
Let's start by reading the first error.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,850
It says on Line 1, the Tag Text,
is not a supported opening tag.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,270
So if we look at the line numbers,
line 1 corresponds to this one.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,540
And indeed we see that the view
name should be TextView

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,785
without a space there, and
it should be camel case as well.

6
00:00:20,785 --> 00:00:25,035
So, the capitalization is correct, but
we need to get rid of the space, so

7
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:29,320
now it recognizes that TextView
is what we're talking about.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,490
That reduces one error.

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,710
Cool.
So, now, three more to go.

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,570
The next error says that the tag
TextView should be self-closing.

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,800
This means it should end with a forward
slash and closing angle bracket.

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,880
So, if we check the code, there should
be a self-closing TextView tag, but

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,190
we only see the closing angle bracket.

14
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:55,481
It's missing the [NOISE] so
we add that in.

15
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:56,119
There you go.

16
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:58,940
And now we're down to two errors.

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,610
Cool.
So the next one says,

18
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,890
The attribute androidlayout_height
does not support the value 150,

19
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,710
which is on line 4.

20
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:12,230
So we go to line 4, and
then we see that this code is incorrect.

21
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,120
We may not know what's wrong with it,
though, so we can compare it

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,670
to the layout width line above since
width and height are pretty similar.

23
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,800
Here we set the width to be 150dp.

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,250
We remember dp from our
earlier discussion of it.

25
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,875
And indeed we're missing dp for
the height, so let's add dp.

26
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,610
Woo-hoo, and
now we're down to one error.

27
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,310
And the last error says,

28
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,670
The color @android:color/darker_groy
is not supported.

29
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,810
Did you type it incorrectly?

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,220
In my mind, darker groy is not a color,
but darker gray is, so that is a typo.

31
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,500
So I'm going to erase the O,
type an A, and

32
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,340
yay, our device now updates to
show a preview of the TextView.

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,250
Oh, there's one more thing.

34
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,670
This Happy Birthday text is
actually spelled incorrectly,

35
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,390
but there are no errors for
that misspelling.

36
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,600
That's because the text for TextView can
be anything inside these two quotes.

37
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,510
So you can misspell anything that you
want or you can spell it correctly.

38
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,170
It really doesn't matter and
it will just show up like that.

39
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,940
When you're creating your app,
we're not checking for

40
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,110
the rules of English, we're checking for
the rules of XML Syntax.
