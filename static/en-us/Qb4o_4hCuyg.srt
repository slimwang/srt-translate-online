1
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,280
Tell me about a time when I failed and
how did I deal with the situation.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,120
So the time that immediately
comes to mind was

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,270
at one time I'd built this
application called Wow Census.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,020
It was an application that gathered
up in-game demographic data for

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,845
the game World of Warcraft.

6
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:25,678
Hugely popular and
I severely underestimated the amount of

7
00:00:25,678 --> 00:00:28,971
data that the users would be sending me.

8
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:32,692
Not only did I program
the parsers completely wrong,

9
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:37,170
I used the wrong language,
I was parsing the files very poorly.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,338
I wasn't thinking about how that
would impact the server and

11
00:00:44,338 --> 00:00:47,887
very quickly,
killed my shared hosting provider.

12
00:00:47,887 --> 00:00:51,161
Had to go buy a dedicated server.

13
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:54,087
And that's pretty much how I
got through it was, I went and

14
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:57,130
found a friend that knew
more about this than I did.

15
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,070
And I could go to him and
I could say, listen I messed up.

16
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,319
Here's the problems I'm having,
I believe this is the solution.

17
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,770
And bounce that solution off of him.

18
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,710
And he did say, yeah that's what you
need to do here I hope you with it and

19
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,580
I can learn from him.

20
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,120
He was a system administrator so

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,560
he basically did the, helped me get
the dedicated server up and running.

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,640
And beyond that I would just
turn to programming friends and

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,580
say listen, I'm trying to parse
these files you know these files

24
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,350
are 300 megs large, thousands of lines.

25
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,800
But I'm only interested in
100 lines out of each one,

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,570
so how do you think is
the best situation handle it?

27
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,600
And so really leaning on that
support network around me.

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,830
And just learning as much
as I could from them.

29
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,120
Was really helped me get through that
and turned it into a successful product.

30
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:45,820
Thanks.
