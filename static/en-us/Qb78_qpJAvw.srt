00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,170
Now, there's actually another property of sound that we haven't talked about.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:07,893
And that property is called timbre. So, let me give you an example of this. I'm

3
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:10,420
going to play a couple of sounds for you. So, first little to this.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,048
[SOUND].

5
00:00:11,048 --> 00:00:13,314
And now, listen to this. [SOUND].

6
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:14,672
Could you tell the difference?

7
00:00:14,672 --> 00:00:17,095
>> Yeah, One was a guitar and one was a piano.

8
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:19,999
>> Now, there's interesting that you could distinguish because they both had the

9
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:24,904
exact same pitch. And they had the same volume. So, this difference between the

10
00:00:24,904 --> 00:00:26,450
sounds is what's called timbre.

11
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,508
>> So, this is basically the difference in the quality of the sound.

12
00:00:29,508 --> 00:00:32,740
>> Yeah, you could think of it like that. Which sort of leads to the next

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,445
question.

14
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:36,670
>> Is that what property the sound wave makes as perceived timbre?

15
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,935
>> Right. And it's the wave's complexity.

16
00:00:39,935 --> 00:00:43,406
>> That's the property of the sound wave that lets us perceive timbre. And what I

17
00:00:43,406 --> 00:00:47,140
mean by that is like this like this, this is what we would call a pure wave.

18
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:47,730
[SOUND].

19
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,799
But some waves are complex, like this one.

20
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:51,384
[SOUND].

21
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:56,354
And it's this complexity that allows us to perceive a wave's timbre.

22
00:00:56,354 --> 00:00:58,914
>> Okay, I think this makes sense, but it's a lot of information, let me make sure

23
00:00:58,914 --> 00:01:00,154
I understand.
