00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,964
Did you get those three slopes right? If you did, great job. For the first

2
00:00:03,964 --> 00:00:09,818
equation, we have y equals 3x plus 9. This equation is in slope-intercept form.

3
00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:14,669
For slope-intercept form, we know the equation is y equals mx plus b, where b

4
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:20,202
is the y intercept and m is the slope. So, we know if the equation is in

5
00:00:20,202 --> 00:00:24,300
slope-intercept form. The coefficient to the x variable is going to be the

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,716
slope. So in this case, the slope is equal to 3. The second equation is written

7
00:00:30,716 --> 00:00:35,346
in standard form, 3x plus 2y equals 7. I find, putting the equation in slope

8
00:00:35,346 --> 00:00:38,706
intercept form the easiest way to find the slope of an equation that is in

9
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:44,664
standard form. It just takes two simple steps. The first step is to subtract 3x

10
00:00:44,664 --> 00:00:51,319
from both sides. When I subtract 3x from both sides, I get 2y equals negative

11
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:56,423
3x plus 7. I'm almost in slope intercept form but I have 2y instead of y

12
00:00:56,423 --> 00:01:03,188
equals. So I have to divide everything through by 2. When I divide everything

13
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:09,068
through by 2, I get y equals negative 3 over 2 is negative 3 halves x, plus 7

14
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:15,304
halves. So once again, this equation is in slope-intercept form, so we know the

15
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:21,450
coefficient of the x variable, which is negative 3 halves, is the slope. So the

16
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,610
slope is negative 3 halves. The third practice problem was just a little bit

17
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:31,155
trickier. To get this equation in slope intercept form, I subtract 6x from both

18
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:38,065
sides and I get negative 3y is equal to negative 6x plus 12. Now, here's where

19
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:41,818
I have to be careful. I have to divide the whole equation through by negative

20
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:46,100
3. This can be a little confusing, but let's just take it one step at a time.

21
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,890
On the left side of the equation, I have negative 3 over negative 3, which of

22
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,998
course is 1. So that just leaves me with y. When I divide negative 6x by

23
00:01:53,998 --> 00:02:00,576
negative 3, negative 6 divided by negative 3 is 2x. And then, I have 12 divided

24
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,318
by negative 3. 12 divided by negative 3 is negative 4. So now we have the

25
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:10,410
equation and slope intercept form, and the slope is going to be the coefficient

26
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:16,170
of the x variable, which is 2. If you got these answers correct, great job. If

27
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,270
not, you might want to go back and review the videos on how to find slope from

28
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,420
the equation of a line.
