1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,280
So our purpose here is
to now start seeing is,

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,180
can we actually find this red box?

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,920
Can we actually find a crop
of the original image and

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,105
just keep that red box inside
the scope of this entire image?

5
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:14,795
So here you see the red box move.

6
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:17,165
And basically,
it's a cropped version of the original.

7
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:19,715
This one is the result,
this is the original video.

8
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:23,393
And what we basically want to do
is find the best possible red box.

9
00:00:23,393 --> 00:00:27,345
But we want to keep this red box cropped
so that I don't have to look for

10
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:28,153
pixels outside.

11
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,145
I don't want to look for
those black borders, and

12
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:32,064
I don't want to be able
to fill in the holes.

13
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:35,255
So our solution is basically
constrain the crop

14
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:38,020
window to stay within the frame bounds.

15
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,220
And also, this allows us to guarantee
that basically we never go into

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,270
an undefined content.

17
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,908
You don't go outside the borders, and
therefore, we don't have to do things

18
00:00:46,908 --> 00:00:50,328
like in-painting, that is figuring out
how to do the pixel and color them

19
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:53,496
pixels around to be able to make
sure that there is no black regions.

20
00:00:53,496 --> 00:00:56,664
Remember, this is the kind of stuff we
looked at when we were doing filtering,

21
00:00:56,664 --> 00:00:59,370
where we had to flip images and
start doing simple stuff.

22
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,770
But, of course, in a video like this,
we would have to do a lot more,

23
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,520
and technique usually used for

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,860
that is in-painting and
actually does always create artifacts.
