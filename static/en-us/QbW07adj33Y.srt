00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,640
Two-way relationships.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,795
Gosh!

3
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:05,913
That was worse than the last one.

4
00:00:09,696 --> 00:00:11,494
Remember, data storage is cheap.

5
00:00:11,494 --> 00:00:15,851
The user's time is not.

6
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:25,299
What else could go wrong?

7
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:26,496
What else could go wrong?

8
00:00:26,496 --> 00:00:28,675
What else could go wrong.

00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:33,419
[MUSIC]

10
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:35,856
>> Corporate mandated
work time is now over.

11
00:00:35,856 --> 00:00:41,310
Lunch time for
sectors 113, 114, and 115.

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,994
Please enjoy your lunch.

13
00:00:47,668 --> 00:00:51,612
>> [SOUND] There's a protein
clump in my instarito.

14
00:00:51,612 --> 00:00:53,808
I really can't eat this.

15
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:57,222
>> 9443, Walter, you have to keep up
your strength if you're going to keep

16
00:00:57,222 --> 00:00:58,800
filing these tax returns.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,065
You remember what happened to 1253?

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,360
>> Her name was.

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,056
But really, I wish our corporate
overlords Grocery Grabber LLC would

20
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:10,215
pay more attention to food quality.

21
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:13,609
You'd think they would, considering
they started as a food company.

22
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:16,050
I wonder what Shopping List++-
>> Quiet.

23
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,853
You must not speak the forbidden name.

24
00:01:18,853 --> 00:01:22,403
9443, Walter, I know times are hard.

25
00:01:22,403 --> 00:01:24,385
Sometimes I wish I could talk to JP.

26
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:27,944
But I haven't seen him since
he joined the resistance.

27
00:01:27,944 --> 00:01:37,944
[MUSIC]

28
00:01:41,988 --> 00:01:43,740
JP, what happened to you?

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,740
>> I've suffered a terrible injury
at the hands of the robot army that

30
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,180
controls our every move,
but it was worth it.

31
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,730
Do you remember back in the days when
Grocery Grabber was just a small company

32
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,590
competing with Shopping List++ instead
of the evil megacorporation that

33
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,020
runs our very lives?

34
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,110
>> Yes, and we shan't forget.

35
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,681
>> Well, back then, the evil programmers
at Grocery Grabber had discovered

36
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:08,750
a little-known rule in Firebase.

37
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:14,710
[COUGH] This rule could be added to
a Firebase security and rules document.

38
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,800
With this very rule, they could read
data more efficiently and faster.

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,950
Hundreds and
hundreds of thousands of lines of data.

40
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,410
It allowed them to eventually take over.

41
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,456
Here, let me pull up
an astral computer screen.

00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,956
