1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,450
In the previous lesson you wrote
your very first unit test.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,750
Congratulations.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,420
If you recall,
your test looked something like this.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,400
You were calling an expect function and

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,740
then chaining a matcher
like to be on to the end.

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,530
In this lesson, you'll be writing tests
against a variety of synchronous and

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,280
asynchronous functionality.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,770
You'll predict and write the code
required to pass these tests and

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,560
confirm the suite of tests pass.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,190
Unfortunately JavaScript
doesn't have these testing

11
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,200
functions defined by default, so

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,509
we'll need to use a library that will
provide this functionality for us.

13
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,590
There are a few different
testing libraries available.

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,170
But in this course we'll be
using one called Jasmine.

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,130
It's a popular and

16
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,150
easy to use library in use at companies
like Pivotal Labs and Helpful.

17
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,180
For this course, you'll want to
use the 2.2 branch of Jasmine.

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,856
I've included all of the sample code and

19
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:51,110
Jasmine 2.2 and
a get help repository for you.

20
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,600
You'll find the link in
the instructor notes below.

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,060
Go ahead and clone that repository and
let's get started.
