1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,880
Alright, so how are we going to figure this out?

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,750
>> By you letting them figure it out while I figure it out.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,860
>> [LAUGH]

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,810
I think you should figure this out.

5
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,220
>> Okay let's figure it out.

6
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,450
>> It might not be obvious just looking at it blankly so why don't

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,129
we just throw in some values here. So, for example we can do this.

8
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,535
>> Mm-hm

9
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:18,930
>> Which is, it gets filled in

10
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,390
in both places. So the probability that thunder

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,670
is true given that lightning is false and storm is true, what is that number?

12
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,550
>> Well,

13
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,350
so we just have to find the place in our

14
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,150
little eight-row table where lightning is false and storm is true.

15
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,460
>> Lightning is false and storm is true, uh-huh.

16
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,540
>> Which is there.

17
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,601
>> Uh-huh.

18
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:41,410
>> And the probability that thunder is true is 0.04 divided by

19
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,760
0.4. Oh cause we're asking about thunder right. Was what's the probability that

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,650
thunder is true given that the other two things lightning is false and

21
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,410
storm is true so that's going to be divided by the point 4.

22
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,520
That's the setting that we're in.

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,460
>> Right and Point 04 divided by point 4 is point 1

24
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,830
>> Right so maybe we'll get lucky and it will work out the same

25
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,790
with the other one. So where do we have to look for that one?

26
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,230
>> Well now we have to look in the

27
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,860
row where lightning has false and storm is false.

28
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,090
>> Okay. Down here.

29
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,990
>> And look at the case where thunder is true,

30
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,003
and that's .03. .03 divided by .3 which is also .1.

31
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:16,820
>> Woo hoo! So that works as an answer. It turns out that, in fact,

32
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,300
no matter what you type into these two boxes, it

33
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,860
does, in fact, work. And what does that tell us?

34
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,750
>> Well, it tells us that it doesn't

35
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,710
matter what the value of storm is. We can

36
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,630
figure out the value of thunder by only looking

37
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,380
at the value of lightening. So, that is to

38
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,000
say, that the probability of thunder given lightning

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,160
and storm is equal to the probability of thunder

40
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,660
given lightening or that we have conditionally independent variables.

41
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,090
Yes, that's right. Storm is conditionally independent of thunder,

42
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:42,630
given lightning.

43
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,375
>> Right. So, the probability of thunder giving

44
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,130
li-, given lightning and storm, is equal to

45
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,760
the probability of thunder, given lightning. That means

46
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,930
that thunder and storm are conditionally independent, given lightning.

47
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,150
>> Or thunders conditionally independent of storm, given lightning.

48
00:01:59,150 --> 00:01:59,720
>> Sure.

49
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,590
>> Very good. Alright. So now what we're going to

50
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,500
do next is say, Okay well given that we

51
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,630
have this nice property. And yeah, I, I worked

52
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,780
a little bit to make sure that the numbers,

53
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,530
worked out. It doesn't always happen this way,

54
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,560
but here we had some nice conditional independence and

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,000
what, we're going to do next is look

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,560
at a nice representation of that, kind of information.
