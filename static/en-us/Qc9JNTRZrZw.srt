1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,339
I'm going to convert this equation into slope-intercept form. So first I'm going

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,764
to add 2x to both sides, because I want to isolate y. I get negative 3y equals 6

3
00:00:10,764 --> 00:00:15,747
plus 2x and I can rewrite this side by switching the terms around. Then I

4
00:00:15,747 --> 00:00:21,129
divivde each term by negative 3 to get 1y is equal to negative 2 3rds x minus 2.

5
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:25,293
Notice, I have one negative sign here, and one negative sign here, so both of

6
00:00:25,293 --> 00:00:29,574
these terms need to be negative. Alright, now, I'm ready to graph. I know my y

7
00:00:29,574 --> 00:00:33,741
intercept is at negative 2, so I go two units down on the y-axis. I know my

8
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:37,969
slope is negative 2 3rd. I'm going to put the negative sign with the 2, which

9
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:42,311
means I move down two units and right three units. If I move down two units and

10
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:46,422
right three units, I end up here, at this point. This wasn't one of the boxes

11
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:50,620
down here, so these are out. We could continue moving two units down and three

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,830
units right to get other points down in this region. So, I have two points and I

13
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,192
know my line should like this. But how do I get the other points up here? Well,

14
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:03,680
I assign the negative to the 2. What if I put the negative instead with a 3? In

15
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,889
this case, the 2 would be positive and I would move up two, and the 3 would be

16
00:01:07,889 --> 00:01:12,343
negative, and I would move left three. If I start from my y-intercept and move

17
00:01:12,343 --> 00:01:16,567
two units up and three units left, I end up at this point here. When working

18
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:21,187
with slope, the positive and negative signs always indicate the directions we

19
00:01:21,187 --> 00:01:25,987
need to move. Two points determine line and the third one is like our insurance,

20
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:30,415
so if I connect these, I should get a line. So here is the line that represents

21
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:32,433
our linear equation, pretty cool.
