00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,510
In this class you have built your own framework and also used an existing one.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,240
But when you enter the workforce and

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,260
work on projects, how do you know when to use which?

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,420
It's a common problem that you're going to be faced with.

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,900
So, let's see if Jacques has any advice for us.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,477
>> Hey so there's actually a bit of a trade off in between using

7
00:00:20,477 --> 00:00:25,170
an established framework like Bootstrap or using your own framework.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,230
And when you use a framework like Bootstrap,

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,180
you're going to get a lot of features.

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,100
I mean, as you can see, you know, as you've worked through so

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,450
far, you can build a tremendous amount with Bootstrap.

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,060
When you start to need to do things outside of that framework,

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,140
when you want to start doing things that Bootstrap doesn't,

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,080
support, you might look at making your own.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,890
And when you make your own you get a lot of freedom.

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,900
You, you can do anything really.

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,240
But you're going to have to put in the work to do it.

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,350
So as you approach your projects try and

19
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,880
see what that, how that breaks down for you.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,970
If you're going to need to do a lot of things that bootstrap doesn't support,

21
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,860
try looking at maybe rolling your own.

22
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,120
If you're going to be doing things that Bootstrap does or that another

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,830
framework does that you find that you really like, go for that, absolutely.

24
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,700
At Udacity we actually use a combination between Bootstrap and

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,930
some stuff that we've written ourselves, to work, along side of it.

26
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,870
And that's pretty much it.

27
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,410
Congratulations on, you know, getting through, the class so far.

28
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,750
And you know, it'd be fantastic to see you working on your own projects,

29
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,495
or in you know, at some point a professional office like this.

30
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:43,284
