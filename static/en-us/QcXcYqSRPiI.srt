1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,060
Let's explore how to do this in Altrix.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,610
We're starting with daily sales data,
that runs from January 1,

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,410
2015 to December 31, 2015, and

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:14,150
we want to aggregate the sales value for
each month.

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,580
When we look at the data,

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,750
we can see that the date field is in
a date format not a string format.

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,100
This is important to recognize, because
if we want to aggregate by month,

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,650
then we need to create a new
field that has the month in it,.

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,010
Then we simply use the values in that
new field, to group the data by.

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,380
We can easily create a month
field by using the formula tool.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,750
Make sure to change
the type to a string.

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,287
Go down to the functions,
choose Date/Time, and

13
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:46,920
we'll use the Date/Time format function.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,087
If we browse through the help,
going to the Functions &gt; Date/Time,

15
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:58,105
we can find information
around that Date/Time format,

16
00:00:58,105 --> 00:01:02,388
and find the format string
that we need to pull out

17
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:06,491
the three character
month value which is %b.

18
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:09,768
So going back to the workflow,

19
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:14,430
where it says dt we put
in the field date, and

20
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,250
where it says f we replace
this with "%b" in quotes.

21
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,800
We can see the month value
appearing in this field.

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,030
Then we can add the summarize
tool to aggregate the data

23
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,809
to the new month field, and
sum up the sales values.

24
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,520
However, when we run this, we see that
the data is sorted by month name, so

25
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,180
the months don't appear
in their calendar order.

26
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,510
To fix this,
we'll go back to the formula tool and

27
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,660
add one more month field,
that represents the month as a number.

28
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,120
We'll use the same function again, but

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,270
this time we'll use % lower case
m to pull out the month number.

30
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,610
When we add this to
our summarize tool and

31
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:03,190
move it to the top, the data will now
be sorted in calendar month format.
