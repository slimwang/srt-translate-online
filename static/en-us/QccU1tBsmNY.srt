00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,000
Before we dive into more
content let's take a step back.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,890
Here's what you can expect to
learn in the upcoming lessons.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,550
In the first lesson we'll start by
covering how you can generate ideas and

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,410
evaluate them against each other.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,920
Then you'll learn techniques for
validating your ideas so

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,530
you know you're working on a product
that has a place in the market.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,310
In lesson two, you'll learn about high
level concerns for user experience and

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,660
user interaction.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,280
Now you won't be a professional
user experience designer by the end

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,290
of the lesson.

11
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,930
Instead, you'll have a strong sense
of the big questions you'd answer

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,630
about user experience.

13
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,080
And you also identify common
design elements in products.

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,340
With a validated idea from lesson one,
and

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,940
the knowledge of user
experience in lesson two,

16
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,050
you'll start to build mock-ups of your
app, or website through a design spread.

17
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,510
You'll learn how start ups get real
feedback from users in just a few days.

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,120
This is the same methodology
that Google Venture uses

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,220
with startups such as Nest and
Blue Bottle Coffee.

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,160
Finally, in lesson four,
you'll learn about metrics, so

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,170
you can figure out how to improve
the product and grow the business.

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,830
Along the way, you'll be completing
tasks related to the final project.

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,730
In the end, you will have gone through
the effort of generating, researching,

24
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,890
validating, and testing a mock
up of your product with users.
