1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,430
Let's develop your intuition
a little bit more.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,640
We'll use this hypothetical dag.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,050
Now suppose the dag has work W(n) and
span D(n).

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,870
The ratio of work to span or w divided
by d has a special interpretation.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,680
It basically measures the amount
of work per critical path vertex.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,770
So, think about that for a second.

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,930
At every critical path vertex,
there's an average amount of work.

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,130
So this ratio basically tells you
the average available parallelism

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,619
in the dag.

10
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,790
So imagine you're a critical
path vertex like this one.

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,950
When that critical path vertex executes,
there's going to be a bunch of work

12
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,720
sitting around and on average, the
amount of such work is W divided by D.

13
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,810
So what does that imply?

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,970
Suppose I give you a PRAM
with P processors.

15
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,330
How many processors should you use?

16
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,500
It looks like it would be nice to
have about w over d processors.

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,450
And if that's the case you can basically
keep the processors busy on average.

18
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,900
Work and
span give us some more information.

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,140
You know for example that the span is
a lower bound on the execution time.

20
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,920
We are going to give
this a special name,

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,880
we are going to call it the Span Law,
punishable by death.

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,380
Now that's a lowerbound in terms of the
span but it's not the only lowerbound.

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,380
Another scenario I could imagine
is taking all of the work, and

24
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,640
if there is no critical path,

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,464
then I would just divide that work
evenly among the p processors.

26
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:30,740
And that would give me
another lower bound.

27
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,880
Basically the ceiling of W divided P.

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,870
And we'll give than
an ominous name as well.

29
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,810
The work law.

30
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,100
Now I have a pea-sized brain.

31
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,610
I don't like remembering all these laws,
so

32
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,780
I'm going to write this more compactly.

33
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,100
Both laws hold, so I can combine them.

34
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,948
Basically the two laws have to be true
simultaneously so I can combine them.

35
00:01:50,948 --> 00:01:58,290
So remember, W/D tells you the average
available parallelism, and W and D

36
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,500
together given P gives you a lower bound
which is this combined work span law.

37
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,440
Commit these to memory.
