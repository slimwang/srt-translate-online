1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,490
Let's take a quiz.

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:05,150
For this quiz, I want you to
imagine a distributed file system

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,670
where the file sharing is implemented
via a server-driven mechanism and

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,680
with session-semantics.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,850
Given this design,
which of the following items should be

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,180
part of the per file data structures
that are maintained by the server?

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:25,940
The options are: readers, current
writer, current writers, version number.

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,000
You should check all that apply.
