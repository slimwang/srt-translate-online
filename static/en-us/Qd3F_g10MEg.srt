00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So as usual, we're going to make an inventory of concepts in the game.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This time I'm going to try to break things out a little bit,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and I'm going to talk about low-level concepts,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
high-level concepts, and mid-level concepts.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
As we saw in the discussion forums

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
there's always a question of where do you want to start.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Do you want to describe the low level first and build up from there?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Do you want to describe the high level first and build down?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I think for this case we'll take more of a middle out approach.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So, at the mid level there's the concept of current state of the game.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We're sort of inching towards a search problem,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and we know that we have to represent states for a search problem.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So, we want to know the current state of the game.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If we're thinking of search problems

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
then we also have to know about actions we can take.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We know that there are two actions: Roll and hold.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So, here's some candidates for what's in the current state.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
First, the things that were on the scoreboard.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The scoreboard, remember, had three things.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Then the player whose turn it is, we might want that to be part of the state.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The previous role of the dice, whether I just rolled a five or something else,

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
that might be part of the state.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The previous turn score, how much did the other player just make on their turn?

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So, all of these are possibilities.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You might be able to think of other possibilities.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I want you to tell me which one of these are necessary to describe the state of the game.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I guess I should say here that we're assuming that the goal of the game,

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
the number of points you need win, we're assuming that's constant

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and doesn't need to be represented in each individual state.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We just represent it once for the whole game.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Which of these are necessary for the current state?
