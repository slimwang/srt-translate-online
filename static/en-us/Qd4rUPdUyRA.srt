00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,150
The third way of estimating company
value is simply to let the market

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,440
decide.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,530
And that's called Market Capitalization.

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,460
This is a simple calculation,
Market Capitalization

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,650
is just equal to the number of shares
that are outstanding times the price.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,160
So, in other words,
you can look at the stock market and

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,670
see what the current price is and
see how many shares are owned by people.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,580
And it's just one times the other and

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,750
that's the value of the company in
terms of market capitalization.
