1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Oh, hey. We're back. Welcome.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Excuse me a sec. I was just sketching out a business plan on the back of this napkin.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So I have an idea, then question mark, then profit.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But you know, this just doesn't work so well.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
These napkins are so porous the markers don't work on them.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I think I'm going to throw away this cliche and move to a different cliche:

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the back of the envelope.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Much easier to write on the back of the envelope, and it's a really valuable skill.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's a valuable skill in real life to be able to do quick and dirty calculations,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and it's especially useful for computer programmers.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It allows computer programmers to have the important virtue of being lazy.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You don't normally think of lazy as being a virtue, but it is.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It allows us to say we're going to come up with the simplest design we can,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
validate on the back of an envelope that that design is efficient enough

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
for what we're trying to do, and then we can stop.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We don't have to try to make it more complex.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This whole class is about managing complexity,

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and one of the most important ways to manage complexity is to leave it out completely,

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
just go for the simple solution.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
If we can do that, then we're well on our way to better designs.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
In this class we'll learn how to do that,

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
we'll learn how to do the calculations of when you're efficient enough,

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
we'll learn when to stop, and we'll learn how to make programs more efficient.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to start with a well-known puzzle called the Zebra Puzzle.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Here's a description of it.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We're going to try to address this puzzle, see if we can come up with a program to solve it,

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and explore the methodology for how we come up with that solution

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and the process of deciding what's a good enough solution

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and whether a brute force solution will work.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You can read the description of the puzzle here.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Now let's start to analyze it.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We'll begin with an inventory of the concepts in the puzzle

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
just to make sure that we understand what's going on.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The first concept is houses.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We're told there's 5 of them.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And then there's properties of the inhabitants of these houses and of the houses themselves.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So there's nationality, colors of the houses, the pets that they own,

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
the drinks that they drink, and the smokes that they smoke.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And then in addition to properties, there's a notion of assignment of properties to houses.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And you can think of that either way.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You can think of it as assigning house number 2 the color red

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
or think of it as assigning red to house number 2.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Then there's a notion of locations,

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
the locations 1 through 5 that mention the idea of the first house

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and the middle house and of the next to relation and of the immediately to the right relation.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And I think that covers most of what was in the specification.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's go back to it and see if it works.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So I'm seeing lots of concepts that we've already covered:

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
5 houses, Englishman, red house, Spaniard, dog.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
There's a few words that we haven't covered,

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
things like lives in and owns the.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We covered them in a generic sense of saying it's an assignment of Englishman to a house

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and assignment of the dog to a house,

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
but the question is, do we need to separate out the different types of assignment?

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So the question is, are we missing this idea of a property name with a description attached?

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So for example, the property name would be nationality

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and the description is lived in.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Do we need to name them like that,

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
or do we just need the notion of a property group

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
to say that there are these properties of Englishman, Spaniard, Norwegian,

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Japanese, and Ukranian, and the 5 of them go together

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
but we don't need the name for them,

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
or can we ignore this notion of grouping altogether?

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This is somewhat subjective--what's a good design choice?--

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
but tell me which of these 3 do you think are plausible or reasonable design choices

66
00:04:05,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and check all that apply.
