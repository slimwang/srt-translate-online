00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,270
We'll take a minute here to do a little demonstration of

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,550
using a Hough transform that's built into MATLAB.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,760
And I'll repeat, on your problem set, you're going to be doing some Hough code.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,400
And you're not to use the Hough implementation that's already there.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,780
Nor anybody else's Hough implementation that you have from the, from the web.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,830
Because it turns out when you go and

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,180
write your Hough implementation certain things are going to break.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,900
And it's in that experience of it breaking that you're going to learn what

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,120
the important elements of it are.
