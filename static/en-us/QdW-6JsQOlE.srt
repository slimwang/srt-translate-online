If you do a jump on every node on
the list, I'll call that a jump step.

2
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:07,050
So here, I'm illustrating one jump step.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:07,730
Here's the question.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,182
Suppose the array pool is of size n,

5
00:00:11,182 --> 00:00:14,676
what's the maximum number of
jump steps you can perform?

6
00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:16,700
Here are your answer choices, pick one.
