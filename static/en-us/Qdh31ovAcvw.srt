1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,890
All right, so that ends totally our lessons on frequency.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,760
I'll bet you're glad that's over, I know I am.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,300
As I said when we started this,

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,690
if you're doing image processing as an electrical engineer, you would be

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,290
doing a ton of work analyzing images in terms of their frequency content.

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,320
And you'd be thinking about image processing operations in terms of

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,450
their frequency behavior.

8
00:00:21,506 --> 00:00:24,230
We, however, will only do this a little bit because as computer scientists we

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,310
tend of think of images more as data structures than as signals.

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,020
But we're still going to have to worry about things like frequency content when

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,640
we try to do things like optical flow where it's necessary that the image not

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,420
vary very much over some distance of approximation that I make.

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,633
So you'll actually have to do a filtering that sort of

14
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:44,930
removes that high frequency.

15
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,762
So, hopefully you now have enough understanding of Fourier analysis and

16
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:50,632
frequencies to be dangerous.

17
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:54,760
And we'll go ahead and practice being dangerous in the lectures to come.
