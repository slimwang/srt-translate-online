1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,170
So let's work on the first
item in our plan,

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,770
modifying the list item
layout to include an image.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:12,457
Notice in this screenshot, we're using
a placeholder image and each list item.

4
00:00:12,457 --> 00:00:17,835
Later on, when we get the actual images,
we'll substitute it back in.

5
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:22,495
Now in this coding task, I want you to
make the appropriate layout changes.

6
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:27,405
We want the list item to look like this,
with the placeholder image on the left.

7
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:31,633
And remember, as a hint,
to use the basket icon as

8
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:36,988
a placeholder by referring to
it as @mipmap/ic_launcher.

9
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:39,849
Since we don't have the final set
of images from our designer yet,

10
00:00:39,849 --> 00:00:42,070
let's make use of a placeholder image.

11
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,410
And we can use an image
that's already in our app, so

12
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,330
the basket icon that we used for
the app launcher icon.

13
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:53,028
And remember, that can be found
under res &gt; mipmap &gt; ic_launcher.

14
00:00:53,028 --> 00:00:54,670
And there's a number of
different sizes here.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,851
So as discussed in the hint here,
we can refer to an app icon by setting

16
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:05,156
the source of an image view
to be @mipmap/ic_launcher.

17
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:08,380
And it's called ic because
it's short for icon.

18
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,970
And launcher refers to
the Android home screen launcher.

19
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,810
So for your background information
on why we refer to the basket icon

20
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,610
by referring to it as ic_launcher,
in Android,

21
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,940
the launcher is the home screen.

22
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,540
And to get to the app store, we tap
here to see the list of all the apps.

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,460
So for our Miwok app, the basket
icon is our app launcher icon, and

24
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,100
tapping on it opens our app.

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,060
When you're done making those changes
to the list item layout XML file,

26
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,900
run the app on your device.

27
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,200
When you open up a specific category
activity, like the numbers activity,

28
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,948
each of these list items should look
like this, with a basket icon on

29
00:01:50,948 --> 00:01:54,410
the left and the Miwok and English
word stacked vertically on the right.

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,645
So I know this might look a little funny
now with all these placeholder icons,

31
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:04,585
but this is just a small step
towards building the whole feature.

32
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:09,175
So making sure that the layout is
correct and appears on the phone,

33
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:13,415
even if it has the wrong image,
means that we're on the right path.

34
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:16,085
So when you're done making
these changes, go ahead and

35
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:17,185
check this box when you're done.
