1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,660
At this point, you should have
a well-built cat clicker.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,930
Nice work.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,939
Now, I'm changing
the requirements one more time.

4
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:10,910
I promise this is the last time
I change requirements on you.

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,180
But I wanted to give you
an opportunity to fly on your own.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,450
We're going to add an admin mode.

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,220
When you click the Admin button,

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,740
it makes a new area visible with the
cat's name, URL, and number of clicks.

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,495
If I go in and change the name,
say to Fluffy, and

10
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:31,800
then I hit Save, it should update
the model with the new information, and

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,580
of course, tell the views to refresh,
which also hides admin mode.

12
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,770
So what will you need to add?

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,550
First of all, you'll need to add
some HTML for the Admin button and

14
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,130
all of this stuff here.

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,640
That will probably involve a button
here, a button here, some inputs,

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,430
labels, and a form to contain these.

17
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,730
And come to think of it,
you can add a Cancel button too.

18
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:59,450
In terms of the model, you'll probably
want a property in your model for

19
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,010
whether or
not the admin view is showing.

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,710
You can set it to true or
false with your octopus function.

21
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,530
And then based on whether it's true or
false, the view will render this or

22
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,670
not render it.

23
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,480
In your view,
you'll have an it function.

24
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,900
Which I'll call, once.

25
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,270
That'll add the event listeners
to all of these buttons here.

26
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,050
Just for a review, adding event
listeners means we're telling

27
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,140
these elements to listen for
certain events.

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,790
In this case, click events.

29
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,650
So whatever the user clicks,
we run the function.

30
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,770
Now what about the octopus?

31
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,970
In your octopus you will
have a function for

32
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,580
opening the view when you
press the Admin button.

33
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,890
A function for
closing the view when you press Cancel.

34
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,870
And a function for

35
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,880
updating the current cat with
the new values when you press Save.

36
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,910
We'll call this version
Cat Clicker Premium Pro!

37
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,150
Also, remember that this exercise
here is not meant to be super easy.

38
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,320
Another thing to notice is that the
layout of my application keeps changing.

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,990
That's to emphasize the fact
that we're not focusing on CSS.

40
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,320
Your application doesn't have
to look necessarily very pretty.

41
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,560
Just as long as
the functionality is there.

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,729
Once you're done it won't
be a ton of code, but

43
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,990
if it takes you a while to do this,
that's by design.

44
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,850
Do remember that the more often
you work with well-organized code

45
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,820
the easier changes like these will be.
