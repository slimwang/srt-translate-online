1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,842
Consider a different question,
such as what is the optimal treatment

2
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:11,170
strategy among already known and
available options, or

3
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:17,500
if a particular chronic care model
was changed in a specific way,

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,920
what would the outcomes be on
clinical quality and cost.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,320
As opposed to the classic research
question of which drug works best,

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,480
determining optimal treatment would
require many alternative experiments.

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,080
That is, trying every possible Treatment
Strategy on groups of similar patients.

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,110
To answer the second question,
an experiment could be conducted by

9
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,720
changing the clinical process
in half of the clinic and

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,440
comparing it to the other half
that is operated as before.

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,180
However, this would be costly and
complex to do.

12
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,720
These are the types of questions
best answered through modeling and

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,060
simulation using digital health data.

14
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,860
There are a number of techniques for
doing this.

15
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,290
Again, this is not an analytics course,
so we'll describe them, but

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,481
not go into the details
of how they're done.
