1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
All right, let's go over the possible answers together.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We say that a statement has to be an identifier followed by an equals sign

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
followed by an expression.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Lata, l-a-t-a, is definitely an identifier using our previous rules.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's a collection of upper and lower case letters that may include an underscore,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
but the underscore can't come first.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This is an identifier, and expression can go directly to number,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and 1 is a number, so this is totally valid.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Here we have Mangeshkar = 19 + 29.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, Mangeshkar is longer, but it's still an identifier.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's a collection of letters, and it may have underscores, but it doesn't.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And then we have the equals sign. That matches.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And now we're going to use this rule here, expression goes to expression + expression

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
to get this + sign, and then expression will go to number for 19,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and expression will go to number for 29.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I like this.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Here we have Lata = Lata + 1.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This one is tricky because it's totally valid in Python,

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
but it's not valid in this grammar.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I haven't said that expression can go to identifier,

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
so Lata is an identifier.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The equals sign is an equals sign.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But over here I need something like 1 + 1.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't yet have a rule that would allow me to have Lata + 1.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If I had this mysterious fifth rule, then this would be in the language of the grammar.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But I don't yet, so it isn't.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And then over here, Mangeshkar = 25,000 - 1,

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
that's an identifier =,

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and now we're going to use this rule here, expression - expression.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This totally works out.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Lata Mangeshkar is a famous Indian playback singer.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
She's recorded over 25,000 songs,

33
00:01:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
a world record for quite some time, and she's also received India's highest civilian honor.
