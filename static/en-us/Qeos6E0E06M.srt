1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So let's up the ante and say we have a coin that has a certain probability

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
of coming up with heads--again, it might be 0.5.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Just like before it will be an input to the function f and now I'm going to flip the coin 3 times

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and I want you to calculate the probability that the heads comes up exactly once.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Three is not a variable so you could only works for 3 flips not for 2 or 4

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but the only input variable is going to be the coin probability 0.5.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So please change this code to express that number.
