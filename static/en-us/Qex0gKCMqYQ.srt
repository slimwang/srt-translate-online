1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,880
Consider the following scenario.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,230
An RPC call fails and
returns a timeout message.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,260
Given this timeout message,
what is the reason for

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,120
the RPC failure, that can be
concluded by the RPC run time?

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,370
Here are the options that are available.

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,310
The client packet was lost.

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,190
The server packet was lost.

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,270
The network link was down.

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,616
The server machine was down.

10
00:00:22,616 --> 00:00:25,530
The server process failed.

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,470
The server process was overloaded.

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,330
All of the above.

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Or any of the above.

14
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,234
Check all that apply.
