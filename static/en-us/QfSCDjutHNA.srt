00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:10,028
so far in visualizing algebra. Let's try another factoring trinomial problem. 2a

3
00:00:10,028 --> 00:00:17,650
cubed b, minus 28a squared b squared, plus 96ab cubed. Don't let the problem

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,663
intimidate you. There's nothing to be afraid of. Just use what you've been

5
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:24,923
learning to factor this trinomial. You can put your answer over here.
