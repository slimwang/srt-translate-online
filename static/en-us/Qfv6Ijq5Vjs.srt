00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,774
Remember how we talked about actually writing code to do intersection between

2
00:00:03,774 --> 00:00:07,759
two rectangles? We've actually abstracted that away and actually turned it into

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,401
a function inside of gMaps. You can call gMap.intersectRect. The isVisible

4
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:15,163
function is actually a nice little helper that will pass in the viewRect and the

5
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:19,039
rectangle for this tile Into the intersectRect function to determine whether or

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,861
not this tile is visible to the current view rectangle. This is a helpful little

7
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:26,568
function that we'll utilize in a couple different places moving forward. Now,

8
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:30,198
before moving forward let's go ahead and write this intersectRect function so

9
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:33,553
that it takes two rectangles with top, bottom, left, and right values and

10
00:00:33,553 --> 00:00:35,523
returns whether or not they intersect.
