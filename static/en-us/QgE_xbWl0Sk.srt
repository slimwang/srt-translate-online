1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,580
All right. We already knew that lines B and

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,260
D should be in the final list, since they were in both files.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,240
Before, we didn't really know whether the lines had been there at the beginning

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,110
of the day or whether Jake and Rachel had both added them.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,930
But now we know, it was already there.

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:14,660
Now let's look at A.

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,660
At the beginning of the day, line A was present.

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,890
Rachel's file still contains it, so she didn't do anything with it.

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,720
But Jake's file doesn't contain it.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,790
That means that he removed line A.

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,710
So we don't want it in the final file.

12
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,850
Now let's look at C.

13
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,980
C doesn't appear in the original and Jake doesn't have it either, but

14
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,870
Rachel does.

15
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,120
Since it wasn't there to begin with,

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,690
we know that she added it, so it should be in the file.

17
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,650
The same thing goes for E.

18
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,330
Since it's not in the original, but Jake has it,

19
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,730
we do want it in the final file.
