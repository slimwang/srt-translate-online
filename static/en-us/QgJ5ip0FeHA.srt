00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,770
The radio is powered by electricity from a wall socket at not a battery.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,390
It can be controlled by two manual knobs. One for volume on the top right and

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,920
one for tuning on the right side. The chosen frequency is displayed on

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,750
the right side of the front panel with a small vertical white bar.

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,490
The display features a twelve hour clock on the left front and

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,940
two small lights. The light in the upper left hand corner of

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,960
the display labeled AM indicates whether the displayed time is in the morning,

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,780
when the light is off or in the afternoon or evening when the light is on.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,050
The light in the lower right hand corner of the display is labeled wake.

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,990
If it is lit indicates you have armed the alarm. In addition to the above,

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,540
the radio has two switches and five buttons. One of the switches on the top edge

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,110
of the back determines whether the frequency band is set to AM or FM.

13
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:56,790
The second switch found in the center front of the top has four positions.

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,340
The switch slides horizontally from left to right. In order,

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:06,420
the positions indicate whether the radio is on, off, armed for wake by radio or

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,200
armed for wake via a beeping sound. Four buttons are found on the left side of

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,500
the top of the radio. They can be used to set various timers in the clock.

18
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,760
They are labeled hour, min, wake, and sleep. By pressing the wake button,

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,180
you can set the time you wish the alarm to go off. By pressing the sleep button,

20
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,390
you can set how long you would like the radio to play before automatically

21
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,770
shutting off. Using this feature allows you to fall asleep with the radio

22
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,890
playing. If neither button is pressed you can set the current time of day.

23
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,600
You've actually set these three timers using the other two button on the front

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,220
left of the top of the radio, they are labeled hour and min. By pressing hour

25
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,680
you increment the hour of, of the respective timer, the wake, sleep or time of

26
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,770
day timer. Similarly for min, if you wish to be awakened 15 minutes later

27
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,440
tomorrow morning than you were this morning you would hold down the wake button

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,960
while pressing the min button 15 times. The final button is the snooze button.

29
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,540
It is the large button found in the center front of the top of the radio.

30
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,780
The snooze button is useful when the alarm is trying to wake you up.

31
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,520
Each time you hit the snooze button the alarm shuts off for

32
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,470
10 minutes. The final feature to note about the radio is that the alarm will

33
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,640
automatically turn itself off after one hour, to prevent the situation where you

34
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,070
forgot to turn it off and it was audible all day long.
