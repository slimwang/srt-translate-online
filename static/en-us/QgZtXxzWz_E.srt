00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,880
This lesson is about doing a search or
BFS on a distributive memory system.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,680
But we're going to approach the problem
from the perspective of linear algebra.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,420
As it happens, there's a way
to view a graph as a matrix.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,540
And since we have a pretty

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,830
good understanding of how to do linear
algebra in distributive memory,

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,520
we can exploit this mapping
to get a scalable algorithm.

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,660
Now one suggestion I have for you before
we start is for you to quickly review

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,070
some of the ideas from our other lesson
on distributive matrix computations.

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,120
You'll use several of those ideas here,
too.
