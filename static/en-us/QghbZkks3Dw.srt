00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,110
Http is the core technology that
handles how data is exchanged over

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,010
the World Wide Web, so
let's discuss that for a bit.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,840
Http stands for hypertext transfer
protocol and hails from the earlier days

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,330
of the web when computers transmitted
just basic webpage information.

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,310
So what is a protocol?

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,940
Well, a protocol is simply a predefined
set of rules that allows computers to

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,470
communicate and coordinate with one
another in order to complete a task.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,164
In this case,
that goal is to exchange messages and

9
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:34,200
or data across the internet.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,850
Well, how does this communication work?

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,330
Client computers, talking HTTP,

12
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:45,450
transmit messages containing
specific HTTP methods, or verbs,

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,445
that convey their intention or request
to a receiving computer or server.

14
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:54,455
The server receives and
interprets the message, reacts, and

15
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:58,025
then sends a response back through
the internet to the client.

16
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:01,605
This is a request and
response exchange paradigm.

17
00:01:01,605 --> 00:01:05,245
Here are some examples of the most
commonly used HTP methods or

18
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:06,345
verbs used today.

19
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:08,930
Here's a GET.

20
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,050
Get means I'd like to get or
retrieve some data from you.

21
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,100
Server will respond with okay,
here's your information.

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,580
A post means I'd like to
create some new information.

23
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,360
A put means I'd like to update
some existing information.

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,040
Now, the server doesn't always
have to respond with a thumbs up.

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,195
Maybe something went wrong.

26
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:32,530
Maybe it doesn't know what
you're talking about.

27
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,870
And it could yield some sort
of unsatisfactory response.

28
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,983
Delete, just simply means that I'd like
to delete some existing information on

29
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:42,230
the server.

30
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,740
This was a quick overview of
the most commonly used HTP verbs but

31
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,730
you can find the complete
set linked below.

32
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,934
Typical web browsing tasks
like loading Facebook or

33
00:01:51,934 --> 00:01:55,630
Google.com can consist of
hundreds of http requests.

34
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,290
What I'm want to do now is use
Chrome developer tools to show you

35
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:03,240
exactly what's getting loaded into
Google.com when we reload the page.

36
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,380
Developer tools has a number of useful
pieces of information and in this

37
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,310
case we going to click on the network
tab and I'm going to reload Google.com.

38
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,240
And we can see all
the little things that come

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,850
loading into the page right here.

40
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,720
See, some of them are documents,
some are images, some are scripts.

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,220
In the same way, EPI exchanges
contain multiple requests, but

42
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,140
are often an order of magnitude
smaller than loading a web page

43
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,240
mainly because there's so
much less data and media to load.
