1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For a the answer is 0 and 0.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
A can only ever be 0.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
To see this, recall that a is equal to y-bar - b x-bar,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
but for a standard score, zₓ always has a mean of 0 and zᵧ has a mean of 0,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
because we subtracted out their means.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
A must always be 0.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
B must always be between -1 and 1.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:43,000
To see this, recall that--as you just discovered--b is equal to r times

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
times the standard deviation of y over the standard deviation of x.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Since these are each 1, their ratio is 1,

11
00:00:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so b must have the same range as r from -1 to 1.
