00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,760
Now let's discuss misuse or
signature detection.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,200
These techniques detect intrusions
by looking at activity data,

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,680
seeing if there's a match of
known intrusion patterns, and

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,060
if there's a match this
activity is intrusion.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,490
Otherwise it is normal.
