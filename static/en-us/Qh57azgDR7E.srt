00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,220
Okay, it's time to do
a little bit of math.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,470
To start off with, we know we have
1920 hardware pixels across, and

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,870
the device pixel ratio
of two tells us that for

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,880
every one CSS pixel,
there are two hardware pixels.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,880
Multiplying 1920 by one half
gives us 960 CSS pixels,

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,319
so the correct answer here is 960.
