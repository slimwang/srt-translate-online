00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,121
Now that you know that every integer is a
rational number. That means we should be

2
00:00:04,121 --> 00:00:09,039
able to write every single integer in the
form of a rational number. Which remember

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:17,996
is a/b, where a and b are both integers,
and b is not = 0. So how could you express

4
00:00:17,996 --> 00:00:24,337
-17 in this form? Please enter values for
a and b to make a fraction equivalent to

5
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:30,020
-17 in the slots below. There are a ton of
different ways you can do this, so just

6
00:00:30,035 --> 00:00:34,166
pick one combination of a and b that you
think will work and try it out.
