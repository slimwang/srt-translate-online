00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,248
So now, let's talk a little bit about digital image formats.

2
00:00:03,248 --> 00:00:05,370
Basically again, raster image formats, again,

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,690
the ones that as I said on a matrix, representation scan, row,

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,460
column lies down to rows, well each and every one of those elements is a pixel.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,540
And basically in each and every image is nothing else but

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,780
a se, series of colored dots with intensity values.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,480
In the last slide, I kind of started getting into this whole concept of

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,620
number of bits for each pixel represents the depth of color.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,650
Well, again, one bit per pixel would just be a two color image where black or

10
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,700
white would be represented.

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,110
Four bits would be 16 colors, eight bits would be 256 different colors.

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,200
And again if you keep on scaling this,

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,646
remember, the equation that we looked at was where n.

14
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:49,020
n would be 8 for a regular 0 to 255 image.

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,930
And just reviewing from last one again, images can be 16, 24 bit,

16
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,258
and 32 bits-per-pixel.

17
00:00:57,258 --> 00:01:01,700
A 24-bit pixel is usually the one that has 8 bits per color.

18
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,670
At the highest levels, the pixels themselves can carry up

19
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,020
to 16 million different types of colors depending on again how,

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,020
what bits of pixels which we're ta, trying to use.

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,840
Common raster image formats and

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,440
this is some things which again you've seen from your cameras a lot,

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,200
is basically allowing you to be able to look at images in various formats.

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,890
GIF or GIF is one more prominent one.

25
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,380
JPG and PPM, TIF, bpm, BMP, many variety of things exist.

26
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,400
I'm not today discussing the camera RAW format.

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,950
We will talk about that later because that's a special format that's coming in.

28
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,850
That actually captures the information directly from the sensor and

29
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,425
stores that into a file for later pre-processing kinds of stuff or

30
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:46,810
post-processing kinds of stuff.
