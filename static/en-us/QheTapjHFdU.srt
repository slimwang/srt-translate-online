1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,196
Now you've seen that by knowing the mean and standard deviation of a normally

2
00:00:05,196 --> 00:00:10,623
distributed population, we can compare any value in that population to the rest

3
00:00:10,623 --> 00:00:15,888
of the population by determining the percent less than or the percent greater

4
00:00:15,888 --> 00:00:20,867
than that value. But what about for a sample, how can we compare a particular

5
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:25,872
sample in a population to other samples in that population? By finding the mean

6
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:31,038
of this sample, by finding the means of other samples in this population, or

7
00:00:31,038 --> 00:00:36,752
maybe by comparing the mean of this sample to the other samples. Check all that

8
00:00:36,752 --> 00:00:37,429
apply.
