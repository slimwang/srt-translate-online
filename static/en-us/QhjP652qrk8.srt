00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,435
So which of the following are

2
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:05,390
characteristics of network virtualization, but not necessarily

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,950
characteristics of SDN? Be careful, the distinction

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,530
between SDN and virtual networks was as

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:17,800
we discussed in the previous part of this lesson. Allowing multiple tenants to

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,930
share underlying physical infrastructure. Controlling behavior from

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,440
a logically centralized controller. Separating logical and

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,520
physical networks. Or separating data and control planes.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,510
Again, please feel free to check all that apply.
