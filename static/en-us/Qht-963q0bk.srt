1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,660
So I'm here with Courtney Drake,
who's a product manager here at Udacity.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,000
So thank you for talking to us today.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,830
>> Absolutely.

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,540
>> So the first thing I wanted to ask
was that, there's this perception for

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,210
online education that's very
disconnected and impersonal.

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,610
And does that necessarily
have to be the case?

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,640
>> I don't think it does.

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,530
And I would say that's something
that we have really focused on.

9
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,840
Udacity is the kind of research and
our experience with students,

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,190
that social learning is more
effective than not social learning.

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,590
And so that's something that we have
really actually invested in quite a bit,

12
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,350
especially this year.

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,500
I think the challenge with
social learning is that you

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,750
still want to preserve some of
the core benefits of online learning,

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,570
like self-pacing and
students' ability to kind of

16
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,360
have their learning schedule be
flexible around their life schedule.

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,130
So those kind of butt up against
the ability to connect students and

18
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,560
have them really build deep
connections with each other,

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,960
when their are not really in
a synchronous environment.

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,490
I think those are some
of the challenges.

21
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:05,390
We focus on a couple of different
ways of integrating, Interaction,

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,860
and collaboration into our
online learning platform.

23
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,990
The first way is through forums.

24
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,300
And through forums, we've really focused
on, how can we help students help each

25
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,560
other, and help them answer each other's
questions, and share with each other,

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,740
and share with a broader
community of students.

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,630
But it turns out that it
hasn't really been enough for

28
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,580
students to feel like
they are in a community.

29
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,470
Especially,say, when it's a nano degree
community that 500 plus students, it's

30
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,350
really hard to feel like I"m connected
to those other 499 other students.

31
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,610
So we've moved more recently
in addition to forums,

32
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:45,160
is small learning communities
that we're calling teams.

33
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,980
So when students sign up for
a nano degree,

34
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,850
this is kind of rolling
out progressively.

35
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,160
They get matched up with a group of
ten to 12 other students who they

36
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,859
then have a chat room with through the
course of their nano degree experience.

37
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:00,840
And what we're hoping will
kind of happen through that is

38
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,230
they build a personal connection
with those other students.

39
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,655
And that's kind of their first point
of contact if they have a question,

40
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:08,650
is run it by my team members.

41
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,420
If we can answer it ourselves awesome,
and if not then we're posting to

42
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,870
the forums or going to coach support
to ask for support from Udacity.

43
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,920
And we're hoping that will
kind of help with three

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,120
problems around social learning,
one is accountability,

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,470
is feeling like there are other people
who care about my progress, and

46
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,830
if I drop off that doesn't just
effect me, that effect other people.

47
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,570
The other is just a level of engagement.

48
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,460
I don't feel like I'm alone.

49
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,900
And the third piece is if
I'm helping other people and

50
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,750
I'm teaching other people,
I actually learn more that way.

51
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,700
So having those connections where
we can kind of have a back and

52
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,960
forth chat exchange,

53
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,240
can actually deepen what I'm learning
if I'm the one who's the helper.

54
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,520
>> Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

55
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,890
I think that exactly what you just
described is something we try and

56
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,470
create in our OMS classes, which we
do it on piatza right now at least.

57
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,010
And I think we exactly try and create
that, is a lot of interaction among

58
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,220
students and very frequent interactions,
so that I feel like there is a community

59
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,430
here, present right now, and if I write
something I'm going to get a response.

60
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,300
>> Yeah.
>> Pretty quick and

61
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,890
pretty targeted to
what I'm talking about.

62
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,190
Another interesting thing that
happens in the OMS community is that

63
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,340
the largest social community around it
is actually a student run community.

64
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,750
It's run by several students who
created the Google Plus community.

65
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,210
And I think that creates a lot
of interesting ownership.

66
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,330
Because it's student run it's not this
kind of thing that I'm being handed and

67
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,990
being asked to play by your rules.

68
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,950
Is there anything we can do when
designing online technologies or

69
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,820
educational technology in general
to kind of allow room for

70
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,350
these kind of student driven
communities to emerge?

71
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,080
>> Yeah, so when we've
experimented with how do we help

72
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,730
students create small communities.

73
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,230
And when we have just kind of
let them have a free for all,

74
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,260
we found that they don't,
it's like some students start it, and

75
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,600
the really driven students will
start smaller communities.

76
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,590
And it's really awesome
when they do that, and

77
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,520
we've seen some great interaction.

78
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,500
But the norm is not,
I'm going to start a community or

79
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,140
I'm going to join a community on my own.

80
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,530
And so we've actually felt like we've
needed to give students more structure

81
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,660
to form those communities.

82
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,210
That's just why we have facilitated
this way of having them

83
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,680
join a team from the very beginning.

84
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,160
We say, tell us you're availability.

85
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
We will put you in a team.

86
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,740
And then let them go from there.

87
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,400
So we felt like we actually
needed to create that structure.

88
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,490
And I guess we'll see if,
how the ownership plays out there.

89
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,430
And even when we've
experimented with that,

90
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,960
saying we're going to actually
put you in teams together.

91
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,920
We found that, unless one student really
steps up into some kind of leadership

92
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,810
role, they kind of fall flat.

93
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,510
And so, where we've said, okay,

94
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:38,300
how do we scale really solid community
interaction if we don't necessarily

95
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,210
know who those students are who are
going to step up into a leadership role?

96
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,530
And so, they actually see it
the idea for a guides program,

97
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,430
is what we're calling it.

98
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,250
Where we're enlisting students who are
farther ahead in nano degree programs,

99
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,010
who have graduated, to come back and
be a guide for our teams.

100
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,040
So, they're coming to weekly
sessions with those teams.

101
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,090
And they're engaging in chat with
those teams throughout the week,

102
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,910
to really help them foster a sense of
community, and get to a point where

103
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,320
they're really gelling and can carry
themselves forward on their own.

104
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,080
So that's something we've just started.

105
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,710
It's pretty cool,

106
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,600
because it is actually students who
are coming back into that fray.

107
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,270
And it's actually really nice kind of
a motivational piece, to kind of say,

108
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,110
look at this other student who is in
the same place I was three months ago.

109
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,510
And look at all they know.

110
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,960
And maybe they even have a job
already that I want to get.

111
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,410
Eventually.
So it's a nice piece of motivation, and

112
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,200
it's also a way for

113
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,860
us to kind of have feet on the ground,
know what's going on.

114
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,790
And make sure that those
communities are healthy and strong.

115
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,230
>> That actually sounds very similar
to what we do in the EOS program,

116
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,570
because what you describe
is very similar to TAs.

117
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,940
When we solicit next semester's
TAs from this semester's students.

118
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,870
And I think it works really nicely
when we have a big group of very,

119
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,900
very good students who
are passionate about helping.

120
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,660
>> Yeah.
>> Who aren't just,

121
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,220
you know,
crossing an item of a to-do list, but

122
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,660
really enjoy helping out
their fellow students.

123
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,540
>> Yeah.
>> Perhaps, one of the most

124
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,030
inspiring things about
the LMS program is that

125
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,030
we see a lot more of those students
who want to help each other and

126
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,160
want to come back and work on it and
contribute to the class.

127
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,410
So yeah, it's been very inspiring
[INAUDIBLE] work nicely.

128
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,040
>> Yeah.

129
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,570
>> So
one thing I've noticed also is that

130
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,460
we have a stereotype that online
education is impersonal, disconnected.

131
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,240
And then, like you just said,

132
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,975
that there are ways we can
actually compensate for that.

133
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:18,810
>> Mm-hm.

134
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,700
>> But are there times when
the online environment actually makes

135
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,130
it even better than it could
be in person, do you think?

136
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,220
I definitely think that there are times,
for sure.

137
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,810
And one piece of it is the geographical
reach that we get with online learning.

138
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,420
Is that we have students who
are connecting from all over the world.

139
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,040
And that's a really
powerful experience for

140
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,180
someone who has never done that before.

141
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,370
And if you're all in the same place,
you don't get that kind of diversity of

142
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,330
perspective that you do with
a global learning community.

143
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,840
So we definitely have that piece.

144
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,340
The other piece is that if it's less
synchronous and people are running on

145
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,850
their own schedules, it means
they're kind of available whenever.

146
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,020
We've actually leveraged mbile for
this with the team feature that

147
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,930
we just released where we have mobile
chat apps on both iOS and Android.

148
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,330
So I've had this happen with my own
team which I'm participating in,

149
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,660
where I will be at a dinner or
something.

150
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,030
And I see that my team chats something.

151
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,330
And I can just pop back in and
answer a question.

152
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,290
So they come ubiquitous.

153
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,010
Nature of the internet,

154
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:28,160
really helps students connect
more frequently with each

155
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,673
other than just if we're having a class
once a week or something like that.

156
00:07:31,673 --> 00:07:36,050
It keeps and keeps the communication
flow happening more easily.

157
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,860
>> Yeah, I agree completely.

158
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,760
I think one of my experiences being
an instructor in this program has been

159
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,840
that I can sign onto Piazza that we
use for our forums right now, and

160
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,330
in five minutes, I can interact
with ten different students.

161
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,300
>> Yeah.
>> And come back an hour later

162
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,320
and do it again.

163
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,940
And in person you
really can't have that.

164
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,520
>> Right..
