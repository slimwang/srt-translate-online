1
00:00:00,472 --> 00:00:03,410
All right, so now it's time for
you to do this by yourself.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,400
But I'll get you started off.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,440
So head over to the data package and

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,760
create a new class
called PetDbHelper.java.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,770
In that class we'll extend
our SQLiteOpenHelper class.

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,183
Now when you extend SQLiteOpenHelper,
remember that you'll need to

7
00:00:20,183 --> 00:00:23,782
override the onCreate method and
the onUpgrade method.

8
00:00:23,782 --> 00:00:28,010
And you should create constants for
the database name and version.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,299
Also, don't forget the constructor for
the class.

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,880
So remember to also create
a string constant for

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,420
the SQLite command used
to create the table.

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,710
Now that we have this statement from our
cheat sheet, instead of just copying and

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,310
pasting it, we can use the constants
from the contract class.

14
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,330
And remember, these values here,
we've created constants for

15
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,180
those values as well,
so be sure to use them.

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,470
So, all the changes that you've
been making are hard to check.

17
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,400
So itâ€™s hard to see and
know if they're correct.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,880
We'll, I'm going to give you
two ways in order to see

19
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,260
if your database is working correctly.

20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,060
So, the first way is a mysterious
method we've created

21
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,060
called displayDatabaseInfo.

22
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,060
And I like you to copy and
paste this code Into your code and

23
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,920
it will only work if SQL
is working correctly.

24
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,091
Now, the second way is actually
downloading the SQLite database file,

25
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:28,730
from your drive onto your computer.

26
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:32,807
And you can then through that examine,
if it was constructed correctly in

27
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:36,902
the terminal, using the techniques
that you learned in the last lesson.

28
00:01:36,902 --> 00:01:41,207
So we'll discuss how to download
the database shortly but for

29
00:01:41,207 --> 00:01:46,370
now let me show you the first option
of using the displayDatabase method.

30
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,240
So here is the code for
our displayDatabaseInfo method.

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,490
And I know we haven't
discussed it just yet, so

32
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,530
don't about its contents right now.

33
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,550
So by the end of this lesson,

34
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,650
you'll be able to understand
what all this code means.

35
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,500
And to follow along,

36
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,180
I highly suggest taking a look
at the full code link below.

37
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,350
I'd like you to copy over this
method into your CatalogActivity and

38
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,650
I want you to include it at
the end of the onCreate method.

39
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,070
Then run the application on your device.

40
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,290
And if you did all the steps correctly,

41
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,800
you should see some text outputted here,
in the CatalogActivity.

42
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,980
So you'll see number of
rows in pets database table

43
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,170
followed by a number which
I've covered up here.

44
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,940
So, if you don't see this sentence
on your catalog activity screen,

45
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,060
look over the steps above.

46
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,730
So, make sure that
the displayDatabaseInfo method

47
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,000
is correctly in the onCreate
method of our CatalogActivity.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,570
And also double check to make sure
that your SQL statement is correct.

49
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,505
So finish up this exercise and

50
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:52,980
I'd like you write one number that you
see here, once you have the app running.

51
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,510
So if you find yourself
running to some trouble,

52
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,690
here's a little troubleshooting tip.

53
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,780
So Android will throw an SQLiteException
error when something is incorrect

54
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,810
in the SQLite statement.

55
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:09,674
So just maybe I've misspelled the word
create, leaving off the last e.

56
00:03:09,674 --> 00:03:13,282
So if your app does crash and
you see an error output,

57
00:03:13,282 --> 00:03:17,962
it most likely means something is
messed up with SQLite's string.

58
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:20,634
And it's just not
a valid SQLite command.

59
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,447
So don't worry if this does happen,

60
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:25,598
it just takes a little bit
of investigative work.

61
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:27,420
And Android is there to help you help,

62
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,260
giving you some tips
as to where to look.

63
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,870
So to iterate, here's what I'd like you
to do in order to create a database

64
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,510
with SQLiteOpenHelper class.

65
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,770
Follow these five steps for
the SQLiteOpenHelper class.

66
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,160
And I'd like you to log the SQL
statement string to make sure it matches

67
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,770
the SQL statement we've
listed on the cheat sheet.

68
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,330
Lastly, I want you to write the number
that you see when you run your code.

69
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,830
And write that number in right here.
