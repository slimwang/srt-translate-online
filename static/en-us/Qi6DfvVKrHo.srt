1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,800
So what about this term
continuous deployment?

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,580
What's the difference between it and
continues delivery?

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,070
The continuous delivery process proves

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,900
that a specific code check-in
is production ready and

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,980
it then prepares it for deployment by
building and comprehensively testing it.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,460
But there is usually a human
involved at the last stage.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,160
It's usually a QA, or
operation sign off.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,890
In some cases it's
a product order sign off.

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,400
And sometimes this is a step where the
pipeline will continue after some time

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,760
automatically, unless one
of these people interferes.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,300
But with continuous delivery,
there are always one or

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,200
more possible manual interaction
points in the pipeline.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,280
The converse of that is that
there are no manual steps and

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,100
the code can completely automatically
go from check in to the customer.

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,350
And this is called
continuous deployment.

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,230
Usually continuous
deployment is used for

17
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,720
stable software that has been around for
a long time.

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,380
And because it's stable, most of these
changes are small and bug fixes.

19
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,590
For software that's being actively
developed a lot of times the software

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,580
can change pretty dramatically.

21
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,560
If you're adding new features,
it's not particularly good to have

22
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,720
a completely automated process where
nobody manually checks it over.

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,910
It's also very hard to automate
user acceptance criteria for

24
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,200
software that's constantly changing.
