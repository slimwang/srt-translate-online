1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:04,682
So if you recall the value array, it is simply the non-zero elements of this input array,

2
00:00:04,682 --> 00:00:07,035
which we'll just fill in here.

3
00:00:08,818 --> 00:00:14,301
The index array here is which column each of these array elements are in.

4
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:18,862
So the 1 is in column 0, the 2 is in column 2,

5
00:00:18,862 --> 00:00:24,001
the 2 here is in column 0, the 1 here is in column 1,

6
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:29,507
this 1 is also in column 1, and this final 3 is in column 2.

7
00:00:29,507 --> 00:00:35,139
Finally, what are the indices of each one of these elements that actually begins a row?

8
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:41,465
So we should look for the index of this 1, the index of this 2, and the index of this 1

9
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:44,794
because they are what begin each one of these rows.

10
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:48,085
That's this element, this element, and this element.

11
00:00:48,085 --> 00:00:52,789
This element is the zeroth element, this element is the second element,

12
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:55,055
and this element here is the fourth element.

13
00:00:55,055 --> 00:01:00,094
So this is the CSR representation of this sparse matrix here.
