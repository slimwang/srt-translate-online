1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,260
So, let's now apply the idea of pipelining to

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,150
laundry and let's do a quiz on that. Let's

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,230
say we have a washer, a dryer and some

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,782
sort of a folder device for laundry. And let's say

5
00:00:12,782 --> 00:00:15,026
the washer takes 1 hour to process a load

6
00:00:15,026 --> 00:00:18,658
of laundry. The dryer takes 1 hour to process

7
00:00:18,658 --> 00:00:21,668
a load of laundry, and the folder takes 1

8
00:00:21,668 --> 00:00:25,472
hour to fold a load of laundry. Let's say you

9
00:00:25,472 --> 00:00:28,307
have 10 loads of laundry that you want to

10
00:00:28,307 --> 00:00:31,902
do. With no pipelining, how many hours does it

11
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:34,998
take to process these 10 loads of laundry through

12
00:00:34,998 --> 00:00:39,050
this? And with pipelining, how many hours does it take?
