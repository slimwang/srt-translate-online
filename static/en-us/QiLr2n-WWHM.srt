00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,325
>> A conditioned taste aversion can occur when an organism ingests something and

2
00:00:03,325 --> 00:00:07,900
it makes them ill. For example, Susan here has a conditioned taste aversion to

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,390
Moo Shu Pork. So Susan, how does that make you feel?

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:12,406
[LAUGH]

5
00:00:12,406 --> 00:00:18,872
>> Oh gosh, I feel I feel like I might want to vomit and I'm salivating and I

6
00:00:18,872 --> 00:00:23,144
don't like it at all.

7
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:24,296
>> I'm sorry, I'll, I'll put it down.

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,542
>> Susan's nausea and sickness is paired with the sight, the smell and the taste

9
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:34,706
of the food. So from an evolutionary perspective, this makes sense. We should

10
00:00:34,706 --> 00:00:37,769
try to avoid things in the future that have made us ill. So sorry, Susan that

11
00:00:37,769 --> 00:00:40,422
was just a little payback for Tickles the snake.

12
00:00:40,422 --> 00:00:41,510
>> I forgive you, Lauren.

13
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,894
>> Thanks.

14
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:46,330
>> Here we can see that condition taste aversion happens after only one trial.

15
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,490
That's different from classical conditioning, where we have repeated

16
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,590
presentations. For example, I got sick on Moo Shu Pork over ten years ago, and

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,023
as you can see today, I still can't stomach it. So, let's move away from the

18
00:00:58,023 --> 00:01:01,656
Moo Shu Pork example. I'd like to finish this lesson on classical conditioning

19
00:01:01,656 --> 00:01:04,617
by talking about a study that classically conditioned a sexual response to

20
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:06,550
women's black boots.
