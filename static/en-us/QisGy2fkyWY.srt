1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,341
So now that we have seen
the concept of multi level caches,

2
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:06,887
let's see how L2 and L1 compare.

3
00:00:06,887 --> 00:00:09,186
So which of these statements are true?

4
00:00:09,186 --> 00:00:13,423
The L1 capacity is
less than L2 capacity.

5
00:00:13,423 --> 00:00:18,148
The L1 latency is less than L2 latency.

6
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:22,812
The number of accesses that go to
L1 is is less than the number of

7
00:00:22,812 --> 00:00:24,662
accesses that go to L2.

8
00:00:24,662 --> 00:00:30,130
And the L1 associativity has to
be equal to L2 associativity.

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,860
So again, check all of
the statements that should be true.
