1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,277
Alright! So, let's I mean, what we'd really like to get to

2
00:00:03,277 --> 00:00:06,298
are algorithms for doing optimization, and I think to do that it's

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:09,304
helpful to do a quiz. So, here is a little a quiz

4
00:00:09,304 --> 00:00:13,520
that I put together, I call it Optimize Me. And what I

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,870
want you to do is, is here's two different problems, there's two

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,420
different input spaces, two different functions, and I want you to find

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,630
the optimal x-star or something really close to it, if you can't

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,700
get it exactly right. So, the first question we've got the input

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,590
space x is the values one to 100. And the function that we're trying to optimize

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:38,030
is x mod 6 squared mod 7 minus the sin of x.

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,140
>> Holy cow.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,990
>> Yeah, it's, it is an awesome looking function. Do you want to

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,420
see it? I, I might be able to plot it for you.

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,900
>> Sure, I'd love to see plots, because then

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,980
maybe I'll know how to figure out the answer.

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,680
>> Yeah oh yeah well maybe I should not then,

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,442
maybe I should wait until we already have an answer and then yeah,

18
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:58,006
let's, let's wait but I'll show you after it. It's, it's, it's crazy.

19
00:00:58,006 --> 00:00:59,212
>> [Laughs]

20
00:00:59,212 --> 00:01:03,910
>> Alright it's beautiful. So okay good, so and the

21
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:08,870
second problem we've got x as the set of real

22
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,400
numbers, so all, any, any possible number in the reals.

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,700
And the function that we're trying to optimize is negative

24
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,132
x to the 4th plus 1000x cubed minus 20x squared plus 4x

25
00:01:19,132 --> 00:01:21,000
minus 6. Alright, so you understand

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,970
the questions? I understand the questions, yes.

27
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,410
>> Good, good luck with them.
