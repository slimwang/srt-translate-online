Here are some solutions to the problem just outlined. The drawing the red

2
00:00:03,774 --> 00:00:08,328
transparent object first causes the blue object to not be seen by the camera and

3
00:00:08,328 --> 00:00:12,917
blended in properly. Which of these solutions will solve this particular case?

4
00:00:12,918 --> 00:00:17,400
More than one answer can be correct. First is, draw all objects sorted by size,

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,042
small to large. Draw all objects sorted back to front order. Draw all objects as

6
00:00:22,042 --> 00:00:27,081
if they're all transparent, blending each one. And finally, draw the fully

7
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:30,474
opaque objects first, transparent later.
