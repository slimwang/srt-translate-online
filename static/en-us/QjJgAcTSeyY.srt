00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,760
This is the original XML
that we provided you.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,510
It was a vertical linear layout.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,090
And the items were appearing
in a vertical column.

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,220
According to the image in the quiz,

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,930
we want the item to look more like
a list item using a relative layout.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,680
Here's the solution.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,460
We've changed the layout so
that the photo is on the left and

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,020
the three text views are on
the right hand side.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,210
In order to build this layout I changed
the root view to be a relative layout

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,180
instead of a linear layout.

11
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,530
Since this is the opening tag,

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,700
I also had to update
the closing tag at the bottom.

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,610
Between the opening and closing
tags we have four children views.

14
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,200
I also removed the vertical
orientation attribute

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,580
because that belonged
to the linear layout.

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,240
There's no orientation attribute
needed for the relative layout.

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,750
The photo was already
positioned correctly.

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,400
The first child of a relative layout
is always positioned by default in

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,270
the top left corner.

20
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,440
And that's what we want for
our list item, so this stays the same.

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,720
Next we have the TextView
that says Pebble Beach.

22
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,410
We want to position this TextView to the
right of the ImageView, so we need to

23
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:10,180
add the attribute layout_torightof and
then reference the image view.

24
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,800
In order to reference the ImageView
we had to add an ID attribute,

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,400
to the ImageView.

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,100
I just called it photo, but you can
call it something else if you wanted.

27
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,260
That correctly positioned the image,
and the first TextView.

28
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,740
The next TextView is for
showing the text California.

29
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,498
The California TextView has to be
positioned to the right of the photo and

30
00:01:29,498 --> 00:01:32,110
must be below the Pebble Beach TextView.

31
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,510
So, first we add attribute
layout_toRightof and

32
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,890
reference the photo.

33
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,620
Then we add another
attribute layout below and

34
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,880
then we reference the first TextView.

35
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,860
That required also adding an ID for this
first TextView, we just called it name.

36
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,060
Cool, so that position,
the ImageView, and the two TextViews.

37
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,622
Lastly, we have the TextView that
shows the distance, 10 miles away.

38
00:01:53,622 --> 00:01:55,420
It's positioned to
the right of the image and

39
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,890
below the California text view.

40
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,370
Thus, we had to add the attribute
layout_toRightof in reference

41
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,730
to the photo, and we also had to
add an attribute for layout below,

42
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,008
and then reference
the location TextView.

43
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:13,280
This involved adding the ID for
the location TextView as well.

44
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,960
I also added an ID for
the distance TextView.

45
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,030
Even though we're not
referencing it anywhere,

46
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,340
it doesn't hurt to add an ID to a view.

47
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,560
In the case that you do need to refer
to it later, it's already there.
