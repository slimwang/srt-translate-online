1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,310
Principal components.

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:06,190
So, fundamentally, principal
components are about the directions.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:11,150
The component is really a direction in
a featured space along which the points

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,040
that you care about in that space have
the greatest variation or variants.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,420
We'll make all of this more formal,
in a minute.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,240
So, the first, it says PC here,

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,380
first principal component,
is the direction of maximum variance.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,310
Now a quick word of warning.

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,410
You see here, I've got this little
symbol here that indicates that's where

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,200
the mean of the points is.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,270
Principal components is mathematically
defined about the origin.

12
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,730
So what we typically do is we talk
about moving all of the points

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,650
to have their mean at the origin.

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,846
But then we forget that it's doing that,
we have to do it in the math and

15
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:51,115
we would draw something like this and
say you see this?

16
00:00:51,115 --> 00:00:56,245
This direction, that's the first
principle component of those points.

17
00:00:56,245 --> 00:00:58,335
It's the direction of maximum variance.

18
00:00:58,335 --> 00:01:00,322
They're not around the origin here so

19
00:01:00,322 --> 00:01:03,426
we have to shift it actually
before we do the computation but

20
00:01:03,426 --> 00:01:07,273
when we think about it we're only
talking about with respect to the mean,

21
00:01:07,273 --> 00:01:11,309
and the subsequent principle components
are perpendicular or orthogonal to

22
00:01:11,309 --> 00:01:15,000
the previous ones, and describe
a next greatest amount of variance.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,207
Now, in two dimensions,
we're sort of done, right?

24
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:19,917
So, we say, well, that's the first one.

25
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:23,890
Well, the next one's gotta be there,
because there's only two dimensions so

26
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,400
it's gotta go to that direction.

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,315
But if I was in three dimensions,
I would have my first dimension and

28
00:01:28,315 --> 00:01:31,846
then everything would be along there, so
I could remove that, collapse it down on

29
00:01:31,846 --> 00:01:35,324
a plane, let's say in that plane, what's
the maximum variation that will be my

30
00:01:35,324 --> 00:01:38,170
second one, and then I would have
the third one that will be left.
