Here's another quiz. If we standardize a distribution by converting every value

2
00:00:05,437 --> 00:00:10,865
to a z-score, what will be the new mean of this standardized distribution? This

3
00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:15,968
is a pretty difficult question, so if you get it, then you should definitely

4
00:00:15,968 --> 00:00:21,201
brag about it in the forums. As a hint, just think again about how we calculate

5
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:25,923
z-scores. Any value on the axis minus the mean divided by the standard

6
00:00:25,923 --> 00:00:30,825
deviation. And think also, in the previous videos, we showed how we take any

7
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:35,437
normal distribution and then we standardize it. So you might want to replay

8
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:40,073
those videos, if you don't know the answer right now, because those might help

9
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,681
you figure out what the new mean will be.
