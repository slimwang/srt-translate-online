1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,000
So we're about to run the newSaga function for a second time.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,250
And the important issue here is that we will create a brand new red context,

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,200
which will be the home for a new foil variable and two new blue contexts.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,724
The other interesting thing here is that the sagas array is going to now have

5
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:21,620
two different function objects in it as a result of the second call to .push.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,930
Let's examine the situation further by imagining that there were even more

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,960
calls to the two different saga functions here before the end of the program.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,670
Running the first saga function again should work just like it did

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,840
the other times we ran it even though we've created a second newSaga context.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,580
And as we can see as we run the code, running that inner sagas function creates

11
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:48,620
a new blue sagas context inside the first red newSaga context.

12
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,750
That's because we're running the first of those saga functions.

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,710
The first of the saga functions was created in the first of

14
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,410
the newSaga contexts.

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,360
What do you expect the output to be this time?
