1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,440
As you can see, we're getting pretty close to our mock up,

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,370
but the page looks a little bland.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,710
Of course, we don't have the right colors over here, and

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,700
it also looks like the text isn't formatted quite the same either.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,270
Notice how in the mock up we're right aligned, but

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,970
over here on our site right now we are on the left.

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,150
Also notice how this name and

8
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,380
title are both in all caps, while ours are capitalized normally.

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,670
Check out Bootstrap's documentation to see if there are any classes that'll help

10
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,700
you easily fix things like alignment and capitalization.

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,500
I recommend checking out the Typography section.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,298
This is a two-part question.

13
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:34,340
In the first part,

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,570
pick the classes that you need to right-align text and make text all uppercase.

15
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,380
For the second part of this question,

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,730
which of these elements need the classes that you've defined up here?

17
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,310
Div class equal row, div class equals column medium six,

18
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,290
or is it the h1 header and h3 header?

19
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,000
Check all that apply
