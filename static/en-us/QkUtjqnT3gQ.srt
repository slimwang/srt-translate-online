00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,028
In our app, we just finished using
what we call a black box for

2
00:00:03,028 --> 00:00:03,812
handling UI updates.

3
00:00:03,812 --> 00:00:07,302
We're going to continue to use that
code for the remainder of the course.

4
00:00:07,302 --> 00:00:10,860
I'm going to give you two choices, if
you want to continue the course without

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,796
knowing how the black box works,
then take this blue pill.

6
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:18,690
But if you want to see how deep the
rabbit hole goes, the black box goes,

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,110
then take this red pill.

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,020
The choice is yours.
