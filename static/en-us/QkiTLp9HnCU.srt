00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,450
Let's actually look at the whole
concept of aligning images, right.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,260
First thing I can do is if I have
a pair of images left and right,

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,200
I can just translate the image on top
of each other, find similar features.

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,730
Just showcased here as long
as I can do a decent job of

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,900
aligning some of these things,
I might be fine but will I really be?

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,540
I mean, again, the options that I may
have in this kind of relationship is

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,790
I may be able to put
a left image on top and

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,780
the right image on the bottom and
do a best possible alignment that way.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,350
Another option is I can put r, the right
image on top and the left on bottom and

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,850
you can see that now we can actually
start figuring out a little bit more

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,480
between these two images but in reality,
we need to be able to do a lot more.

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,000
In reality, what we need to do is be
able to kind of blend these images

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,290
together but before we do that,
we also have to warp the left and

14
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,580
right images and again,
this warp means now,

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,090
if you'll notice, is that the image
is no longer rectangular.

16
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,370
And, of course, what that basically
means is now we've been able to kind of

17
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:09,580
merge the regions that
similar across both images.

18
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,930
So warping, in this instance,
is a better solution and

19
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,960
again, now we know how
to do that kind of stuff
