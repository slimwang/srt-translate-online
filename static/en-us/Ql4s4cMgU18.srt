1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,090
Today we'll talk about Analogical Reasoning.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,010
Analogical Reasoning involves understanding new problems,

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,990
in terms of family of problems. It also involves addressing new problems, but

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,239
transferring knowledge of relationships from known problems across domains.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,320
We introduced a notion of transfer previously in explanation based learning.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,175
We also have talked about Case Based Reasoning.

7
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:26,420
Today we'll talk about transfer in a much more general manner.

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,860
We'll start by talking about similarity then revisit case based reasoning.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,780
Then we'll talk through the overall process of analogical reasoning,

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,970
including retrieval, and mapping, and transport. Then we'll close by

11
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,680
talking about a specific application of analogy, called Design by Analogy.
