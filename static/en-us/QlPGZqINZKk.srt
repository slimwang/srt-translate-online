00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,074
You can see here that the cost to make 92 wiper sets is equal to 598. But we

2
00:00:04,086 --> 00:00:08,306
also see in the last equation, that the cost to make 92 wiper sets is equal to

3
00:00:08,318 --> 00:00:12,452
the cost to make one wiper set times the number of wiper sets made. Now, when

4
00:00:12,464 --> 00:00:16,792
two quantities are both equal to the same thing, that means they're also equal

5
00:00:16,804 --> 00:00:21,138
to each other. That means we can say that 598 equals the cost to make one wiper

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,456
set times the number of wiper sets made. That's actually really just another

7
00:00:25,468 --> 00:00:29,477
case of substitution. So, we can put a 598 in this spot, and we're going to

8
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:33,969
continue to leave dollar signs out for now just for simplicity. You see the cost

9
00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:38,027
to make one wiper set, both here and the last equation, and also here that it's

10
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,816
equal to c. So, let's substitute c in and the number wiper sets made is 92. Now,

11
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:48,144
we have an equation. 598 equals c times 92. There's one slight adjustment that

12
00:00:48,156 --> 00:00:53,291
I'm going to make. I'm going to say that 598 equals 92c. So, remember that we

13
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:58,748
normally write the coefficients, just plain numbers, at the front of terms and

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,947
then the variables following them. So, look at that. After a lot of hard work,

15
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:09,515
we finally have a lovely, concise equation. 598 equals 92c. I'm going to put a

16
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,595
nice little box around that.
