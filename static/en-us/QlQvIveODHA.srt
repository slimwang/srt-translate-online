00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,295
Let's quickly check if we understood
the write-update optimizations.

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:09,760
Suppose that we have a system with two
cores that uses write-update coherence.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,310
Suppose that the two cores are executing
a program where core 0 writes something

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:20,320
to a memory address A, then core
1 reads it and this continues so

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,760
that the write and then a read pattern
repeats, for a total of 1,000 times.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,900
So this is the first of 1,000.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,200
After they do this for 1,000 times,
these cores go to do something else,

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,330
where core 0 replaces A and
then core 1 also replaces A.

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,490
The question for you is,

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:45,050
how many bus uses do we see when
the system uses no optimizations?

11
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,840
So there is no dirty bit and
no shared bit.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,900
When the system uses only
the dirty bit optimization, and

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,790
when the system uses both the dirty and
the shared bit optimization.

14
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,970
So for each of these,

15
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:02,290
how many bus uses do we get during
this whole time for block A?

16
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:07,320
And also, how many memory writes do
we get in each of these three cases?
