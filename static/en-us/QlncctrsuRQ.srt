1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,740
In lesson one we'll build an app
called sleeping in the library

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,220
that uses the flicker
API to retrieve and

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,510
display images of people
sleeping in the library.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,690
This will be our first exposure to a web
service, a core concept in this course.

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,840
To build this we're going to
learn all about networks.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,040
In lesson two we'll create flick finder
an app that uses the flicker API

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,610
to retrieve and

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,390
display images except this time you
can search with a phrase or location.

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,850
Here we'll learn how to parse
data from the network and

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,970
then display it to our users.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,760
Next in lesson three we'll build
the my favorite movies app,

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,500
by using the movie data base API.

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,770
In this lesson we'll learn
the difference between user and

14
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,900
anonymously access data.

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,040
Then, in lesson four,

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,610
we'll build on the app from lesson
three to create the movie manager.

17
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,715
This will require us to clean up
our networking code by using good

18
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:51,550
MVC design.

19
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,770
Then, in lesson five, we'll get started
on the course project called on the map.

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,630
This will let you showcase your
skills on the map with other

21
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,560
udacity students from around the world.

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,970
For instance, you can share a recent
blog post, your LinkedIn profile or

23
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,020
any of the projects that you've created.

24
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,750
So let's get started.
