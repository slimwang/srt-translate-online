00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,150
So, congratulations. You've built a web crawler. You've learned to

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,590
crawl. We're not quite at flying yet, but this is a

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,960
lot that you've learned in just three units. And by learning

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,560
about lists, we can build any other structure we want starting

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,350
from lists. And we'll see lots of other things that we

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,660
do in the next unit, as well as the units that

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,400
follow that. That use lists. We haven't quite finished building a

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,410
search engine. We have a way of getting a great start

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,630
towards our purpose, finding all these pages to crawl. What we

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,120
need in Unit Four is the way to get the content from

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,232
those pages, by starting from our seed page, and following the

12
00:00:35,232 --> 00:00:38,640
crawl web procedure that you wrote. And then we'll use that to

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,280
build an index, so we can respond to queries when someone's

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,480
doing a search for a particular term. The other thing we'll do

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,320
in Unit Four is, we'll learn more about how the Internet and

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,450
the web work. I'm here with Anna Patterson who's built a bunch

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,270
of search engines, including building the world's

18
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,940
largest index of the web. And now

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,200
works for Google. And we've just finished building a very simple web crawler. I

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,810
want Anna to tell us something about how things are different if you want to

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,534
build a web crawler that works with the scale that Google has to deal with.

22
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,080
>> So there's three main issues with scaling up

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,470
a web crawler. One is the normal politeness that

24
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,890
you need on the Web. The second one is

25
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,810
how you get a bunch of machines involved in crawling,

26
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,710
not just one. And the last issue is how to consume a lot of bandwidth so

27
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,700
that you keep the expensive resource busy. While

28
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,500
still being polite. So, on politeness, there's a line

29
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,220
in the robots.txt that each domain tells you

30
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,990
how often you can crawl that domain. There's a

31
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,480
number of problems with that, which is that

32
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,360
multiple domains can be hosted with a hosted service,

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,850
and they can be hosted even on one machine.

34
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,920
So even though you're being polite to one domain, you're

35
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,470
really actually really hurting a hosting service, or you're hurting

36
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,300
a machine. So you have to make plans in order

37
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,560
to not hit one machine or one domain too

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,180
hard. The next thing is, that if you crawl on

39
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,990
just one machine. It, the state is very good, and

40
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,160
it's really easy to keep the state of the crawl

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,080
on the one machine. But then it's hard to

42
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,030
make a very big search engine, because you get as

43
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,790
much as one machine will crawl. So of course in

44
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,950
practice, you crawl on thousands of machines. Now, if you're

45
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,720
going to obey politeness, that means that each of your

46
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,610
thousand machines, needs to tell the other ones, what it

47
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,650
has crawled and what it's about to crawl and what

48
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,260
it, going to crawl in 20 minutes, right? All of this

49
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,460
communication overhead can actually slow down the crawler,

50
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,100
which actually hurts your aim of having a

51
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,190
big search engine. The last part is that

52
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,250
you want to max out your bandwidth. So one thing

53
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,390
that people do instead of trying to lessen

54
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,690
the communication, is they pre-process the corpus that

55
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,750
they already have. So when you've crawled a

56
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,600
set of pages you can process them and extract

57
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,900
out all the links that they point to. You can then normalize those links so

58
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,060
that Yahoo.com and dubdubdub.yahoo.com wind up being the

59
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,700
same string, and now you can farm those

60
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,660
strings out to your thousand machines, and

61
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,940
now they don't have to communicate because they

62
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,800
know they're not going to hit the same domain.

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,790
However, they could accidentally hit the same hosting

64
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,790
service and the same machine, but you can

65
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,420
take care of that ahead of time as well.

66
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,130
>> Thanks a lot Anna. I hope those of you who think about unleashing

67
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,690
your web crawler on the world, pay

68
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,680
careful attention to what she said about politeness.

69
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,859
>> Thank you for having me, and students, good luck on your search engines.

70
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,020
>> So I hope we'll see you back

71
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,860
soon. You'll have a homework for Unit three that's

72
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,160
going to be quite challenging, and I look

73
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,930
forward to seeing all of your answers to it.
