00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,360
Can you find some interesting examples
of Impoverished Motion from the web?

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,380
Now these don't have to
be videos of dots moving,

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,290
they can be anything where you
have very little to go by, and yet

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,900
your brain reconstructs and
interprets the overall motion.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,540
Sometimes correctly, sometimes not.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,970
You can paste in links to web pages,
videos, or papers.
