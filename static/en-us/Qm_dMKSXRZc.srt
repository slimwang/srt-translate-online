Fortunately, for us, again, Grant tells us more information. He tells us that

2
00:00:04,806 --> 00:00:09,146
he's going to make 120 nozzles per day for the next month. Taking this

3
00:00:09,146 --> 00:00:13,971
information into account, can you figure out a value for x based on this data?

4
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:18,627
Remember, that x stands for the total number of nozzles made and I'd like to

5
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:20,938
know what x will equal after 1 month.
