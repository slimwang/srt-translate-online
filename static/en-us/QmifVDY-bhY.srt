00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,877
Remember that we're trying to get X by itself. So what's the next step that we

2
00:00:03,877 --> 00:00:07,871
should take to move towards that? Should we square both sides of our equation?

3
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:11,472
Should we find the positive square root of each side? Should we find the

4
00:00:11,472 --> 00:00:15,367
negative square root of each side? Or should we find both the positive and the

5
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:17,285
negative square roots of both sides?
