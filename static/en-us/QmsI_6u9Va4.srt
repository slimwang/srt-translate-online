1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So that probability is greater than 0.999,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and the reason for that is the only way she wouldn't be caught

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
is if the two people she spends the bill with

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
take exactly the same challenge.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The challenge is 10 bits long,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so the probability that would happen

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
is 1/2^10--1 in 1,024.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And 1 minus that is greater than 0.999.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's pretty high. If that's not good enough, we could increase m.
