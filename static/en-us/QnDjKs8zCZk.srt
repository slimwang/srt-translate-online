00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,737
We've seen how to make horizontal and vertical shifts happen for all sorts of

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:10,860
functions. And we've also seen how to reflect in the x and y axis. These types

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,700
of transformations are typically refererred to as rigid transformations,

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,210
because the basic shape of the graph doesn't change. All we're doing is

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,601
translating it around the coordinate plane. Or flipping it over. Only its

6
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:29,300
position changes. We can also, however, have nonrigid transformations. These

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,475
involve the stretching or shrinking of a function. Nonrigid transformations

8
00:00:33,475 --> 00:00:37,814
distort the shape of the original function. We're going to deal with this

9
00:00:37,814 --> 00:00:42,645
stretching and shrinking with something familiar right now. Parabolas. Here are

10
00:00:42,645 --> 00:00:46,260
a bunch of parabolas that have been stretched in different ways. I'd like you

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,030
to match each one with the equation it corresponds to. Please write the letter

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,240
of the parabola in the proper box.
