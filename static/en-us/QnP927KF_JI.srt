1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,180
Okay, so here is the code for class Parent

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,980
and now I will start to define class Child.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,110
Now, I know class Child inherits from class

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,550
Parent and the way to indicate that in

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:18,350
Python is to say this. The syntax here

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,180
means that class Child will now inherit or reuse

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,230
everything that is publicly available in class Parent.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,050
Now, things will get really interesting when we begin

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,360
to define the init method, or the constructor

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,020
for this class. So, we know that class Child

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,740
has three variables. Last name and eye color

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,960
that are inherited from class Parent. And this

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,000
other variable called number_of_toys. So, in addition to

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,820
the key word self, I will receive those values

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,890
as arguments right here in the init function;

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,530
there they are. Now, to initialize the variables I'm

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,097
inheriting from class Parent, variables like last_name and

18
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:59,600
eye_color, I will actually reuse class Parent's init method.

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,380
This is how we do it.

20
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,420
The last instance variable, number_of_toys, will be initialized next. Okay,

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,730
finally, I will add a print statement to the very beginning of the init method.

22
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,770
All right, now that we have defined our class Child, the next thing to do is

23
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,780
to create an instance of this class Child.

24
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,590
I will call it, appropriately enough, miley_cyrus. And here,

25
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,620
I will provide it the three necessary arguments.

26
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,860
And then, I will print out two things.

27
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,850
Her last name, and the number of toys.

28
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,690
Also, so I can focus on these print statements

29
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,590
in my output, I will comment out the previous instance

30
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,560
for now. There. Let me save this file. Now, before

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,780
I run this program, I want you to think about

32
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,520
what the output of this program will be. So, here

33
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,550
is the code one more time. Here is class Parent,

34
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,390
and here is class Child, and here, we are creating

35
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,580
an instance of class Child, and we named it miley_cyrus.

36
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,720
So, what do you think will be printed when I run

37
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,050
this piece of code? Enter your responses in this box.
