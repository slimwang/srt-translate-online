00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,880
Here's the answer,
log base 2 of n over L, let's see why.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,800
During the search, at some point
all the elements being considered

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,970
will all fall within
the same block of size L.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,070
Let's write down our currents for
the worst case behavior.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,060
While the size of the interval
n is greater than L,

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,130
you'd incur a new transfer and
then recurse.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,660
Once the interval size falls to L or

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,380
lower, you only need one transfer
to process the entire block.

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,080
The solution to this recurrence
is the answer to the problem.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,620
The more interesting question
is can you do better?
