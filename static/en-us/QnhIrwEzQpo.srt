00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,969
Let's try to implement a very simple approach for

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,960
matching corresponding regions from two image strips.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,020
First, recall the find best match problem.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,470
Given an image patch and

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:16,321
a strip, your task was to find the best x location for the patch in the strip.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,799
You are free to use this reference implementation or roll your own.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,285
Now, your task is to match two strips.

8
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:30,420
You're given the two strips, left and right, as well as a block size b.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,560
Note that you are only to consider whole, non-overlapping blocks.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,060
This means if your strip is 640 wide and the block size is 100,

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,160
then you only have six whole blocks.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,060
The last 40 columns of these strips are unused.

13
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,140
Return a vector of disparity values, one for each block.

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,655
All right.

15
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:51,800
Here's some code to test with.

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,520
We use the same pair of flower images as before and

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,490
extract a strip from each image.

18
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,640
The top one here is from the left image and the bottom one from the right.

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,230
Now we should be able to call your function by passing in the two strips and

20
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:09,920
the block size.
