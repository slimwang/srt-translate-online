I don't have to change very much. If I run the tester initially, it won't

2
00:00:04,018 --> 00:00:09,627
compile. Because right now, andahlSpeedup isn't a static method. And I can't

3
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:15,170
call non-static methods from the static main method. But if I go here and

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:20,240
declare this as public static double andahlSpeedup and public static double

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,664
crossRatio, and public static double average. Now, I can compile and run the

6
00:00:26,664 --> 00:00:29,980
tester method. Looks good.
