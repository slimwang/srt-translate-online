00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,736
Here's your third parabola. Where do you think this vertex is? And then try and

2
00:00:04,736 --> 00:00:08,718
create its graph. Now, you want to pay close attention when you go to complete

3
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:13,684
the square, since there's a negative 2 here. Also, think about the orientation

4
00:00:13,684 --> 00:00:18,359
of your parabola. Which way should it open? When you think you've got the graph

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,344
and the vertex into the vertex here. And then check your graph in the solution
