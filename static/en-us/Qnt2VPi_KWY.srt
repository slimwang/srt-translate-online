00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,120
Let's look at a solution
to our TLB size quiz.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,730
We have a cache that is 32 kB in
size and has a 64 B block size.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,150
We have a 4 kB page size.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,640
So the question is how many TLB entries
do we need to have a similar hit rate

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,280
and miss rate to our cache.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,700
Well, if the processor is just
accessing up to 32 kB of memory,

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,850
then our TLB needs to cover the same
amount of memory that the cache does,

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,450
and that means we need eight pages.

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,590
Now it looks like this
would be the best answer.

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,100
However, if the processor is not
accessing all of the data in each of

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:45,030
the pages, then we would need more pages
to cover the same amount of memory

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,020
because in the cache with
a 64 B block size, we

13
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,600
can fit 512 different blocks, and they
can be spread around the whole memory.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,250
In contrast,

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,320
with eight entries in the TLB, we can
only be accessing eight different pages,

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,850
while these 500 blocks theoretically
could be in 512 different pages.

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,728
So our TLB, in this case, needs to
have up to 512 different pages in

18
00:01:10,728 --> 00:01:14,830
order to have hits for
the same data that the cache does.

19
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,450
In reality,
the number of pages we need for

20
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,480
the same hit rate will be
somewhere in between these two.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,060
So this is the best answer.
