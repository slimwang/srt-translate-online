00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,642
Research in education differs from
research in other areas in a number of

2
00:00:03,642 --> 00:00:05,840
ways, so I'm going to talk
about two of them here.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,564
One of those ways is the difficulty we
have controlling all the variables at

4
00:00:09,564 --> 00:00:11,350
play in educational research.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,600
We have interactions amongst students,
amongst students and teachers,

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,250
amongst the classroom,
amongst the broader school culture, and

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,290
we can't control for
all of those things.

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,240
So one of our difficulties is
in understanding the full range

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,458
of different variables and
dynamics at play.

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,050
Another interesting thing in educational
research is that very often we're not

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,470
just interested in understanding
learning or understanding education.

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,290
I think most of us get into this
field because we want to improve it.

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,310
That we want to help
students learn better.

14
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,700
And so when you're sitting in
a classroom observing something and

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,090
you recognize a reason why a student's
having trouble learning some material,

16
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,630
it's very difficult not to intervene and

17
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,140
help them because that's
why we're doing this.

18
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,870
And yet, if our main goal
is to understand learning,

19
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,290
then we can't do that.

20
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,620
So for these reasons among others,
a field exists especially in educational

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,665
research, although it exists elsewhere
as well, called design-based research.

22
00:00:59,665 --> 00:01:03,050
Design-based research is the idea
of creating something, and

23
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,519
then using that something,
that tool, that protocol,

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,875
that behavior, as a probe into classroom
interaction, or the learning process.

25
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:14,285
What we do here is effectively
build a tool that would work,

26
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:16,025
if our theory of learning is accurate.

27
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:19,665
For example, if we're interested
in individualized feedback.

28
00:01:19,665 --> 00:01:22,415
If we believe that students learn
better from individualized feedback,

29
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,375
we would create a tool that uses
individualized feedback, or

30
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,655
gives students individualized feedback.

31
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:31,120
And then based on whether or not that
tool actually improves learning,

32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,280
we would reflect back
on our original theory.

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,920
If the tool gives students
individualized feedback and they don't

34
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,930
improve in their understanding of some
material, then we might reflect and

35
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,460
say that theory that I used to
justify that tool was actually false.

36
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,130
I don't have any evidence to defend
the idea that that's useful.

37
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,640
But then if that tool actually
does work, we would say,

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,780
because I developed a tool that
improved individualized feedback and

39
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,660
because students learned as a result,

40
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,488
my theory about individualized feedback
helping learning must be accurate.

41
00:01:56,488 --> 00:02:00,420
So in designed-based research, we're
designing tools, then using those tools

42
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,110
as probes into the phenomenon that
those tools are designed to address.
