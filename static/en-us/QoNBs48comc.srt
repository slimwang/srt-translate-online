1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,378
All right, it's your turn.

2
00:00:02,378 --> 00:00:05,100
Implement a CursorLoader
in the forecast fragment

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,390
to load the cursor used
in the cursor adapter.

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,020
You want to pass zero in for the flags
when you create the cursor adapter as

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,270
the loader will now be responsible for
re-querying when data changes.

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,050
Also, it's easiest to
have ForcastFragment

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,060
implement the Loader Callbacks.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,495
If after you're doing all of this,

9
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:26,440
your app still displays the weather,
you've probably done it right.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,990
Make sure to check that you are using
the support library versions of all of

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,320
our classes.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,210
Otherwise, you won't get
Android 2.3 compatibility.

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,260
I've provided the exact import
statements you need to use

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,750
in the instructor notes below.
