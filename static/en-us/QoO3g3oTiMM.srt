1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,500
>> So we can actually work out what the VC

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,540
dimension of a finite H is and, in fact, it's easier

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,120
to just think about it in terms of an upper

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,300
bound. So, let's, let's imagine that the VC dimension of H

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,020
is some number, D. And the thing to realize from

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,870
that, is that, that implies that there has to be at

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,270
least two to the d distinct concepts. Why is that? Is

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,360
because each of the two to the d different labelings is

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,530
going to be captured by a distinct hypothesis in the class, because

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,280
if we can't use the same hypothesis to get two different labelings. So

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,260
that means that the, that two to the d is going to be less

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,860
than or equal to the number of hypotheses. It could be that there's

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,370
more, but there can't be any fewer, otherwise we wouldn't be able

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,950
to get things shattered. So, just you know, simple manipulation here, gives us

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,000
that d is less than or equal to the log base 2 of

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,425
h, so there is this logarithmic relationship, between the size of a finite

17
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,815
hyptothesis class. And the VC dimension of it,

18
00:00:52,815 --> 00:00:54,880
and again, that's what we were seeing in

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,656
the other direction as well, that the, that the log of the hypo, size of the

20
00:00:58,656 --> 00:01:00,898
hypothesis space was kind of playing the role

21
00:01:00,898 --> 00:01:03,370
of the VC dimension in, in the bound.

22
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,950
Okay, that makes sense. And, and from that,

23
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,270
it's easy to see how 13 got in there.

24
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,580
>> Yes. It should be pretty much obvious

25
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,170
to even the most casual observer of 13.

26
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,990
>> Yes, I think that's right. So I don't

27
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,530
think there's any reason for us to explain it.

28
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,750
>> Yeah, I think one would have to really go back and look at the, at the

29
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,190
proof to get the details of why the, it has the form that it has, but, or at

30
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,670
least the details of the form. The, the, the,

31
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,560
overall structure of the form, I think we understand.

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,080
It's just that the details come out of the

33
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,200
proof and we're not going to go through the proof.

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,970
>> And I think that's probably best for everyone.

35
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,230
>> So what, what we're seeing at the moment is that

36
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,630
a finite hypothesis class or a finite VC dimension, give us finite

37
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,200
bounds, and therefore make things PAC-learnable. What's kind of amazing though

38
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,615
is that there's a general theorem that says, in general, if H is

39
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:55,870
PAC-learnable if and only if the VC dimension is finite. So

40
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,720
that means that, we know that anything that

41
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,160
has finite VC dimension is learnable from the previous

42
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,070
bound. But we're saying that it's actually the other

43
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,650
way as well, that if something is learnable it

44
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,490
has finite VC dimension. Or to say it another

45
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,758
way, if it has infinite VC dimension, you can't

46
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:16,690
learn it. VC dimension captures, in one quantity, the

47
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,430
notion of PAC-learnability, which is, which is really beautiful.

48
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,950
>> Yeah, I agree. That V and that C guy, they're pretty smart.
