Hi, everybody. Welcome back. We're in unit 7, which is the last unit of our class.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this unit, we're not going to cover any new material,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and there's no quizzes or homework that count for anything.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Instead, I want to accomplish two things.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
My main goal for this unit is to remind you of what we learned

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and to put it into a broader context.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I've asked some colleagues to help me out by sharing some of their experience with us over Skype.
