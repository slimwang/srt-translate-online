1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,110
Let's review how to import and
run a libgdx project.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,800
Open up Android Studio and

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,100
close any open projects until
you get to this splash screen.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,570
On the Quick Start pane
select Import Project.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,870
If you click on this button,
second from the left,

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,670
you'll jump straight to your desktop.

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,340
There, hopefully you can
find the ud406 folder.

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,366
If not, go ahead and
press these blue circle arrows, and

9
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:24,395
that should refresh the file picker.

10
00:00:24,395 --> 00:00:28,605
The folder you want is
2.1.01-Demo-importAndRunAProject.

11
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:29,105
And hit OK.

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,630
Now that the project is imported,
let's get it fired up.

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,575
The easiest way to run the desktop
version is to open the terminal down at

14
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:39,565
the bottom left of Android Studio.

15
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:45,745
And then execute the command
gradlew desktop run.

16
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,205
There we go,
it looks like everything's working.

17
00:00:48,205 --> 00:00:51,593
Instead of using the terminal, we can
also set up a run configuration so

18
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,810
that we can use the Ctrl+R
shortcut to run the game.

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,519
To do that, we can go to this
run configuration drop down,

20
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:03,830
select Edit Configurations,
hit the plus button, select Gradle.

21
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,160
We'll call this new run
configuration Desktop.

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,960
We'll hit this button, and
select the root project.

23
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,860
And then for
tasks we'll say desktop run.

24
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,880
Then if we just hit Ctrl+R or
hit the green arrow, we'll run the app.

25
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,220
Unfortunately, you'll have to do this
with every project you import as these

26
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,870
run configurations are stored in
the same place as user specific stuff,

27
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,690
like the theme you use, which doesn't
make sense to check into Git.

28
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,740
Finally, to run the Android version, you
can just switch the run configuration

29
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,660
back to Android, and
hit the screen button, or hit Ctrl+R.

30
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,020
Hopefully, all these steps are familiar
to you from a previous course.

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,580
But you might want to run through them
again just to refresh your memory.
