1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,660
In order to rationalize this denominator, we want our powers of 2, x and y to

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,243
be divisible by 3. This means, we'll going to to have 2 cubed, x to the 6th,

3
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:13,901
and y to the 9th. We need to up these powers, so that way they're divisible by

4
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:18,558
3. So, to change 2 to the 1 to 2 to the 3, we multiply by a cube root of 2

5
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:23,755
squared. This means, we have to multiply by the cube root of 2 squared x to the

6
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:29,850
1 y squared. This is so that way the powers sum to multiples of 3. We'll 2 to

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,373
the 1 and 2 squared, which is 2 to the 3rd. x to the 5th and x to the 1, which

8
00:00:33,373 --> 00:00:39,664
is x to the 6th. And y to the 7th times y squared, which y to the 9th. Since we

9
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,992
multiply a denominator by this expression, we multiply our numerator by the

10
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:47,538
same expression. Now, we want to simplify. Our numerator stays the same, since

11
00:00:47,538 --> 00:00:52,200
we can't pull out any of these factors, since they don't appear three times.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,302
This denominator simplifies to 2 x squared and y to the 3rd. Remember, we're

13
00:00:58,302 --> 00:01:02,945
just applying power divided by root to get each of these powers. And we can

14
00:01:02,945 --> 00:01:08,577
actually simplify further. The 6 and the 2 reduce to 3 divided by 1. And this

15
00:01:08,577 --> 00:01:12,976
power of x reduces with 1 of the powers in the denominator. In other words,

16
00:01:12,976 --> 00:01:15,726
we'll have 1 more power of x in the denominator, than we would in our

17
00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:20,380
numerator. This leaves us with our simplified answer. Now, the hardest part to

18
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,108
this problem is understanding what to multiply by here. I think if you start by

19
00:01:24,108 --> 00:01:27,321
figuring out what your denominator should look like, you'll get there more

20
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,753
quickly.
