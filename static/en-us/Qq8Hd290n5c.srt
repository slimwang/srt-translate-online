00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
For the next few questions we're given this data structure of courses.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's take a couple seconds to go through what it looks like.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,500
It's a dictionary where each key in the dictionary is a hexamester of courses that Udacity offers.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,000
In each hexamester we have another dictionary

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
that's where the keys are the name of the course,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and within that there's another dictionary with name value pairs.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is a common way to store data in an unstructured form

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
where we just have an attribute like name, teacher, assistant, whatever--

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
prereq down here--and then a value for that attribute:

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Building a Search Engine, the name of the TA, etc, etc.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This question asks us to write a function

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
that determines whether a course is offered during a given hexamester,

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and we're going to do that pretty simply.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Before we get started, let's look at the data structure.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What we want to do is, given a hexamester and the name of a course,

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
we want to determine if that course is a key in the dictionary

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to which that hexamester is associated with.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And this is just 1 line of code, actually.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What this line of code does is determine whether or not the course is a key

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
in the dictionary that we get with the keyword hexamester in our course's data structure.
