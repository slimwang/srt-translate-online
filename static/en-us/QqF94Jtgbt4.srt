1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,100
So I'm here with Cameron Pittman, who
is a course developer here at Udacity.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,000
He's going to talk to us
a little bit about metacognition.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,170
So thank you for talking to us today.

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,160
>> Yeah, happy to be here.

5
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,530
>> So the first thing I want to ask is,

6
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,300
the reason why I'm talking to Cameron
about metacognition is that Udacity has

7
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,950
started a new type of
debate class they call R&R.

8
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,010
And can you tell us a little
bit about what that is?

9
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,040
>> Sure, R&R is not a replacement for
the classroom.

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,350
It's just another way
to engage students.

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,600
Our classes are essentially a series of,
as you guys probably well know, videos,

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:32,460
questions, problems, projects,
and some short readings.

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,205
And that's actually where we're
extending the classroom here with R&R.

14
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:38,730
R&R is actually, I think it stands for
reading and reflection.

15
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,480
It's essentially a set of
topics online or blog posts or

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,090
news articles or any kind of writings
online that are relevant to the course.

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,140
And what we simply do is ask
students to read them and

18
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,770
then reflect in the forums.

19
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,830
It's just another way of
trying to engage students and

20
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,530
introducing them to material
that's out in the world.

21
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,490
>> So it's worth noting that when they
started the R&R way of doing classes

22
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,510
here at Udacity I didn't know about it.

23
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,940
And they did it in parallel
to me designing this class.

24
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,880
And so this R&R approach is very
much what we do in this class where

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,540
it's all about readings and going out
and finding your own resources and

26
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,330
reflecting on them and
sharing them with classmates.

27
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,780
But something I'd ask for both these
students in this class as well as for

28
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,300
general understanding of the way this
is used, is this for everybody, or

29
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,950
is this a kind of approach
that's specifically for

30
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,090
people who don't learn
from traditional methods,

31
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,420
that don't like to learn from lectures,
that they need an alternate way?

32
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,780
Or is this the better way to learn for
everybody?

33
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,800
>> I would never couch something
as a better way to learn for

34
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,940
everybody because everybody
learns differently.

35
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,930
There are different modes of learning.

36
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,670
Some people learn better visually,
auditorially, or in-discussionally.

37
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,685
Okay, that's not a word.

38
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,750
>> [LAUGH]
>> But anyways, so this is just another

39
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,950
way of introducing students to material,
that they wouldn't normally see.

40
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,890
And I think this is a great method,
because as a developer, which is what

41
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,480
we're training people to become, you
have to be up to date with current news.

42
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,335
You have to be up to date with the
current thoughts on whatever technology

43
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:00,610
it is you're working with.

44
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,880
And R&R is just a great
way to reflect that.

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,920
So, its not replacing anything and

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,055
I don't think its necessarily
a better way to learn.

47
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:11,330
It's just another way of introducing
students to the world around them.

48
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,550
I like it a lot because it doesn't
just teach you the content

49
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,350
that you're learning about.

50
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,650
It doesn't teach you how to design
a form or how to write a line of code.

51
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,203
But it also teaches you that in the
future when you encounter a problem that

52
00:02:21,203 --> 00:02:23,400
you don't know how to solve,
how would you go out and solve it?

53
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,800
And that's almost more important.

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,320
It's one thing to teach
someone something but

55
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,220
it's something else to teach them
how to solve their future problems.

56
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,640
>> And not to mention it also introduces
students to developer communities.

57
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,480
You start meeting other people or seeing
other people who are interested in

58
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,310
the same technologies and it gives
students a chance to get involved.

59
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,120
>> Yeah, absolutely.

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,540
So since this is an Ed Tech class
though, one question I would have is,

61
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,630
is technology, aside from us being in
computer science, so let's imagine for

62
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,480
a second we're doing R&R
in an English class or

63
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,380
something like that, how does
technology actually help with this?

64
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,440
Is it a core part of the R&R process, or
is it just that, because we're teaching

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,030
computer science here at Udacity we
tend to use technology along with this.

66
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,352
>> Well, I think technology in this case
is just a better way to do paperwork.

67
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:02,864
[LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH]

68
00:03:02,864 --> 00:03:03,437
>> You know,

69
00:03:03,437 --> 00:03:05,860
you could easily do this in the class.

70
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,440
Millions of teachers probably have.

71
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,620
You assign a reading to your students,
you get them to read.

72
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,100
And that's essentially
all we're doing here.

73
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,990
And technology just makes it easier.

74
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,340
It's not necessarily better or worse,

75
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,030
it's just easier and
more accessible to students.

76
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,124
>> Yeah, it sounds like it introduces
a more rapid feedback cycle because

77
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:23,858
instead of having to go to the library,
find an encyclopedia,

78
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:26,384
read about it, go home and
realize I read the wrong thing,

79
00:03:26,384 --> 00:03:28,880
I can go through that cycle in
a minute instead of in a day.

80
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,805
So it really lets them go
through that more often.

81
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:33,910
So if we have any students in the class
who want to apply an approach like this,

82
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,760
an R&R style approach, or an approach
that really fosters metacognition in

83
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,630
their project that they develop for this
class, do you have any suggestions for

84
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,630
what they should think about
while they're doing it?

85
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,880
>> Yeah, sure.

86
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,590
So one of the nice things about R&R is
it lets students go at their own pace,

87
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,000
and gives them control over
what they're learning, and

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,280
then what they do with
what they're learning.

89
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,280
Because they're simply reflecting on it,
and maybe they hate the article,

90
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,700
maybe they love the article, maybe they
want to share it, maybe they don't.

91
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,426
But either way they have
the power to do all these things.

92
00:03:57,426 --> 00:04:01,150
And that actually is a huge part of
learning is having the power to control

93
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,350
what you're learning and
how you're learning and

94
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,090
what you're going to do
with what you've learned.

95
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,840
And so any kind of tool that gives
students that kind of power is

96
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,230
obviously a good way to go.

97
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,320
>> Great.
Well, thank you so much for

98
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,870
talking to us.

99
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,530
>> Yeah.
Happy to be here.
