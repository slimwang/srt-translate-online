1
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,130
So this is your final project for the class.

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,180
And judging by the looks of it, your resume should be just about done.

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,350
Great job.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,970
But, before we can let you off the hook,

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,450
remember that we've learned quite a bit about objects and

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,280
the way that they can encapsulate information and related functions.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,790
This is a two-part final project.

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,930
In the first part, take the display functions that you wrote and

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:31,780
encapsulate them within their respective display, work and education objects.

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,970
>> The second part of this project is to make the page your own.

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,950
You can add whatever you want to show how truly awesome you are.

12
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,900
In the Instructor's Notes, we've added links to a couple of

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,120
cool JavaScript libraries to do interactive graphics and charts.

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,040
>> Right.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,140
There are thousands of awesome JavaScript libraries out there, and

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,700
most of them are really simple to include in your project.

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,633
Go the extra mile, and

18
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:57,690
make your project really stand out by taking advantage of any one of them.

19
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,327
Good luck.
