1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,234
Recall from an earlier lesson that one

2
00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:04,970
of the internet's fundamental design tenants is packet

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,910
switching. In a packet switch network, resources are

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,340
not reserved and packets are self containment. Every

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,370
packet has a destination IP address, and each

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,810
packet travels independently to the destination host. In

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,010
a packet switch network, a link may be

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,140
shared by multiple senders at any given time,

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,210
using statistical multiplexing as we learned in previous

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,690
lessons. Well packet switch networks have their advantages, in

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,430
particular it makes it easy to achieve high utilization

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,960
on a shared link, packet switch networks also have

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,620
the drawback that A large number of senders can

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,580
overload a network resource, such as a node or

15
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,640
a link. Note that circuit switch networks like the

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,410
phone network do not have this problem because every

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:55,840
connection effectively has allocated, dedicated resources.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,530
For that particular connection until it

19
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,380
is terminated. So this problem that an attacker who sends allot of traffic

20
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,519
might exhaust resources is unique to

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,600
a packet switched network environment. So packet

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,220
switched networks are extremely vulnerable to

23
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,740
resource exhaustion attacks. Resource exhaustion Attacks a

24
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,530
basic component of security known as availability.

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,320
Let's take a look at other component of

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,920
security as well. In addition to Availability, we

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,740
would like the network to provide Confidentiality. For

28
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,080
example, if you're performing a sensitive banking transaction

29
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,050
or having a private conversation. With a friend.

30
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,740
You'd like the Internet to provide some level

31
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,640
of confidentiality. Another component of security is Authenticity.

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,600
Authenticity ensures the identity of the origin of

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,050
a piece of information. So, for example, if you're

34
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,770
reading a particular news article, you really may want

35
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,980
to know that the article came From the New

36
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,150
York Times website. As oppose to, from some other

37
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,030
place on the internet. Similarly, you might want to

38
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,120
know that, that information wasn't modified in flight. That

39
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,020
property is called Integrity. Which prevents unauthorized changes to

40
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,300
information as it traverses the network Now a security threat is

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,220
anything that might potentially cause a violation of one of these

42
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,330
properties. An attack, on the other hand, is an action that results

43
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,490
in the violation of one of these security

44
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,610
properties. So the difference between a threat and an

45
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,030
attack, is simply the difference between a violation

46
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,560
that could potentially occur. Versus an action that actually

47
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,230
results in a violation. Lets look at a couple example attacks on

48
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,780
different components of security. Lets start

49
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,000
by looking at an attack on Confidentiality.
