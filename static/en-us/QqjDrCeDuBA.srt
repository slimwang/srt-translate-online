00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,980
Now let's go back to the two pathways activated during stress response. The

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:09,420
second pathway that's responsible for our stress response, is the hypothalamus

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:16,070
pituitary adrenal axis, or HPA access, for short. When we're experiencing our

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,900
stressful emotional response to a stressor our hypothalamus releases something

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:27,075
called the corticotropin releasing factor or CRF for short. Then like a domino

6
00:00:27,075 --> 00:00:31,974
effect, this causes the pitutary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone,

7
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:38,265
ACTH for short, which then causes the adrenal gland to secrete cortisol.

8
00:00:38,265 --> 00:00:43,500
Cortisol is a major gluccocorticoid produced in humans. Which is commonly

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,326
called the stress hormone. This secretes from hypothalamus to pituitary gland

10
00:00:49,326 --> 00:00:55,605
to adrenal gland is why it's called the HPA axis, H P A.
