00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,370
So far we've covered these two steps,
and now we're going to look at providing

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,280
alternate translations
in another language.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,940
So in Android Studio there's
actually a neat little tool

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,380
called the translations editor.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,880
You can access it by clicking
on open editor, or you can

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,480
right click on the strings.xml file and
then click on open translations editor.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,190
There's a column for
the name of the string resource and

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,250
then the default value, which is
the English translation right now.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,705
Each row corresponds to another string
resource that we defined in our

10
00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:31,770
strings.xml file.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,190
If we click on the globe icon
here we can add a new language.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,700
I'm going to type Spanish and
add Spanish.

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,380
You can click on the cell here to
provide the Spanish translation for

14
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,760
the string resource, thank you.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,080
I'm going to type in gracias,
which means thank you,

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,960
in my terrible Spanish accent.

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,180
We can do the same for
our toppings header and

18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,040
this is the Spanish translation.

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,210
I'm not even going to
try to pronounce that.

20
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,690
Now let's rebuild our app.

21
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,290
My device still has Spanish as a default
language, and when I open up our app,

22
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,080
now I see that the toppings
header is translated in Spanish.

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,150
The rest is still in English
because I haven't finished it yet.

24
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,070
And then when I click on the order
button, then I see gracias.
