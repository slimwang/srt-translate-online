1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,010
As I hinted at in the last lesson, your boss really likes cats.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,720
They want even more cats.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,690
In fact, they want Cat Clicker Premium.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,560
Now obviously, you'll run out of screen space if you add too many more,

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,200
so your boss wants you to build a list of cats on the side.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,812
And when you choose a cat from that list, the cat is displayed in the cat area.

7
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,350
That will mean quite a few changes to your application.

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,860
You'll need to find a way to build a list of cats.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,020
You'll need to add selection functionality to the list.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,910
You'll need to display the correct cat when the list items are clicked, and

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,920
of course, you'll need to keep each cat's number separate and accurate.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,760
I'll provide you with an official spec sheet for

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,600
the new application in a second.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,830
And my advice to you is the same.

15
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,730
Try not to repeat yourself, and make sure that you choose some cute pictures of

16
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,690
cats so they can comfort and console you if you feel frustrated.

17
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,290
After this step, we'll go over the code together and

18
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,640
we'll start talking about some useful organizational techniques for

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,150
resolving some of the problems you're likely running into.
