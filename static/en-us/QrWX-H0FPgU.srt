00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:06,210
It turns out that content distribution networks and ISPs have a fairly symbiotic

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:12,950
relationship when it comes to peering relationships. CDNs like to peer with ISPs

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,680
because peering directly with ISPs, where

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,650
a customer's located, provides better throughput. Since

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,180
there are no intermediate AS hops. And network latency is lower. Having more

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,830
vectors to deliver a content increases reliability.

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,310
And during large request events, having direct

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,620
connectivity to multiple networks where the content

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,710
is hosted allows an ISP to spread its

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,534
traffic. Across multiple transit links. Thereby potentially

11
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:45,281
reducing the 95th percentile and lowering its

12
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:50,020
transit costs. On the other hand, there are other good reasons for ISPs to peer

13
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,200
with CDNs. First of all, providing content

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,750
closer to the ISP's customers allows the ISP

15
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,800
to provide the customers with good performance for

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,400
a particular service. For example. You could already

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,584
see that Georgia Tech has placed a

18
00:01:05,584 --> 00:01:08,830
Google cache node, in its own network. Resulting

19
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,587
in very low latencies to Google. And thereby

20
00:01:11,587 --> 00:01:15,129
happy customers. You can imagine that providing good

21
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:18,096
performance to popular services is a major selling

22
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:21,730
point for ISPs. Another reason that ISPs like to

23
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,860
peer with CDNs or host cache nodes locally

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,840
is to lower their transit costs. You can imagine.

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,670
That if there are a huge demand for

26
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,640
a particular video on YouTube and all the requests

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,670
and responses were going over expensive transit links,

28
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,560
then the ISPs cost would be potentially prohibitively high.

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,111
On the other hand peering with the CDN, or hosting a local cache

30
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:46,121
node, prevents all of that traffic

31
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:49,450
from traversing expensive links, thus reducing costs.
