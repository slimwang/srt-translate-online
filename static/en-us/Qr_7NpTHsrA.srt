[Wes:] Welcome to Programming Languages. I'm Wes Weimer.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Together we're going to learn the theory and practice of programming languages,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
culminating in the construction of a web browser.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Our web browser will accept as input HTML and JavaScript, the primary languages of the web,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and use that to produce an image of the web page.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You may already be familiar with HTML, which describes the basics of web pages.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We'll certainly go over it in this course later on, but you may be a less familiar with JavaScript,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which allows one to describe computations that take place on web pages.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This gives us a lot of power and also a lot of flashy graphics.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's see some examples.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This particular webpage, chosen more or less at random,

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
uses JavaScript to animate these tabs for its title bar at the top.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is a second example of a webpage that uses JavaScript,

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
both here at the top for this sort of floating tool tip,

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
but also down here at the bottom to animate the differences between these textual boxes.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If we look at the source for one of these webpages,

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
we can see that it contains both HTML and JavaScript right from the start.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let me give you a brief overview, in pictures more or less,

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
of how this course and the overarching project will go.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We start with the source to a webpage, which is in HTML and JavaScript.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Our next main step is to break that source into important words,

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
just like we could break and English sentence into important words.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Then we'll understand the structure of the words that we found.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
For example, focusing on this part down here, it may be easier to understand 1 plus 2 plus 3

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
as a tree, showing all of the computations.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Then finally we'll figure out the meaning of that structure.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
For example, in this case maybe all of that adds up to 6,

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and that's what we'll display in our resulting webpage.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Building a web browser will be a lot of fun, but the overall goal of this course is not

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
actually to build a production quality browser,

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
but instead to use the goal of building a browser as a way

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
of structuring our exploration of computer science.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,738
Let's get started right here in step 1.
