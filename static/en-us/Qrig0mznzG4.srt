1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
An algorithm that has traditionally been called uniform-cost search

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but could be called cheapest-first search,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
is guaranteed to find the path with the cheapest total cost.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's see how it works.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We start out as before in the start state.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And we pop that empty path off.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Move it from the frontier to explored,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and then add in the paths out of that state.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
As before, there will be 3 of those paths.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And now, which path are we going to pick next

11
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in order to expand according to the rules of cheapest first?
