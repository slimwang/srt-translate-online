00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I think the best answer is really to search the web.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Buying a book, well that takes a lot of time, that cost money.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It might eventually help us but we're not patient enough, at least most computer sciences

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
aren't patient enough to wait for a book to arrive.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Phoning a friend might be a good thing to do and probably a good idea to call your mother,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
but that's not probably not what's going to help you to make union and if you phone your friends

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
through our programmers and keep asking them how to solve all your programming problems,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
they might not be your friends for much longer.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Reading a Python documentation could definitely help, but you'll have to know where to start

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and you'll have to read a lot before you got to something helpful.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Search engines are your friend.
