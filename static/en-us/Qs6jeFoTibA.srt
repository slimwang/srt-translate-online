00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,307
So, since we know that we are trying to write an equation and not just an

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:06,996
expression,I am going to start off by writing a equals in our box down here. So,

3
00:00:07,084 --> 00:00:10,608
since I know that the left side of the equation is not going to change at all.

4
00:00:10,696 --> 00:00:14,322
Then I can start to combine my like terms. Conveniently, our terms with w are

5
00:00:14,334 --> 00:00:18,330
already written next to each other and our terms with n. It was so nice that we

6
00:00:18,342 --> 00:00:22,905
did that for ourselves earlier. This is pretty straightforward then. Since these

7
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:26,920
are like terms, I can just add their coefficients. 36 plus 51 is 87. And I

8
00:00:26,932 --> 00:00:31,150
multiply that by the variable w. 22 plus 50 is 72. And that gets multiplied by

9
00:00:31,162 --> 00:00:32,894
the variable as well. Awesome.

10
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:36,980
We're one step closer to helping Grant figure out how much money he's going to

11
00:00:36,992 --> 00:00:38,762
have after these first two batches of friends pay him.
