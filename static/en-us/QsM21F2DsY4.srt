00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,290
Welcome to the third course in CS

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,280
6250, where we will be discussing network operations

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,180
and management. This segment in the course has

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,775
three lessons. The first lesson is focused on

5
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:16,160
software-defined networking, and its role in making

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,390
network operations and management easier. The second module

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,600
covers traffic engineering, which is the process by

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,160
which network operators reconfigure the network to balance

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,010
traffic demands across the network. The third lesson covers

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,780
network security. We will start with a lesson on

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,550
Software Defined Networking. But before we jump into the

12
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,130
details, I'd like to motivate a little bit why.

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,750
In particular I plan to tell you about the

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,220
role of network operators in running the network. So

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,720
what is network management? Network management is the process

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,710
of configuring the network to achieve a variety of tasks.

17
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,710
Network configuration achieves a variety of

18
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,840
tasks including balancing traffic load across the

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,220
network, achieving various security goals, and

20
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,260
satisfying business relationships that may exist between

21
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,427
the network that's being configured. And

22
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:08,330
neighboring networks such as the network's upstream

23
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,480
Internet service provider. A key aspect

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,050
to network management is configuring the network.

25
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:20,180
Unfortunately, if the network is not configured correctly, many

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,460
things can go wrong. Configuration mistakes can lead to problems,

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,330
such as persistent oscillation, whereby, routers can't agree on a

28
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,120
route to a destination. Loops, where packets get stuck in between two or more

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,590
routers and never actually make it to

30
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,670
the destination. Partitions, where by the network is

31
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,540
split into two or more segments that are not connected,

32
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,910
and black holes where packets reach a router that does

33
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,680
not know what to do with the packet and drops

34
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,380
it, as opposed to sending on to it's ultimate destination.
