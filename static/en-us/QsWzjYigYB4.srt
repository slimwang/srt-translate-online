1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,640
To determine the correlation coefficient, we're just going to run

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,290
our cor.test function. We'll pass at our two variables,

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,430
www likes received, and likes received. This gives us

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,700
a correlation of .948. This is a strong positive

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,110
correlation, and in reality most variables are not correlated

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,350
that closely. The correlation that we just found was

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,880
an artifact of the nature of the variables. One

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,140
of them was really a super set of the other.
