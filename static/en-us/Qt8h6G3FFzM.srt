1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, here's my solution.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I define deal. It takes the number of hands and the number of cards in each hand.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And then I've also added in an optional parameter

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
to make the function a little bit more general.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Here I built up a normal poker deck

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
with the 13 different ranks and 4 different suits.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I have a list comprehension that goes over both of them

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and makes a 52-card deck.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But I provide that as a parameter because you might want to

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
deal different types of decks.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In other games like pinochle, you have a different number of cards.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I just want to make deal a little bit more general, so I provide that

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
as an optional parameter.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Then I randomly shuffle the deck,

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and if you looked up in the random module, you see there is a function called shuffle.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's the one you want.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And then I go through, and for the number of hands

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I take a slice out of the deck which has been shuffled

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and accumulate that into the result list.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now, let's look a little bit more carefully at exactly

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
what this expression here means, pulling out this slice.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I've got a deck of cards which have been shuffled,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
so they're not in any particular order.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Say the 3 of clubs is first, and then the 7 of spades, and so on.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And now I want to pull out this slice out of the deck,

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
which is defined as the deck starting at n x i

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and going up to n x (i + 1).

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And we'll assume for now that n = 5.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
When i = 0, then this will go from 0 to 5.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And we'll pull out the first 5 cards, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That slice will be the first element that we'll pull out.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now when i is equal to 1, we're dealing to the second player,

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and 5 x 1 is 5, 5 x 1 + 1 is 10,

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and we'll pull out the next 5 cards.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We'll keep on going until we get numhands different cards and return them in a list.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Now let's just make sure this works.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's print, and let's just deal out 2 hands.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And there we see we get 2 hands back.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
There are 2 total hands, and each of them has 5 cards.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If we wanted to, we could deal different numbers of cards,

42
00:02:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so here we deal 2 hands, and they each have 7 cards.
