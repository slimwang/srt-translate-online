1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,330
So if you're going to go into
the world of paid advertising,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,130
that's a huge world and
there's so much to learn there.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,910
And if you're on a budget, the key is
always targeting, targeting, targeting.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,510
So you need to figure out
who your best user is.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,440
So if you're selling a software for
businesses what kind of business is it?

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,480
How big are they?

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,110
How many employees do they have?

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,020
In what vertical do they operate?

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,480
Who's going to be that exact
science that's going to

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,635
make the most out of
what I'm offering them?

11
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:32,215
And you want to target those guys
because you can't afford to spend

12
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:33,725
money broadly.

13
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:38,565
And once you have it,
try it with a little bit just spend

14
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:41,955
a little bit of money and see what you
get and optimize, optimize, optimize.

15
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:45,735
And then you'll potentially be
able to get some clients that

16
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:46,985
will use your product.

17
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:52,130
When you do paid advertising what
you really want to do is experiment,

18
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,700
experiment, experiments.

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,590
If you have 1,000 bucks, you want to
run 100 experiments for $10 each.

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,620
Try different language,

21
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,040
try different imagery,
try different types of targeting.

22
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,550
What you really want to do with that
kind of budget is not get as many users

23
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:12,220
as possible, it's just learn, learn
what works, learn what are the words?

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,070
What are the things that
will get people to sign up?

25
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,100
And out of those 100 experiments you
will see the one that works better and

26
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,661
later on when you have budget
you'll know how to spend it.

27
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:23,610
So platforms that will work well for

28
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,620
low budgets is an ever evolving thing,
right?

29
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,020
because new platforms keep coming up.

30
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,560
And you kind of have to find the right
platform that's right for your product.

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,220
But I think marketers have to keep their
eyes and ears open for what's the up and

32
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,860
coming platform, and
usually platforms that are new and

33
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,390
that have just opened up.

34
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,080
A couple of years ago YouTube,

35
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,380
I don't know why they said they
haven't used it in a while,

36
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,460
but a couple years ago getting YouTube
views, and targeting it down and

37
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,490
getting the right people to view
your video was really, really cheap,

38
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,930
it was just a few cents for
every video of view so that was YouTube.

39
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,420
And it usually starts out when it's new
that there's not a lot of competition.

40
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,190
So if you're the first one there
you'll get the cheapest prices.

41
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,050
It was the same for
Facebook app install ads.

42
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,720
That was a brilliant format and
Facebook started it a few years ago.

43
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,870
And when it just came out,
it was so cheap and

44
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,910
you could take such advantage of that.

45
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,690
And today, everybodyâ€™s there so
competition drives the prices up.

46
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,380
So you kind of need to keep your
eyes open for whatâ€™s new and

47
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,050
what you can take advantage of.
