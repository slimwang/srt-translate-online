00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,420
Firewalls are typically
deployed in network perimeters.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:08,023
But, in addition to network firewalls,
there are also host-based firewalls.

3
00:00:08,023 --> 00:00:12,080
A host-based firewall is
a software module, used to secure

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,920
an individual host, that is to enforce
the host specific security policy.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,710
Similar to a network firewall,
a host-based firewall can filter and

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,060
restrict traffic to and from the host.

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,567
Typically, a host-based firewall
is installed on an internal,

8
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:27,640
important server.
