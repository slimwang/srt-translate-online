00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,056
Here are some more numbers written in scientific notation. Thinking about what

2
00:00:04,056 --> 00:00:07,826
you know about exponents, try to figure out which of these quantities matches

3
00:00:07,826 --> 00:00:13,004
each of these distances. You might want to think about the order of the sizes

4
00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:18,610
in each list to figure this out. Here are the numbers that are your options.

5
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:23,384
1.5 times 10 to the 11th meters, 2.4 times 10 to the 22nd meters, 1.7 times 10

6
00:00:23,384 --> 00:00:27,696
to the 1st meters, 8.8 times 10 to the 5th meters, and 2 times 10 to the

7
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:34,078
negative 4th meters. Each of these matches one of these distances and here are

8
00:00:34,078 --> 00:00:38,560
those distances. The distance from the earth to the sun, the height of a human,

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,322
the distance from San Francisco, California to Paris, France, the distance to

10
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:48,320
the Milky Way's nearest neighboring galaxy Andromeda, and the size of an ant.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,880
Now, just in case you didn't know, a meter is a little bit shorter than a yard.

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,144
It's about the length from your nose to your fingertip if you hold your arm out

13
00:00:55,144 --> 00:00:56,440
sideways.
