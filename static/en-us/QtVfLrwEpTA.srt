00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The final thing I'd like to ask you to do in this homework is

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
create a URL that flushes your cache and that should behave something like this.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay! So I'm looking at the blog and if you scroll down to the bottom,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
you can see there's some age of the query.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And if I already go to /flush

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and we can see when we reload this front page, it is 0 seconds old.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now I made my /flush delete the cache and then redirect to the blog page

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I think that's probably the simplest way to do it,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
although we won't be checking the redirect itself.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We'll just run it and then reload your pages and see what the query time is.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And If I've to go to any of these permanent links that I just clicked on,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
we can see that they all reset to 0 seconds ago as well.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So, when you've got that working, submit the URL to the flush URL here.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And thanks and good luck!
