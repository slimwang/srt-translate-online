1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,700
And the answer is, it'll be Black Discerning Mortimer. So, there's a lot of

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,315
interesting and somewhat surprising stuff going on here. So, I hope when you

3
00:00:07,315 --> 00:00:10,914
solve this, if you did it by an experiment, you tried to find a general rule

4
00:00:10,914 --> 00:00:14,630
instead of just seeing what the result was. If you didn't do that yet, try it

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,050
now, see if you can figure out a general rule for why we end up with this

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,837
result. Then, come back for the explanation, which will follow. So, here's

7
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:23,978
what's going on here. So, we have this class hierarchy. And when we have

8
00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:27,829
multiple base classes the order in which they're listed matters. So, we listed

9
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:31,902
Discerning Bear first. That means, the Discerning Black Bear will inherit the

10
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:36,512
init method from Discerning Bear. What happens in the init method of Discerning

11
00:00:36,512 --> 00:00:40,810
Bear is we call super, passing in Discerning Bear. That means, ignoring

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,700
definition of super bear and calling init. Looking just at this part, you would

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,848
think, well, that means we're going to call the Bear init method. And that's

14
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:51,178
what would normally happen, if we just started with a Discerning Bear. That's

15
00:00:51,178 --> 00:00:54,874
not what happens, though. What we get when we have super (DiscerningBear, self),

16
00:00:54,874 --> 00:00:59,326
well, remember the first class we passed in her means ignore that class. But the

17
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:03,500
next class in the hierarchy, if we look at this, is actually what we got here.

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,543
The super, here, we'll call the init method for the BlackBear. Now the super of

19
00:01:07,543 --> 00:01:11,511
the self object for the BlackBear, now is going to be Bear, and we'll get to the

20
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:14,886
Bear init. So, this is kind of surprising. This is one of the dangers of using

21
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:18,762
multiple inheritence that it becomes pretty tricky to understand what some code

22
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:19,113
means.
