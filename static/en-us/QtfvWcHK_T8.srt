00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,180
Now that we have some basic platforms,
let's make them

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,750
a little bit more presentable by
trying them with the NinePatch.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,650
First, we'll need to add
a PlatformAssets in our class

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,450
to the assets singleton, then,
in Platform's render method,

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,630
we'll just draw it using
the NinePatch instead of a rectangle.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,526
And there we go, much prettier.

7
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:23,630
Follow the to-do's in the course code to
draw some pretty Nine Patch Platforms.
