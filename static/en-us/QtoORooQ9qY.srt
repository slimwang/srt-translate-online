00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,440
The whole tenant of utility computing is that, resources are

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,520
being shared by several potential clients. And we've gotta

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,670
have a mechanism for billing them, so it's extremely important that we have

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:21,330
good ways of measuring the usage of every one of these resources.

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,310
Whether the CPU, memory, storage, or network. And virtualized

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,357
environments have mechanisms for recording both the time

7
00:00:31,357 --> 00:00:36,404
and the space usage of the resources that it possesses, so

8
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:41,329
that it can accurately bill the users of the resources.
