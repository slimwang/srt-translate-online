00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What can you do with language in the world besides amateur astronomy?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Well, I haven't told you yet, but I want to give you a little quiz

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and allow you to guess.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And so for each of these applications here, I want you to tell me

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
whether you think that language models, and specifically these types of word models,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
would be a major part of an implementation of that task.
