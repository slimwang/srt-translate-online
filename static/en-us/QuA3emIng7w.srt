00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,536
So you may be wondering how is that people who grow up in the same family can

2
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:08,010
grow up in different environments? Well, birth order is one way this can

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,342
happen. And by birth order we just simply mean whether you're first child or

4
00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:16,985
second child or fourth child or whatever. Now birth order really can affect our

5
00:00:16,985 --> 00:00:21,702
personalities. In general, the evidence suggests that first born children, for

6
00:00:21,702 --> 00:00:26,439
example, tend to be more conservative. They tend to be more responsible. And

7
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,947
they tend to have a higher self esteem. And then latter born children, people

8
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:34,485
second, and third, and fourth, and so on tend to be more rebellious and

9
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:39,869
challenge the status quo. In fact, the psychologist Frank Sulloway wrote a book

10
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:44,570
called, Born to Rebel and it was all about birth order. And he studied the

11
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,600
history of science and politics and the reason he chose these two areas was

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,410
because they have revolutions pretty regularly. New ideas come on and he wanted

13
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,190
to see who accepted and who rejected these new revolutionary ideas and as it

14
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,090
turns out, the best predictor of who accepted and rejected these new ideas was

15
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:09,168
birth order. First born children tended to reject new ideas in science and

16
00:01:09,168 --> 00:01:14,474
politics. And latter born children tended to accept them. So birth order really

17
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,310
does affect our personalities.
