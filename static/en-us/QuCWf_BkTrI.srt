00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,742
When we talk about processor performance, we typically

2
00:00:03,742 --> 00:00:06,571
talk about its speed, how many instructions per

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:08,779
second can it finish, but we also have

4
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:11,470
to consider its fabrication cost and the power

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,806
consumption it will have. Lower fabrication costs allow

6
00:00:15,806 --> 00:00:18,722
us to put processors that are more powerful

7
00:00:18,722 --> 00:00:22,853
into devices that cannot be expensive, like refrigerators

8
00:00:22,853 --> 00:00:26,180
and watches and all sorts of other things.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,890
Low power consumption is important not only because

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,570
of the cost of electricity, but also because

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,190
it translates into longer battery life and smaller

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,536
form factors for things like cell phones. So what

13
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:40,944
we really want is that the speed of

14
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:45,072
a processor doubles over something like two years, that

15
00:00:45,072 --> 00:00:47,910
the cost of this twice as fast processor

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,780
stays about the same, and that the power consumption

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,585
of this twice as fast processor stays about the same as before. But we don't

18
00:00:57,585 --> 00:01:00,560
have to use technology improvement to get

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,263
this. We can get, instead, a smaller improvement

20
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:09,958
in speed, let's say 1.1x, for about half the cost as the original processor, and

21
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,844
let's say about half the power consumption

22
00:01:12,844 --> 00:01:16,850
of the original processor. Which one of these

23
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,920
do you want? Well, it depends what kind of computer you're building. So, one

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,190
of the jobs of computer architects is

25
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,690
really to figure out, given that the technology

26
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,330
can provide either this or this, or

27
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,210
something in between them. Actually, there are

28
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:37,460
many more options. Which one do I really want for a specific type of computer?
