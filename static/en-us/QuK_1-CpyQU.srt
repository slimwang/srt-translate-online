00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,196
We know that 40 is equal to 4 times 10. So, we can replace the number under the

2
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:08,389
radical with that expression instead. We know that this radical sign here

3
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:12,912
represents a 1 half power outside this entire expression. So, the radical sign

4
00:00:12,924 --> 00:00:17,166
itself should just distribute to the factors inside this term. That means, we

5
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:21,485
can write that this is equal to the square root of 4 times the square root of

6
00:00:21,497 --> 00:00:25,845
10. The square root of 4 is just 2. And if we factorize 10, we see that it's

7
00:00:25,857 --> 00:00:30,415
just equal to 5 times 2. These are the prime factors of 10. Neither of these is

8
00:00:30,427 --> 00:00:34,700
a square. So , that means that we can just leave the square root of 10 as the

9
00:00:34,712 --> 00:00:38,675
square root of 10. This is the simplest form of the square root of 40.
