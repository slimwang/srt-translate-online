00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
One of the greatest things that could happen to a startup is a large company says,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,840
"Hey! I want to invest in you, and I'm really interested in doing something with you guys."

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,680
"We just don't want to be a supplier or a joint venture;

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,470
"we want to put money into your company."

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,390
And I get all the time entrepreneurs who are going, "Yay! Look!"

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,690
"So-and-so is really interested in investing in our company. What a great idea!"

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:29,310
It is a great idea, but you really need to put on your green eyeshades

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,690
and black armbands and roll up your sleeves and really think through here

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,440
what's in it for you versus what's in it for them.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,440
Obviously, if you're a technology-driven company,

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,810
the first thing they want is access to your technology.

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,260
Congratulations.

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,510
But you know, their objectives are not to make you a large company.

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,990
Their objective is to make them a larger company.

15
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,320
So you need to understand what kind of deals do they want.

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,820
"Oh, we want most favored nations clause,

17
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:06,430
"which means if you sign a deal with anybody else, we always want a better deal."

18
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,970
Or my favorite is, "We want an exclusive for a year."

19
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:14,080
Now, all these things sound great from the large company's perspective,

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,970
but the question to ask yourself is, "What do they do for me building my business?"

21
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,460
And I always turn to large companies and turn this around and I'd say,

22
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,410
"You want a 1-year exclusive or you want most favored nations."

23
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,570
"It sounds like you actually want to buy us without actually spending the money,

24
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,400
"because my goal is not to be a small subsidiary of your engineering department,

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,040
"my goal is to build a company your size."

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,170
"And so we need to understand what's in it for both of us."

27
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,690
And so I tend to try to understand, first of all, who's the sponsor and what's the motivation?

28
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,750
And it needs to come from the business side, not just some technology people,

29
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,490
and you can't be dealing with junior biz dev people ultimately

30
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:05,760
because their first offers are always, "One-year exclusives, and we need all these other things."

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,479
And while that's great for them because they have their checklist,

32
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,590
you need to be prepared to walk away.

33
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,540
But if you understand who the sponsor is, you could actually have an adult conversation,

34
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,960
saying, "Listen. This doesn't work for me."

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,610
"Actually, what you want me to do is to be selling to your competitors

36
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,810
"because that's the only way I could grow more resources to make you successful."

37
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,580
"I'm happy to consider how you get an advantage,

38
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,270
"but you can't decide I'm your only supplier."

39
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,980
So one of the ways I tend to deal with these is try to get sales deals, not investments.

40
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,750
That is, to me it's a lot better to get a $10 million order from a company

41
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,900
than a $10 million ownership position that they take

42
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,730
because now they're your boss as well.

43
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,920
Or try to offer warrants--that is, essentially options on buying stock--

44
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,390
based on sales success.

45
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,250
Remember, while it might feel great to have name of big company next to yours

46
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:04,410
for the first year, eventually this will be a lead weight unless it turns into revenue.
