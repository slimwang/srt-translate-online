1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,372
In this case, x would equal 4. Great solving if you found this number. Since we

2
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:09,464
have the log of 3 on both sides of the equation, we know that this number must

3
00:00:09,464 --> 00:00:17,451
equal this number. So, we'll have 2x minus 1 equal to x plus 3. We'll subtract

4
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:23,028
x from both sides to get x minus 1 equals 3. Then we'll add 1 to both sides to

5
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:28,056
get x equals positive 4. If we use some quick mental math, we can see that this

6
00:00:28,056 --> 00:00:33,426
number will be seven and this number will also be seven. So we know the log of

7
00:00:33,426 --> 00:00:39,392
base 3 of seven equals the log of base 3 of seven. Now, I don't actually know

8
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:43,113
the log of base 3 of 7 but since the left side equals the right side, I have an

9
00:00:43,113 --> 00:00:50,153
equivalent relationship. My equation holds true when x equals 4.
