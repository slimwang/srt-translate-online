1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,600
We start with making a more
precise definition of an s-t cut.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,130
Saying that it is
a partition of the vertices

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,740
such that the source s is in A and
the sync t is in B.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:17,010
And B is defined to be the set
of vertices minus those in A.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,000
For example, in this network here,
the green nodes might be A and

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,810
the orange ones B.

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,990
Or we might have this cut here.

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,830
The vertices within one side of the
partition don't have to be connected.

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,820
Next, we observe that f is an s-t flow,
and (A, B) is an s-t cut.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:41,910
Then the value of the flow is equal to
the flow out of A minus the flow into A.

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,740
Which in turn is equal to the flow
into B minus the flow out of B.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:54,008
In this example here, we have 1
plus 1 plus 5 plus 1 exiting A,

13
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:59,473
and 2 units entering over here,
for a total of 6.

14
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:04,486
And similarly for this cut here,
we have 2 exiting here and

15
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:09,916
2 exiting here, and 2 entering here,
again for a total of 6.

16
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:13,500
As you might imagine, the proof
comes from the conservation of flow.

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,510
We start with a definition of flow,
and then add 0 in the form of

18
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,790
the conservation equations for each
node in the A part of the partition.

19
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,850
For every edge where both vertices
are in A, the terms simply cancel,

20
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,930
because it'll pair once here,
and once here.

21
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,270
So we're left with the value
of the flow as being the sum

22
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,290
of the flows over edges.

23
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,830
Between A and B, minus the sum of
the flows over edges between B and A.

24
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,610
But this is just the flow out
of A minus the flow into A,

25
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,740
which of course,
is exactly what we wanted to prove.
