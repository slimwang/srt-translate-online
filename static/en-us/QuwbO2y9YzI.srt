1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,740
So now that we know that cache blocks
need to be at aligned memory addresses,

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,120
let's look at what the memory and
cache look like in terms of blocks.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,800
Our memory can be seen as just
a huge array of memory locations.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,080
Let's say this is location number 0.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,190
And let's say that each
location is 4 bytes wide.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,090
So the next location is at address 4.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,120
And then 8, and so on.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,690
Let's say that our
block size is 16 bytes.

9
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:34,020
That means that a possible
block in memory is this.

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,930
This would be the first block.

11
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,060
This would be the second block.

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,330
This would be the third block,
and so on.

13
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:46,880
A cache, then, can be considered to be
a number of slots where a block can fit.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,930
In this case,
we have just a two-block cache.

15
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,810
So, the cache size is just
equal to two block sizes.

16
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:58,130
So memory has blocks of data,
and our cache

17
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:04,080
has lines which are basically
slots where a block can fit.

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,040
We can say, for example,
that block number 0 can be

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,380
fetched into the cache and
placed in line number 0.

20
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,060
So when we want to make
a precise distinction between

21
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,150
the space in the cache where
we can put a block and

22
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,810
the actual memory content we put there,
the space in the cache is called a line.

23
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,840
And the stuff we put
there is called a block.

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,620
The line size and
the block size are the same.

25
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,830
So a line is effectively a slot
where a block might fit.
