1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,930
So let me show you a better
example of doing it.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:06,190
So here's some input frames taken from,

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,420
I don't remember which campus that is,
okay.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,265
And this is the background model, and
that's a pretty clean background model.

5
00:00:12,265 --> 00:00:15,150
You'll notice most of the people
walking around have disappeared.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,850
These people, of course, are still here,

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,710
because they've been
here the whole time.

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,490
Nothing is here, because these
people have, have walked through.

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,860
When I subtract the two images and

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,190
just take the sort of magnitude of the
value, it's a little hard to see here.

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,700
I get sort of the general value here.

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,420
All right.

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,040
What I can do is I I
can threshold those.

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,840
I say, which points are above
a particular value?

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,100
And those are the points that light up.

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,040
I can then run,
what's called a morphological operator.

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,000
We're going to do that in
just a couple of lessons.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,210
It's just a way of sort of
cleaning up binary,

19
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,430
and what I mean by binary images,
zeroes and ones.

20
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,140
Right?

21
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,910
I can then grow those
regions a little bit and

22
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,500
I can apply that and look at that.

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,020
This has pulled out

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,200
all the people moving around
in this area nice and cleanly.

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,500
With the exception, of course, of these
people because they've been there,

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,800
sitting there, so long that they just
look like they're part of the scenery.

27
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,300
All right?
And that's

28
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,440
what happens with median filtering.

29
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,770
Anything that stays there for a long
time just becomes part of the scenery.

30
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,820
That's actually considered
more of a feature than a bug.

31
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,130
Right?
So somebody parks their car and

32
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,230
pulls in and stays there for a while.

33
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,210
At some point maybe you don't
want to keep tracking it as an,

34
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,250
as an independent object.
