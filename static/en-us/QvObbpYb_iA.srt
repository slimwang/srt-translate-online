Let's talk more about the general shape of a logarithmic function. Now, it's a

2
00:00:04,574 --> 00:00:09,800
bit hard to tell, but none of these graphs here have a horizontal asymptote.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,616
This is similar to how it was hard to tell if that exponential function didn't

4
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:16,908
have a vertical asymptote. It was just growing so fast and getting steeper and

5
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:21,835
steeper. In the same way, since logs are the inverses of exponential functions,

6
00:00:21,835 --> 00:00:27,619
they start to grow more and more slowly as x increases. f of x equals log base

7
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:32,162
a of x does however have a vertical asymptote and it's the same for all of

8
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:35,599
these graphs. What is it?
