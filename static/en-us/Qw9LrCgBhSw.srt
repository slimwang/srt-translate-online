1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The correct answer is the third choice.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What we'd really like to be able to show is that we can reduce

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
some known hard problem to the Diffie-Hellman problem,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and the important thing is that this would show that anyone

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
who can solve the Diffie-Hellman problem would also be able to solve

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
some problem that we already know is hard.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Showing that the problem is hard just shows that if we have a large enough

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
instance of it, it can't be solved with a certain amount of computational resources,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and we hope that by picking a large enough instance

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
we can make the work for the attacker far beyond

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
what any attacker could afford.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That does depend on this property, so it depends on the number of values being high.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That itself is not a useful proof of security.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What we need to know is that there's no easier way to solve the problem

15
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
than trying all the possible values.
