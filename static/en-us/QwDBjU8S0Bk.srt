1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,830
Now, notice that we added 16 in order to complete the square for these two

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:09,298
terms. But the 16 is inside of these parentheses, and there's a factor of two

3
00:00:09,298 --> 00:00:15,198
on the outside of the parentheses. This means that we didn't actually just add

4
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:19,869
16 to the right side of our equation. How much did we really add to the right

5
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:24,445
side of the equation? Enter that number here.
