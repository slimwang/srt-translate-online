00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,120
So first off we want to assign the components to layers. And

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,180
it turns out that our simple rule, having events at the bottom and

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,920
percepts at the top won't quite work for the TextBrowser. Both the ViewPort and

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,920
the ScrollBar handle events and provide percepts. So they both can't be at

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,440
the bottom. And they both can't be a the top. So for the purpose of illustrating

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,830
the layered architecture, we will arbitrarily play the ViewPort on the top.

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,710
Its percept is the most central one to the, to the user.
