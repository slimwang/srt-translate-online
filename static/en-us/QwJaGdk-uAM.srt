A complex number is any number that can be written in the form a plus bi, where

2
00:00:04,611 --> 00:00:09,324
a and b are real numbers. And, of course, i is just the square root of negative

3
00:00:09,324 --> 00:00:14,022
1. This fits with the number that we use as our motivation for coming up with

4
00:00:14,022 --> 00:00:19,292
complex numbers in the first place. Remember that number was 3 plus 4i. So here,

5
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:25,176
a is 3 and b is 4. 3 and 4 are real numbers. So, this is perfect. That fits. 3

6
00:00:25,176 --> 00:00:27,496
plus 4i is a complex number.
