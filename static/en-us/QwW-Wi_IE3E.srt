1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,850
Okay, then the last thing is PSRs,
or Predictive State Representation.

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,260
>> Yes, indeed and
the upshot of the PSR idea was what?

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,970
>> Well, that rather than thinking about
states which might not even exist, and

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,950
even if they do exist you never
know where you're in them or not,

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,759
so really they don't exist in some very
important insane potato sort of way.

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,380
What does make sense to think about is
whether there are specific tests that

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,510
you could take that would then predict
what you are likely to observe.

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,910
And that in some sense that's a very
satisfying way of thinking about

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,950
the world that I need to
kind of keep track of and

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,700
well if I were to do certain
things now what would happen and

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,200
that was kind of the push for
sort of PSRs.

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,500
And in so far as you prefer that kind
of way of thinking about the world,

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,540
the nice thing is that PSRs
can represent any POMDP, and

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,870
so they're equivalent.

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,670
>> Right, except maybe more palatable
philosophically or so forth.

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,160
Certainly Rich Sutton was pushing

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,320
people in the direction of this
representation for that reason.

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,529
There's a kind of philosophical
stance that says.

19
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,519
Am I sick?

20
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,520
What does it mean to be sick?

21
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,790
It means that I [LAUGH]
could be dead tomorrow,

22
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,460
I could be stuck in bed tomorrow,
I could be running a fever.

23
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,060
It's like there's a bunch of observable
things that are a function of

24
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,380
what the current state is, and so

25
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,960
it might be useful to talk about things
in terms of what those predictions

26
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,300
are as opposed to positing some
kind of magical internal state.

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,710
>> Well, this makes sense right
because the only usefulness.

28
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,260
If you go back to that and we talked
about this on our lesson management

29
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:35,300
course in some sense the only
usefulness of a state is what it allows

30
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,610
you to predict about what's going to
happen next, little made of objects.

31
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,880
So, the only reason it's worthwhile
even recognizing something as a state

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,390
is it allows me to distinguish
between something else that might be

33
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,680
important later.

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,080
So right, so another one of our
universal contradictory truths is that

35
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,230
states and
predictors are kind of the same thing.

36
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,530
>> Yeah, all things are the same.

37
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,110
>> Excellent, all right,

38
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,030
so I think that's the last lesson
that I was doing by myself.

39
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,080
I think I'm going to turn it
over to you for the next one.

40
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,760
>> Well, I will point out that
you none of this by yourself like

41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,600
we've done this together.

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,970
>> That's fair.

43
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,780
>> Alright, well with that I
guess we should say goodbye.

44
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,440
>> Alright, see you next time.

45
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,143
>> Bye.

46
00:02:09,143 --> 00:02:10,374
