00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The error is due to the variable tag being set. How do we know that this variable is being set?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let me introduce you to one of the most powerful

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
debugging tools ever invented which is the assert statement.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The statement assert followed by a condition, evaluates the condition and aborts the execution

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
raising an exception if condition is false--that is if the condition holds, we proceed as usual.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If the condition does not hold, we throw an exception.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
With the statement, we can now go and check the value of tag all through the loop.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So again we say, in our hypothesis tag is being set and we use assert to check that.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
With this statement assert not tag should tag ever be set will we immediately get an exception

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and again we can check this with foo enclosed in double quotes.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So in order to confirm the hypothesis, we would expect an assert exception.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What is the output really? Let's make this a quiz.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now that we change the program to include assert not tag, what's going to happen?

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Does the program raise an exception or is the case that the output is still foo as before.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The assertion is not violated and tag is not set during the entire loop. Over to you.
