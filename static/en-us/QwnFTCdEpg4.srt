00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,600
I want you now to consider
overfitting in KNN.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,190
So in this case our horizontal
access will be K and

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,935
it could range again from 1 out to N,

4
00:00:11,935 --> 00:00:16,750
the number of data points and
then the vertical access will be error.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,680
I'm going to draw three charts here
showing N sample error as a factor of

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,570
K and
out of sample error as a factor of K.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,390
And I want you to look at each one of
them and consider which one of them you

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,210
think is the proper representation of
what that ought to look like for KNN.

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,820
Which of these three charts
correctly represents the shape that

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,240
we would expect for out of sample
error and in sample error for

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,880
KNN, as K increases this way and
error increases that way.

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,258
So take a look and go ahead and
fill in your answer over here.
