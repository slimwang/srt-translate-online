1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
And of course, the only thing you shouldn't do is give up. Everything else--yes.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,770
Carefully check your proof. Have somebody else check your proof.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,970
Maybe the NP completeness isn't there, and if your proof is correct, think about

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,050
modifying your problem--maybe it becomes easier on that case.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,590
And finally, look forward to the next units where we will discuss

6
00:00:19,590 --> 99:59:59,999
countermeasures against NP completeness.
