00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,420
It's great that we have this new equation with variable names that are more

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,684
appropriate for our situation. But this equation does look a little bit

3
00:00:07,684 --> 00:00:12,728
strange. We're talking about y, the amount of solution ordered. And how it

4
00:00:12,728 --> 00:00:16,952
depends on x, the total cost of the order. So typically, we would want y by

5
00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:20,201
itself on one side of the equation to show exactly how it depends on x,

6
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:25,496
mathematically. If we make that happen, what will be on this other side of the

7
00:00:25,496 --> 00:00:26,789
equation?
