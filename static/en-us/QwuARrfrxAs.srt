1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,580
Okay, so the next question is, what
kind of backend stack do we want to use?

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,200
Now, I really want to get something
that's going to be quick to set up,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,030
because we should get Shopping
List Plus Plus in users' hands as

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,630
fast as possible.

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,240
I'm pretty solid with Android, but

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,210
it's been a really long time
since I set up a server.

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,180
>> Well,
maybe you don't need to set up a server.

8
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,191
Have you ever heard of [SOUND] Firebase?

9
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:24,186
>> Hm, well, I'm intrigued,
I have heard of Firebase,

10
00:00:24,186 --> 00:00:26,477
it's like a fancy database, right?

11
00:00:26,477 --> 00:00:27,760
>> It's fancy, all right.

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,020
>> Okay.

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,314
>> Seriously,
Firebase is a collection of services,

14
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:35,825
including a database that can serve
as a simple backend for your app.

15
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:38,605
>> Okay, that sounds great, but
is it easy to use with Android?

16
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:39,145
>> Very easy.

17
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:42,785
It has an SDK for
Android as well as iOS and JavaScript.

18
00:00:42,785 --> 00:00:46,240
With Firebase you write a little client
side code, and then Firebase takes care

19
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,720
of all the rest,
some authentication and access to data.

20
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,533
>> Well, I definitely like the idea of
not setting up a bunch of server code,

21
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:57,177
so I guess I could read up
on Firebase a little bit and

22
00:00:57,177 --> 00:01:00,580
kind of prep the GitHub repository for
the developer.

23
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,820
>> In the meantime, I'll poke around and
set up an account, so you and

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,840
your developer can poke
around with the SDK.

25
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,250
>> All right, that sound great!

26
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,990
>> Follow me, and
let's get started with Firebase.
