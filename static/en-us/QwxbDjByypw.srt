00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,279
Now that you've seen how to use
an existing content provider

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:05,439
in this lesson you'll build your own.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,210
This will not only give you the ability
to share data with other apps but

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,089
also because content providers are part
of the Android framework, this will let

5
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:17,660
you work with other framework classes to
most efficiently load and display data.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,800
You'll be building a content
provider for a to do list app

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,109
that lets you create and display a list
of prioritized tasks to complete.

8
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,579
You'll add new tasks,
query the data, and

9
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:30,599
delete tasks all through
the content provider.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,228
After working through this app,

11
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:35,390
you'll then update the way
data is managed in Sunshine.

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,660
And you'll add a provider to act as
a layer between the database that stores

13
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:42,079
weather information and
the UI that displays it.

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,890
Since you've already learned
a lot about SQLite and providers,

15
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,106
we'll start off by taking a quick look
at the to do list app,and the code you

16
00:00:48,106 --> 00:00:51,550
will be starting with, then we'll jump
straight to into building a provider.
