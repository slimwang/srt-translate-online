1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,550
I simply made up the anisotropic function out of my head. However, there's

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,494
considerable research about how to capture BRDFs from materials, and how to

3
00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:11,647
make functions to compactly represent them. BRDFs are just the start. There's

4
00:00:11,647 --> 00:00:15,872
also the BSDF, the Beet Sugar Development Foundation. We're more interested in

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:19,408
the Bi-Directional Scattering Distribution Function. This type of function

6
00:00:19,408 --> 00:00:23,227
captures both how light reflects from and transmits through material. There's

7
00:00:23,227 --> 00:00:27,436
also the BSSRDFs which stands for Bidirectional Surface Scattering Reflectance

8
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:32,188
Distribution Function. Say that one three times fast. This function is

9
00:00:32,188 --> 00:00:35,364
important for materials like marble and milk. For these materials in

10
00:00:35,364 --> 00:00:38,492
particular, the light enters one location on the surface, bounces around inside

11
00:00:38,492 --> 00:00:42,808
the material, and comes out somewhere nearby. One other extremely important

12
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:46,633
material that has this sort of scattering is skin. Getting skin to look good

13
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:50,130
for interactive rendering can be quite involved. But the results are more

14
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,548
convincing than using some simple reflection model. See the additional course

15
00:00:53,548 --> 00:00:57,764
materials for more information. That said, the key factor here is scale. The

16
00:00:57,764 --> 00:01:00,788
effect of subsurface scattering lessens as the viewer's distance from the

17
00:01:00,788 --> 00:01:04,748
object increases. Close up, a photon might exit at a location that's a fair

18
00:01:04,748 --> 00:01:08,788
number of pixels away from where it entered the surface. From farther away,

19
00:01:08,788 --> 00:01:12,877
they may be no change in pixel location. In fact the diffuse component for all

20
00:01:12,877 --> 00:01:16,786
non-metallic materials comes from subsurface scattering. It's just that in many

21
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:21,224
cases this scattering is over an imperceptably small distance. Metals

22
00:01:21,224 --> 00:01:24,842
themselves are essentially all specular. Let me say that again, because all

23
00:01:24,842 --> 00:01:29,420
this time we've been living a lie. Metallic objects have no lambertian diffuse

24
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,898
term. Well, not a lie, I just like being dramatic. Really, diffuse is simply an

25
00:01:33,898 --> 00:01:37,670
approximation of which we should be aware. Using it's fine, even high-quality

26
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,190
applications do so. It's quick to compute and looks plausible. In reality,

27
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,094
metals can indeed be given a roughened surface to give them a glossier, diffuse

28
00:01:45,094 --> 00:01:49,984
look. So, a diffuse term is fine. However, on a an atomic level, metallic

29
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:53,746
objects have a free floating soup of electrons on the surface which absorbs and

30
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:57,998
reemits incoming photons. If your surface represents a shiny metal, you

31
00:01:57,998 --> 00:02:01,588
probably don't want a diffuse term. Insulators have a diffuse term because the

32
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:05,060
photons undergo subsurface scattering. Most of the time the entry and exit

33
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,973
points are so close together it doesn't matter. But the direction of exit

34
00:02:08,973 --> 00:02:12,435
certainly does. Materials such as that in an unglazed clay pot, concrete, and

35
00:02:12,435 --> 00:02:15,635
even the moon itself, are rough enough that the lambertian reflection model

36
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,968
doesn't capture them fully. This again turns out to be a matter of scale,

37
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:22,896
having to do with the relationship of surface roughness with subsurface

38
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:27,646
scattering. Admittedly, trying to capture all of these effects leads to a lot

39
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:31,625
of work and possibly inefficient shaders. These subsurface scattering

40
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,838
renderings are from 3D Studio Max and rendered offline, not at interactive

41
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:39,039
rates. The main thing is to realize we don't have to stick with illumination

42
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,601
models from the 1970's because of inertia or ignorance. Using reflection models

43
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:47,060
based on how the real world works has a number of advantages. First and

44
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,030
foremost, if everything is properly modeled, your virtual world acts like the

45
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,855
real world. Change lighting conditions, and you don't have to tweak material

46
00:02:53,855 --> 00:02:57,505
settings to look good. For design software, this assurance can mean that you

47
00:02:57,505 --> 00:03:00,085
can trust what you see on the screen to have some relationship to what you

48
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:04,770
manufacture. Physically based rendering is also a great help to virtual world

49
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,370
content creators, such as game and film makers. It's a time saver to have

50
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,604
predictable illumination models, as the artist does not have to learn obscure

51
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:16,118
sliders that have no real world counterparts. It's vastly reassuring, knowing

52
00:03:16,118 --> 00:03:19,062
that materials won't show some glitch from a certain angle, and knowing that

53
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:23,410
lighting can be changed without destroying the sense of realism. Rather than

54
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,324
limit creativity, a well-designed system makes for a more productive and

55
00:03:26,324 --> 00:03:28,190
unrestrictive environment.
