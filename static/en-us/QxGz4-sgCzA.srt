1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,310
Sounds good Sarah.

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,750
So like Sarah said,

3
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,730
the first step will be to get her
changes into my local repository.

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,300
Right now if I run git log on the master
branch, I don't see Sarah's commit.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,510
So I'll need to run git pull.

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,790
And I'll pull from the origin
remote in the master branch.

7
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,600
Recall that if I wanted to take another
look at Sarah's changes first, I could

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,470
run git fetch, examine the changes, and
then run git merge origin/master master.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,590
But since I already know what her
changes are, I ran git pull instead.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,790
Now I want these changes
to be incorporated into

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,935
the different-oil branch, so
I'll run git checkout different-oil, and

12
00:00:38,935 --> 00:00:42,140
then git merge master different-oil.

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,690
As expected, I get a merge conflict.

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,200
I'll resolve the conflict keeping both
of our changes, so now there's three

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,260
quarters of the cup of canola oil,
and then I'll commit the merge.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,330
Now I'll run git log, and

17
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,420
I can see that this branch
contains both of our changes.

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,330
Here's where the more oil
pull request was merged, and

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,770
here's the merge commit
that I just made.

20
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,280
Now go ahead and repeat these
steps in your own repository.

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,210
In order to get Sarah's changes to
appear in your fork, you'll need to

22
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,860
download and run the code we've
provided in the downloadables section.

23
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,950
There are instructions on how to
do this in the instructor's notes.

24
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,680
Now this code won't actually
make a pull request, so

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,880
you won't see a pull request
appear in your repository.

26
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,940
Instead, if you look at your
commit history on GitHub,

27
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,550
you should see a commit that looks like
this one, saying, merge pull request.

28
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,740
And you should also see Sarah's commit,
adding more oil so the cake is moist.

29
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,650
Once you've run the code to
simulate Sarah's changes,

30
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,770
update your local repository
with Sarah's changes and

31
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,650
merge your master branch into your
different-oil branch, like I did.

32
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,510
Finally, push your different-oil
branch to your fork to

33
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,660
update your pull request,
which I haven't done yet.

34
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,550
Once you're done, here are some
things you can check to verify that

35
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,550
everything has gone correctly.

36
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,099
Your local master branch should
contain Sarah's changes.

37
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,969
Your local different-oil branch
should contain the merge commit,

38
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:03,660
merging Sarah's changes
into your branch.

39
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,940
The same merge commit should be
visible on your pull request.

40
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,720
And the merge button on your
pull request should be green.

41
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,070
Check these boxes once these
things are true for you.
