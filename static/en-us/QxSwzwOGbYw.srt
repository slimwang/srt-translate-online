1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,400
From here on out I'm going to
assume that you want to be a hedge

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,440
fund manager.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,590
And one of your first tasks as a hedge
fund manager is to get investors.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,430
So who might your investors be?

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,480
There are three major types
of investors in hedge funds.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,270
Of course, there's others besides these,
but these are the three main types.

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,100
Individuals, in other words, a single
person that wants to invest in a fund.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,580
Of course,
these are typically very wealthy folks.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:36,610
Keep in mind that hedge funds typically
can only have up to 100 investors.

10
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:41,070
So they want each of those
investments to be fairly large so

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,070
that they can manage, of course,
a significant amount of funds.

12
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,660
So the individuals who invest in
hedge funds are typically, as I said,

13
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,070
very wealthy.

14
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,690
Institutions.

15
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,470
What do I mean by Institutions?

16
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,950
These are things like very
large retirement funds,

17
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,770
like CalPERS out in California.

18
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,680
These are university foundations like
the Harvard University Foundation or

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,970
the Georgia Tech Foundation.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,970
In other words, institutions,
very often non-profit

21
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,160
institutions that have a large sum of
money that they need to keep somewhere.

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,350
And of course, they'd like to
see an accrual in value, so

23
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,750
that's one reason they
look to hedge funds.

24
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,510
And finally, funds of funds.

25
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,570
What funds of funds do is they

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,900
group together the funds of many
individuals or institutions.

27
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,290
So for instance, you might be
an individual that could, say,

28
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,910
invest in one hedge fund, but

29
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,790
you'd really like to get the advantage
of investing in several funds.

30
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,210
So you might allow your money
to be collected by a manager of

31
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,760
funds of funds.

32
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,110
And then that manager would gather
together all these assets and

33
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,730
pick carefully several hedge
funds to invest that money in.

34
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,320
So besides knowing who
your investors might be,

35
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,380
it's critically important to know
why they might invest in your fund.

36
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,330
How can you present the case
to them that will convince

37
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,310
them that they should let
you manage their money?

38
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,190
Here are at least some of
the criteria that folks like this

39
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,080
would consider before
investing in a hedge fund.

40
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,320
Track record.

41
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,490
So if your fund has a great
track record, that's, of course,

42
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:30,780
some of the best evidence that it's
going to continue to work well.

43
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,610
Many institutional investors will
want to see a good track record for

44
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,310
at least five years before they'll
invest in a particular fund.

45
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,490
Now if you're a young whippersnapper
hedge fund manager and

46
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,230
you don't have five years yet,
what are you going to do?

47
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,840
Well, what you can do is simulate or
back test your strategy, and

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,620
investors will consider
these simulations.

49
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,600
But that simulation has
to be backed by a very

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,310
compelling story
describing that strategy.

51
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,540
In other words, you've gotta have
a reason for why this method works and

52
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,340
it needs to make sense.

53
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,290
And finally, they consider how your
strategy fits within their portfolio.

54
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:21,240
In other words, if your strategy is for
large cap S&P 500 stocks, and they've

55
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,420
already got that covered with another
fund, they might not consider you.

56
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,680
However, if you, for instance,
are looking at small cap growth stocks,

57
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,380
and they don't yet have that
part of their portfolio filled,

58
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,510
they'll give you some more thought.
