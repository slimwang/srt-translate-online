00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,112
To continue our discussion on stereotypes, we're going to go back to Dr Markie

2
00:00:03,112 --> 00:00:07,440
Blumer, who you may remember from the motivation and emotions lesson. She's

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,781
going to talk about gender stereotypes. Can we talk a little bit about how

4
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:14,462
women and men may be discriminated against, because of their sexual behavior?

5
00:00:14,462 --> 00:00:18,638
>> Right. So, actually this idea of sort of what we would call maybe gender

6
00:00:18,638 --> 00:00:22,994
stereotypes around sexuality and sexual behavior for both men and women, they

7
00:00:22,994 --> 00:00:29,230
do lead to discrimination. women being people who tend to hold less power in

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,434
places pretty much all over the world. that isn't different in terms of sexual

9
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:38,878
contact so, they've typically had less power. What I mean by that is that

10
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:44,160
they've had less of a voice. Less freedom around their sexual behaviors,

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,864
practices, their beliefs, as well as their dress. Sexual stereotypes and gender

12
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:54,220
stereotypes actually hurt both people. so, just as women have been confined or

13
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,188
relegated to certain positions in terms of sexual stereotypes and gender

14
00:00:58,188 --> 00:01:04,144
stereotypes. Things like if they dress a certain way then, then they are

15
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:10,166
expecting to have people, flirt with them or hit on them. Or, or they should

16
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:15,102
you know, engage in sexual behavior because they're dressed certain way. So,

17
00:01:15,102 --> 00:01:19,538
they are asking for it. Those types of practices are again ways that women's

18
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:23,630
gender and the expectations men and women have of their gender around sex have,

19
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,855
have harmed them. There's been a lot of discrimination, a lot of pain and

20
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:34,111
suffering associated with that for women. women enjoying sex have been called

21
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:39,023
all sorts of names. Women who have more sexual partners than men have also been

22
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:44,461
called all sorts of names. Really harmful things. Lots of shaming that's taken

23
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:49,477
place. but if you look at those stereotypes for men, it's also pretty bad. The

24
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:53,460
differences that they typically have more power in society. So, they aren't

25
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,682
harmed in quite the same way. But there are stereotypes that also do affect

26
00:01:57,682 --> 00:02:01,997
them, things like men should want to have sex. They should want to have sex

27
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:05,754
with lots of people. if they don't want to do these things, then they're not

28
00:02:05,754 --> 00:02:10,023
really a man, and there's something wrong with them. And they get called all

29
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:14,497
sorts of names as well, typically names that are pejoratively feminine. so,

30
00:02:14,497 --> 00:02:19,970
again that's denigrating to women and men. but definitely, people of, of

31
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,650
genders, men and women genders, have been harmed by the stereotypes that exist

32
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,306
around sexuality for both of them. And we really all have to work together to

33
00:02:30,306 --> 00:02:34,200
understand that all people regardless of their genitalia and their gender

34
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,917
identification, have the right to be self loving and loving of each other in

35
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:44,159
sexual manners if they have the freedom a desire to so choose to be.
