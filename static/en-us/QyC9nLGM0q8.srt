00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
All right. Our penultimate question on regular expressions.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Which of the following sentences are true? Check all that apply.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Any regular expression written using + could be rewritten without +

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but match exactly the same set of strings.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There is no regular expression that catches all strings that look like a^n.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Remember this exponentiation here means copies so this would be a, aa, aaa.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There's no regular expression that gets that whole infinite set.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Here, there's no regular expression for a^n b^n,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
so this would be ab, aabb, aaabbb

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and then down here every regular expression has an associated finite state machine

11
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that recognizes the same strings.
