1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,080
This time we make sure that
the new recording label and

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,810
stop button stay in the correct
position and size, at all times.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,395
Much like the original record button,

4
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:12,190
we need to add constraints to
these two interface elements.

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,650
First we have to think about what we
want, which is three UI elements,

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,500
one beneath the other,
centered on screen.

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,370
They should always be in the center,

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,380
regardless if we're running the app on
a small iPhone or the new iPad Pro.

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,240
We already have a recording button
centered on the main UI View

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,740
over our View Controller so

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,120
we can anchor the other two
views off the recording button.

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,640
Let's start with the recording label.

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,720
The recording label is this one
here that says tap to record.

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,770
With it selected, let's control drag
diagonally to the record button.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,800
The menu that comes up is context
sensitive to the direction of the drag.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,720
If you just do a straight up and down or

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,060
left to right drag, you only get
a subset of the constrained options.

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,210
With the shift key held down,
select vertical spacing and

19
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,370
centered horizontally,
then click add constraints.

20
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,150
This means that we want to maintain
the vertical spacing from the recording

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,400
button to this label, and

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,350
then we want to label to be centered
horizontally to the record button.

23
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,480
So how does auto layout know where
the label needs to be on screen?

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,520
It checks to see where the record
button is and placed this label,

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,090
based on that, using the two
constraints that you've just setup.

26
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,610
If you're remembering back to earlier,

27
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,560
how I mentioned that there
are two constraints needed for

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,370
each axis, two for the x and
two for the y, you're correct.

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,930
However the label, much like
the UIButton, has an intrinsic size.

30
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,830
So auto layout can figure
out the height and

31
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,970
width of the label based on the text and
font of the label.

32
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,130
So all we need to provide is where
to place it along the x and y-axis.

33
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,880
In other words, just one constraint for
the x and one constraint for the y.

34
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,200
Let's set up the constraints of the stop
recording button against the tap to

35
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,910
record label.

36
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,680
Once more, drag the agony from
to stop recording button to

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,800
the tap to record label.

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,970
With the shift key pressed down,
select vertical spacing and

39
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,270
center horizontally,
then click add constraints.

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,160
We should be able to see six
constraints under the constraints

41
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,640
section of the document outline.

42
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,660
Your number here inside these
constraints may vary a little bit from

43
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,590
20 to 21 to 23 and they may be a little
different than mine and that's ok.

44
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,590
They're based on where you placed
your UI elements in the storyboards

45
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,940
when you dragged them in.

46
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,190
Let's see if this worked.

47
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,230
Click run or press command R and

48
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,920
you should see the Pitch Perfect
app running on the iOS simulator.

49
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,670
Let's try different screen orientations
to see if they stay centered.

50
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,810
You can see here that they stay
center of the landscape and would see

51
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,610
the same if we switch to different
iOS simulators such as the iPad air.

52
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,110
We should see here, that our three
buttons are always centered on screen.

53
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,520
Remember it may seem frustrating now,
that's okay.

54
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,420
You're just learning and

55
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,672
this is likely one of the first
times you've tried auto layout.

56
00:02:59,672 --> 00:03:02,210
Keep at it and
it'll become second nature in no time.
