1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,404
Now we're going to do a full 1 sample t test from start to finish. And that

2
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:09,835
includes the t test, the confidence interval, Cohen's d and r squared. We're

3
00:00:09,835 --> 00:00:13,160
going to do the whole thing, just like we would in a real research study.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,890
Before we do, it's important for you to gather some important information and

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,436
some important tools. I'm going to list these tools and the information right

6
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,976
here, be sure you get them. You'll need some paper and some pencils. You'll

7
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:27,528
also need a calculator that has a square root and an exponent button. You're

8
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,998
going to need the following formulas, so right them down on a separate sheet of

9
00:00:29,998 --> 00:00:33,781
paper and keep them handy throughout this example. You're going to need to do

10
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:37,750
degrees of freedom, n minus 1. You'll also need the standard error of the mean,

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,822
which is a sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample

12
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:45,598
size. You're going to need the formula for the one sample t test and recall

13
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:49,690
that is the sample mean minus the population mean divided by the standard error

14
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:55,302
of the mean. The formula for the confidence interval is X bar plus or minus the

15
00:00:55,302 --> 00:00:59,440
margin of error. Remember the formula for the margin of error is t critical

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,516
times the standard error of the mean. You will also need Cohen's d, which is

17
00:01:03,516 --> 00:01:07,778
the mean difference divided by the standard deviation for the sample. And

18
00:01:07,778 --> 00:01:13,790
finally, r squared, which is t squared over t squared plus degrees of freedom.

19
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,129
Again this is not t critical, this is the t that comes from the t test.
