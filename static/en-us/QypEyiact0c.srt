1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,250
The mean integrated standard error is the expectation values

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,700
of the square of the difference between the estimated PDF and the true PDF.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,360
We will see this expression a lot in lesson four,

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,009
when we're validating any model in general.

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:24,580
This is a loss function that is used quite often, in model building.

6
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:32,060
The AMISE is the asymptotic limit of the mean integrated standard error.

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,320
It is often difficult to calculate this integral.

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:42,020
And we take some asymptotic value for the integral as an approximation.

9
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,780
Breaking the mean integrated standard error into its component,

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,720
we get some irreducible variance that comes from the data set itself.

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,030
The bias square determines the smoothness of our kernel density estimate for

12
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,990
different bandwidths.

13
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:04,498
The variance determines the jaggediness of the kernel density estimate for

14
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,260
a different bandwidths.

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,650
So the choosing the right bandwidth is a tradeoff between the Bias square and

16
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,470
the variance.

17
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,600
We will learn a lot more about these two quantities in the next lesson,

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,810
where we emphasize validation of models.
