1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here's a quick quiz. Which of these would be a good algorithm or technique

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
for doing this classification into things like people, places, and drugs.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Could we use Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Could we use the Unix Sort command or the Gzip command?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Check all those that you think would be reasonably good algorithms

6
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
for doing classification.
