00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,150
Let's see what it takes
to load up a nine patch.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,900
So first of all we just load up the
texture that we're going to be making

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,370
into a nine patch, and then the nine
patch constructor just takes the texture

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,560
and how much to chop of the top,
left, bottom, and

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,740
right to define the nine patches.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,450
In this case, the edge of our
scalable image has size eight.

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,590
So for instance the top left corner
is an eight by eight square.

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,610
The top edge is eight pixels deep and
so on.

9
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,690
Drawing a texture versus drawing with
a nine patch is almost identical.

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,700
The only difference is you call
batch draw passing in a texture, but

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,090
with the nine patch, you call draw and
then pass in the sprite batch.

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,310
And here we can see the results of
drawing with a nine patch verses drawing

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,600
with a texture.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,310
If we draw a texture at a small size and
then at a larger size,

15
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,326
the screw heads get all tiny and
it doesn't scale very beautifully.

16
00:00:52,326 --> 00:00:55,520
With a nine patch on the other hand,
the size of the screw heads is

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,790
always identical, regardless of
the scale of the overall nine patch.

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,950
Time for you to load up the texture,

19
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,200
chop it into nine patch, and
draw it out at a couple different sizes.
