1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,300
Another example is basically
we can get depth cues

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,420
basically by illuminating
the scene with a structured light.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,660
In the past case,

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,310
the light was the intensity of the light
that will basically being put up and

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,710
how it shaded the image was used
to kind of reconstruct a shape.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,550
Here, just by figuring out the stripes
and how well it's lit and using that

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,670
information and, again, you notice
that these stripes are very useful,

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,990
because I can, now I can trace the curve
to get the shape of this statue here.

9
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,130
And this can be used to model 3D
environments or 3D scenes like this.

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,430
This is a widely used technique for

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,410
doing range scanning of rooms and,
or people and statues,

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,030
and stuff like that and sometimes they
even use laser lights to do this.

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,570
Another method is shape from texture.

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,180
Here, I'm basically showing an example
where basically just looking at

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,410
the texture as a change knowing
that this is a regular texture.

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,425
We can actually compute
the shape of a cloth like this.

17
00:00:56,425 --> 00:00:59,585
Also something we've played
around a little bit so far and

18
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:01,125
talked about cameras.

19
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:05,835
We can actually even get shape the focus
that is by being are to focus and

20
00:01:05,835 --> 00:01:07,425
defocus an image.

21
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:08,855
In this case focusing on this one and

22
00:01:08,855 --> 00:01:12,865
that one,
you can actually compute depth.

23
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:16,660
So here basically showing you the two
images, focusing and defocusing.

24
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,120
You can actually use this to compute
a depth image like the one shown here.

25
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,200
A very well known method is also
using structure from motion

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,830
in this case by moving the camera along,
around this building and

27
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,960
taking multiple pictures and then
actually doing things like we've looked

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,620
at already feature detection and
stuff, making sure that these features

29
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,650
are actually then matched
across these images.

30
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,450
I can actually construct
the geometry of the scene.

31
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,660
In this case, these cloud points
are being used to used to create a model

32
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,030
of the building that is there.

33
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,250
It's a widely used technique,

34
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,520
we'll actually see another example
of this in a future lecture
