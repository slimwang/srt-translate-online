1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,630
What's really cool about those examples,
is that you don't have to know much

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,620
about the problem that
you're trying to solve.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,800
All you need is data.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,740
Lot's of data.

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,370
And computers.

6
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,450
Lot's of them.

7
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,020
And off you go.

8
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,750
You can build a machine or
any system that often does much

9
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,540
better than specialized,
handcrafted approaches to the problem.

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,720
So, here we are.

11
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,440
With those tools in your back pockets,
you can now train models that can

12
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,850
predict from images, texts, sequences,
or any kind of data, for that matter.

13
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,080
If you're curious, there's a ton more
to learn in the field of deep learning.

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,940
Things also change every day as
new techniques get developed and

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,840
people find new ways
to use those models.

16
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,080
Even with just what you've learned in
this class you have the tools to design

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,590
and train real models on real data,
so what are you going to try first?
