00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,980
When I started in game development,

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,390
state of the art graphics
were based on pallets.

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,250
So, you have a certain number of slots
for the different colors you could

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,390
display at once, and
typical screen resolution was tiny.

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,720
Imagine how chunky a game would look
at 320 x 240, or even 320 x 200.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,100
Just a few years later, there were
flip phones with higher resolution.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,460
It was certainly a challenge
to make games look good.

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:28,670
Especially when you were limited to 32,
or 64, or even 256 colors.

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,300
If you wanted to shade an object,
for example,

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,200
you had to make sure to reserve space in
the palette for the color gradations.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,810
Usually just a few inches each for the
major colors like red, yellow, and blue.

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,330
It's also made anti-aliasing
tricky because

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,840
it's basically just color blending.

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,310
So there goes more of your palette.

15
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,770
At the time we were using dot products
to do rudimentary light source shading.

16
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,530
Everything had a very cartoony
look since the colors didn't

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,000
change smoothly over
the surface of an object, and

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,030
they tended to pop between values
as objects moved in the scene.

19
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,220
We didn't care.

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,880
We just thought it was cool that
shapes were more realistic looking,

21
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,910
even if they were really crude.
