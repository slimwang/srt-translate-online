1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,140
So let's think about how we can
get those same values from data.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,820
Instead of you knowing in advance what
the model of this particular markoff

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,620
chain is.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,030
So let's imagine that in fact,

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,812
what happens is we're going to do a
series of simulations starting from S1.

6
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:17,630
It's going to hop around and
with some probability it's going to hop.

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,770
It's going to go S1 to S3 and
then either S4 or S5 and then to SF and

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,180
then it stops.

9
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,620
And so let's imagine that we've done
that and these are the episodes.

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,480
These are the sequences
that come out of it that.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,780
So the first time we run it it
goes from S1 to S3 to S4 to SF.

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,340
The next time it goes
S1 to S3 to S5 to SF,

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,020
then it goes S1 to S3 to S4 to SF,
and so on.

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,900
So what I'm interested in is
how we would actually estimate.

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,580
Develop an estimate of
the value of state one.

16
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,970
Given just this data after say
the first three episodes, or

17
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,540
the first four episodes.

18
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,910
The fifth episode doesn't involve S1 so
presumably it shouldn't.

19
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,260
Well, we'll get to what happens then.

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,500
But first I want to think about after
the first three or after the first four.

21
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,600
That makes sense?

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,100
>> Sure, I can do that.

23
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,290
>> Excellent, all right, so do that.

24
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:09,790
>> All right, go.
