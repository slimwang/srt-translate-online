1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,709
With joint variation, though, the variations do not both need to be direct. One

2
00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:08,615
quantity might have direct variation, while the other might have inverse

3
00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:13,210
variation. For example, if x and y had direct variation, they would both

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:18,929
increase, or they would both decrease. And if z varied inversely with x, then if

5
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:24,435
x increased, z would have to decrease. When setting up the proportion, this

6
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:28,725
means that since x varies directly with y, they will be directly across from one

7
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:33,443
another. But since x varies inversely with z, we'll see this z quantity in the

8
00:00:33,443 --> 00:00:38,266
denominator. We flip this fraction. So let's assume this is still true. X is

9
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:42,926
varying directly with y, and inversely with z. If the value of x is 10 when y

10
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:48,923
equals 5 and z equals 6. I want you to find the value of x when y is 7 and z is

11
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:55,524
1. As a hint, this is one case, this x could be 10, this y is 5, and this z is

12
00:00:55,524 --> 00:01:00,727
6. So you try and fill in the other values and then solve for x. And keep in

13
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:05,325
mind in the setup, we had direct variation with y, so this is directly across

14
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:09,615
from each other Whereas we had inverse variation with c. This c is a

15
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:15,893
denominator. Write your answer for x here. You can also think about we're really

16
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:18,865
finding x too, this value. Good luck.
