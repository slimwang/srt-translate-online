For your first practice problem, try finding f of g of 1, f of g of 2, and f of

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:11,064
g of x. These two should be numbers and this should be a function containing

3
00:00:11,064 --> 00:00:16,370
the variable x. Here's the function for f of x and here's the function for g of

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,720
x. Good luck on this one.
