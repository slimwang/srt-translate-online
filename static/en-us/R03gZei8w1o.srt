00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,879
We're now going to move to
a class of AI problems,

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,990
where it's not as easy
to find a solution.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,839
In search,
we generally have a few correct routes.

4
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:11,753
And we have a few algorithms
that help us find that route,

5
00:00:11,753 --> 00:00:13,539
in a fairly straightforward way.

6
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:16,500
However, in some problems,
the state space is so large

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,980
that we need other techniques to search
the space and find optimal solutions.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,600
In this lesson we'll look
at simulated annealing,

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,140
one such technique to navigate
a potentially large space.

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,490
In particular, we'll use simulated
annealing to solve the n-Queens problem.

11
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:32,769
A puzzle where we try and

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,340
set up n-Queens on a board, in such
a way that they can't attack each other.

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,040
Let's get started.
