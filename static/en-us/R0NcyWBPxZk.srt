1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,046
So here's where we're executing the
insert query and the AddPost function.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,420
And now if we change this to just
have a comma and a tuple after here,

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,530
after this percent s, and
make sure to have enough parentheses,

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,261
we should have a forum that's safe
against the SQL injection attack.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,460
Let's try it out.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:25,680
And here's a test post that has
a single quote in it, and sure enough,

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,200
that worked.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,520
Let's try the attack query again.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:37,090
Single quote, paren, semicolon, delete
from posts, semicolon, dash, dash.

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,110
And this time, we're successfully
treating that as just text and

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,910
not a piece of SQL.

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,770
Awesome.

13
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,790
With that simple change, we foiled one
of the most infamous security holes

14
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,260
a database-backed web app can have.

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,540
Just remember that whenever
you execute an insert query,

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,910
make sure to use query parameters
instead of string substitution.

17
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,080
In case you forget,

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,060
here's what the Psycopg 2 documentation
has to say on the matter.

19
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,760
Warning, never, never, never use
Python string concatenation, plus, or

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,110
string parameters interpolation,
percent,

21
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,340
to pass variables to an SQL query
string, not even at gunpoint.

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,309
And they give the same
format that we just used.

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,870
Now personally, I don't think we really
need to have documentation that tells us

24
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,360
what to do at gunpoint, but
we all do have a right to secure code.
