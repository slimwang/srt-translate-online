1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,770
Okay Michael. So, are you ready to give me a ranking

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,780
>> Yes, yes, I think I am.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,470
>> Okay, well, if you give me a ranking then.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,910
>> So, did you say one was the best.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,910
>> One is the best and three is the least best. Alright, so I

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,900
am really excited about the third cloud

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,790
structure. The third attribute to be split

8
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,210
on. Because, what it does. Is it takes all our x's and o's That

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,750
need to have different labels and it

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,930
puts them into two different buckets. One where

11
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,340
they all get to be red x's and the other where they all get to

12
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,360
be green o's. So I would say the far right one is ranked number one.

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,930
>> I would agree with you and in fact I would say that in fact we're done.

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,950
>> Yeah, it's perfect.

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,570
>> It is perfect, agreed. One is perfect. Or 3

16
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,630
is perfect in this case, because I gave it a one.

17
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,890
>> Alright, so then, I think the worst one is also

18
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,810
easy to pick, because if you look at the middle attribute,

19
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,400
the attribute that's shown in the middle, we take all the data, and we put

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,890
it all on the left. So we really have just kicked the can down the

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,050
road a little bit. There's nothing. That

22
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:07,020
this attribute splitting has done. So, I would

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,970
call that the worst possible thing you could

24
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,660
do. Which is to basically to do nothing.

25
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,220
>> No, I think that's right. and, in fact, it really is doing nothing.

26
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:16,730
>> Right.

27
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,640
>> Okay. So

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,190
what about the first attribute?

29
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,150
>> So, I'm going to put that at, you know,

30
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,130
if the first one is too hot and the middle

31
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,570
one is too cold, I would say this one is,

32
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,370
wait, no, no. [LAUGH] I was going down the Goldilocks

33
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,320
path. So, so this one is sort of in between.

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,570
In that it splits things so you have smaller sets

35
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,450
of data to deal with, but it hasn't really improved

36
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,230
our ability to tell the reds and the greens apart.

37
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:49,650
So in fact, I'd almost want to put this as three also but I'll put it as two.

38
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,360
>> Okay. I think an argument could be making it three. An argument could be

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,670
made for making it two. Your point is actually pretty good, right? We have eight

40
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,100
red things and eight green things up

41
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,560
here. And the kind of distribution between them,

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,840
sort of half red and, half red x's,

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,330
half green o's, we have the same distribution

44
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,500
after we go through this attribute here. So it does some

45
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,180
splitting, but it's still, well you still end up with half

46
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,120
red, half green, half x, half o. So, that's not a

47
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,510
lot of help, but it's certainly better than doing absolutely nothing.

48
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,960
>> Well is it though? I mean, it seems

49
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,810
it could also be the case. That what we've done

50
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,400
is that we're now splitting on that has provided

51
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,950
no valid information, and therefore can only contribute to overfitting.

52
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,420
>> That's that's a good point. That's a

53
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,420
good point. So, do you want to change your answer

54
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:34,780
to three?

55
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,980
>> I don't know, what did you want the answer to be? It seems

56
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,520
to me that the first one and the second one are just plain bad.

57
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,730
>> They are just plain bad. The question

58
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,550
is whether one is, more bad than the other.

59
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,500
>> I, I don't know. I don't know how to judge.

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,750
>> Well I'll tell you, I would accept

61
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,860
either two or a three as an answer here.

62
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,200
I think you can make an argument either

63
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,170
way. And I think you actually made both arguments.

64
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,270
>> That's very nice of you.

65
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,330
>> So.

66
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:54,670
>> Thank you.

67
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,170
>> You're very welcome. So this is perfect. This

68
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,560
is the House of Representatives and this is the Senate.

69
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,720
>> [LAUGH] What do you mean? They'reâ€¦ Oh. So, there you go. Okay.

70
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,220
>> [LAUGH] Not exactly sure what you mean,

71
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,460
but it seems somehow denigrating to our political system.

72
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,620
>> It is not at all denigrating. It is,

73
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,570
it is, I would call it incisive political satire.
