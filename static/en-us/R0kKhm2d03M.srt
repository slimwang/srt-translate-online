1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In the second situation, the front of the car will lower more when we brake.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
To see that, let's look at the center of mass.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In this situation, the center of the mass is put to the back of the car--may be it's here.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In this situation, it's put up--may be it's here. Now let's look at the forces due to friction and the levers.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We can see that in the second situation, the levers get longer

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and the angle between the forces and the levers is closer to perpendicular.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So there are two reasons for this car is pushed stronger in the clockwise fashion,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which means that its front lowers more.
