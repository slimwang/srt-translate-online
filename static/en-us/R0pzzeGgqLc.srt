A good way to validate your model's
ability to make a good forecast,

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,060
is to use a holdout sample.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,710
Holdout sample is a subset
of the time series,

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,510
usually the most recent data points,
that you withheld and

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,160
then used to check the accuracy
of predictions from your model.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,320
In our construction of the ETS and
ARIMA models from the previous lessons,

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,060
we withheld the last six months from
our time series from model validation.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,750
We then built the model
using the remaining data and

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,840
now we can test the results of the model
against the data in our holdout sample.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,190
This gives us actual observed
values to test against.

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,760
The size of the holdout sample will
depend on how long the time series is

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,110
and how far you would like to forecast.

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,320
Ideally, the size of the holdout sample
should be at least the amount of

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,680
periods you are forecasting for.
