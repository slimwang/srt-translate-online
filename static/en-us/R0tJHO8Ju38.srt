00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,468
Now we're going to build on our
understanding of boolean expressions to

2
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:05,849
create if else statements.

3
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:08,830
If else statements give us
the ability to branch, or

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,140
redirect, the execution of our
applications based on truth values.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,880
For example, if I'm thirsty I
might take a sip of this water.

6
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:19,779
Otherwise, maybe I'll eat
one of these candies.

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,230
That's just a simple case.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,231
By the end of this lesson we'll build
pretty complex logic using this concept.

00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:28,778
