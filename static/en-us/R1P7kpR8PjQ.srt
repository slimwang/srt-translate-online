1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,470
So now that we've, we've got together all the criteria, and the, first order

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:10,120
logic expression of things, let's go back to Property 2 for a moment.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,830
That requirement that the concrete implementation is consistent.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,390
Recall that this means that all operations preserve invariants.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,130
The relat, relevant invariant is that running total reflects the sum of

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,460
the transactions that have taken place.

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,410
So we have to make sure that each of the operations if that

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,509
invariant is true before hand, it's also we true, it is also true afterwards.

9
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,630
So the balance operation is not a problem because it doesn't effect the value if

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,560
the variables.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,540
For the other two we would need an inductive argument that the invariant is

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,300
initially true and that deposits and withdrawals keep it true.

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,740
This intern relies on the fact that the sum operation can be defined in terms of

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,730
re, repeated additions and subtractions.
