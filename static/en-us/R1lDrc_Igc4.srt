00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I want to describe this next result just because it just shows how weird

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
computational complexity results can be.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's think about the colorability of planar graphs. In particular, here's a decision problem.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We're given a graph G and a number K. Is planar graph G K colorable?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And let's look at how the difficulty of the question differs as we change K. So K is 1.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What kind of graphs are K colorable? Graphs with no edges.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So we can answer this question in constant time if the number of edges is greater than 0, no.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
As soon as there is a single edge, then you're going to need to two colors to color the nodes in that.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
All right. What if it's two? We want to know if this graph two colorable.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We'll you know this one already because two colorability is exactly the same as testing

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
whether the graph is bipartite and in the previous unit, you showed that that could be solved

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
with depth-first search and therefore, runs in big Î(n+m).

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In case three, well 3 colorability we showed was NP complete,

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
but we didn't do that for planar graphs, we did that for general graphs.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
but it turns out that you can actually introduce another gadget into the mix here

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
that actually let you deal with edge crossings.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So if you have a piece of the graph that looks like this and there's a crossing in it,

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
you can actually introduce some nodes here so that the information from this node travels along

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and gets to this node without ever having to cross another edge.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It becomes a planar graph. I didn't explain how to do this but it turns out to be true.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
A three coloring of planar graph isn't any easier

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
than three coloring in general graph, it's NP complete.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What about coloring a graph with four colors if its a planar graph.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Well, remarkably, the problems gotten harder and harder from constant to linear

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to basically it seems like it requires exponential time, it goes back to constant time,

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and that's because of the celebrated 4-color map theorem that says that any map

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
can be colored with four colors and in this particular case, any map can be translated

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
into a planar graph and so we know that every planar graph can be colored with four colors.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So the constant time algorithm for this problem is just to always say yes.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You give me a graph and tell me this is planar and I say, "Yup, it's four colorable,"

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and therefore, it's also going to be five, six, seven colorable because you can just use the first four.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So that's kind of cool. So one of the things to point out is that the peak of the hardness comes at K=3.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That actually shows up a lot in NP complete problems.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Usually if there's two of something that you have to choose from,

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
the problem is pretty easy because you can try one of them

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and if it doesn't work try the other one right away, but when if there's three,

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
you have to keep considering lots of different combinations of things and

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
the difficulty level really, really blows up.
