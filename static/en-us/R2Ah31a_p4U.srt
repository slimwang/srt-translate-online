1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,410
Network first tries to handle the
request by fetching from the network.

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,462
If the network requests fails or

3
00:00:07,462 --> 00:00:11,230
times out, it will try to fulfill
the request from the cache.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,840
This is the strategy to use for
basic read-through caching.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,720
It's also good to use for API requests
where you always want the freshest data

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,500
when it's available but would rather
have stale data than no data at all.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,470
This method does have its flaws though.

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,580
If the user has a intermittent or

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,680
slow connection, they'll have
to wait for the network to fail

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,080
before they'll get the perfectly
acceptable content from the cache.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,330
This can take an extremely long time and
is a frustrating user experience.

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,710
Network first is ideal for
content that is updated frequently and

13
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,420
not part of the app shell.

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,900
For example article content, social
media timelines, and game leaderboards.
