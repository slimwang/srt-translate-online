00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,850
Olivia bikes at e miles per hour and Terrance bikes at 4 miles per hour. Great

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,656
solving for getting these two correct. We start solving the equation by cross

3
00:00:09,656 --> 00:00:16,079
multiplying. So we'll have 30 times x equals x plus 4 times 15. Then we

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,646
distribute 15 to both of these terms to get 30 x equals 15 x plus 60. We

5
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:28,690
subtract 15 x from both sides to get 15 x equals 60. And finally, we take our

6
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:34,816
equation and we divide each side by 15 to get x is equal to 4. We know x really

7
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:40,186
represents Terrance's speed. So Terrance's speed is 4 miles per hour. Olivia

8
00:00:40,186 --> 00:00:45,362
bikes 4 miles per hour faster than Terrance. So we know she travels at 8 miles

9
00:00:45,362 --> 00:00:46,620
per hour.
