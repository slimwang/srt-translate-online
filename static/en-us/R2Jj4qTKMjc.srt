1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And the answer is, of course, that greedy would choose 12 vertices because it always

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
chooses the ones with which it could cover the most edges. So this one here,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
this one here, this one here, this one here, and so on.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And that is, of course, a total of 12 vertices.
