1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In equilibrium, we had to have a zero rate of change.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The temperature should be staying constant so there's three candidates.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The middle one is a little tricky. Actually, our function never becomes zero.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It jumps, but even if it was continuous, this point would constitute an unstable equilibrium.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If we are below the temperature of ignition, there is no fire and we simply lose heat

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and if we are above the temperature of ignition, there is fire and we gain heat.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This point would be unstable anyway. The lower equilibrium is stable.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If we are below the ambient temperature, we gain heat from the environment.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If we are above the ambient temperature, we lose heat at the environment. So no problem.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This is stable and the upper one is stable as well. Here we have combustion.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Combustion is going on.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If the temperature was a little lower, the rate of change of the temperature

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
would be positive--it would be moving up.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If the temperature was a little higher, the rate of change would be negative--we're moving down,

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
meaning at this point, we lose as much heat to the environment as we gain from combustion.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The answer is there's two stable equilibria.
