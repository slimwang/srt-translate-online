1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,620
You've got quite a few new tools in
your forms tool belt at this point.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,580
You've spent a lot of time thinking
about forms as a whole, so

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,920
I want you to put your skills
to the test with this check out.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:18,290
I'm going to give it to you in its
current state, which is a bit ugly.

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,560
This skeleton of a nice form is here but
that's about it.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,680
You can tell that there
are definitely way too many inputs.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,580
Clicking on the labels isn't working and

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,090
not to mention the color scheme
isn't really looking that great.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,690
What Iâ€™d like you to do is
turn this into a simple,

10
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,320
beautiful form using everything
that you've learned so far.

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,520
This is an open ended exercise in that
there's really no correct answer.

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,360
I want you to apply what you've
learned about inputs, labels,

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,610
simplification, auto completion,
validation and form design.

14
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,750
You may find that you can make some
small tweaks to improve this checkout,

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,090
or you may want to just blow it up and
start from scratch.

16
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,290
It's up to you.

17
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,470
In the next video, you'll see me discuss
two different versions of my check-out.

18
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,830
One will use native HTML elements,

19
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,080
while the other will take
advantage of Polymer.

20
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,610
Polymer includes a set of
elements called gold elements

21
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,960
that I found to be really
helpful with e-commerce.

22
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,190
As this is totally up to you to create,

23
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,000
feel free to take advantage of whatever
framework or library you like.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,330
Doesn't matter if that's Polymer,
Angular, React, or

25
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,900
something else entirely.

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,400
It's up to you.

27
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,960
The point of this quiz is to give you a
chance to think through a checkout flow

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,930
from start to finish.

29
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,980
I want you to make decisions and build
something that you're proud to show off.

30
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,690
I also want you to think mobile
first while you're designing.

31
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,520
You'll learn more about this in a bit.

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,100
But for now i just want you to do your
best to think about what it's like for

33
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,990
your mobile users first.

34
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,450
It'll be a big help.

35
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,485
Prioritizing for mobile devices
will only help simplify and

36
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:01,800
expedite your checkout flow.

37
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,660
When you're happy with your checkout,
share in the forums.

38
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,970
And while you're there,
peruse your classmate's forms and

39
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,650
give them some
constructive feedback too.

40
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,730
I'll leave a few helpful links for
you in the instructor notes.

41
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,000
When you're happy with your checkout and
ready to continue, check this box.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,780
Good luck.

43
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,370
I know you can do it.
