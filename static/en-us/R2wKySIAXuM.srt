1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:03,571
Out app can create
a notification on command.

2
00:00:03,572 --> 00:00:08,015
But that's not super useful, after all
the whole point of our hydration app is

3
00:00:08,015 --> 00:00:09,908
to remind us when to drink water.

4
00:00:09,907 --> 00:00:12,520
And it's supposed to issue these
reminders automatically without

5
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:14,275
requiring the user to
actually do anything.

6
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:15,451
So our end goal for

7
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:20,620
this notification here is to have
it shown every 15 minutes or so.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,050
These notifications should also only
show when the device is plugged in

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,820
like this, meaning that the user
is hopefully near a water source.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,760
We could easily do this using by
creating a scheduled service using

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,090
a class called Firebase JobDispatcher,
which you'll be learning about next.
