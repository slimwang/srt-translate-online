00:00:00,285 --> 00:00:03,905
Hi, I'm Sebastian,
I'm delighted to welcome you to

2
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:07,926
Udacity's Artificial Intelligence
Nano Degree program.

3
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:12,064
We think it provides
an experience unlike any other.

4
00:00:12,064 --> 00:00:16,623
AI is really about unleashing one of
the most amazing things in the entire

5
00:00:16,623 --> 00:00:18,429
universe, intelligence.

6
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:20,858
AI is growing exponentially.

7
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:26,435
And we've changed our world at the rate
with the fast to fast work by humans,

8
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:30,429
because AIs can learn
much faster than us.

9
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:32,728
Just look at self-driving cars.

10
00:00:32,728 --> 00:00:36,030
Anytime you drive,
only one person gets better.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,670
You.

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:41,100
But with AI, anytime an AI car drives,
all cars get better,

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,050
including all future unborn cars.

14
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:48,159
After completing this program, you'll
be positioned to take full advantage

15
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,844
of such changes that AI will usher in.

16
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:55,200
You will be ready to work with
trans-disciplinary thinkers and

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,700
practitioners to create technologies
that will shape our future world.
