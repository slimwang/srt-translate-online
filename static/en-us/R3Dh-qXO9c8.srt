1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,042
Step 3, allocate space to store the new frontier.

2
00:00:03,042 --> 00:00:05,530
So we have an empty array where we can copy the new frontier,

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,976
but each node needs to know where in that array

4
00:00:07,976 --> 00:00:10,034
it might copy its edge list.

5
00:00:10,034 --> 00:00:12,562
We covered this operation in unit 4; it's called...
