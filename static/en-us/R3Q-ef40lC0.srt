1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,340
Also what we did was we looked at different types of filtering mechanisms.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,250
So here I want to be able to take a box filter.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,940
In this one I'm showing a 21 by 21 box filter with uniform values and

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,900
we can apply that to smoothing of an image.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,420
If you look at this part of the image here.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,850
And you sense, basically, you see a flat, gray kernel.

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,110
And, if you look at it in a height map that we've looked at it basically it's

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,850
got a fixed value just like this.

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,310
And that basically is now our average or a box filter.

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,320
Let's look at how we would apply a box filter to an original image like this,

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,520
the pepper's image.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,678
Again, it's the flat kernel.

13
00:00:37,678 --> 00:00:41,345
When applied you get a blurry image.

14
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:43,372
This is a 21 by 21 kernel.

15
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:47,386
The linear combination of the weights here with the linear,

16
00:00:47,386 --> 00:00:53,180
with the constant values of the box here, result in a rather blurry image.

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,680
Notice again, this is a flat kernel or a box filter.
