00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,660
Let's put an end to this spam nonsense.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,540
We need to make sure that the data
in the content column will always be

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,050
treated as having the same meaning,
as text, not as JavaScript code.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,770
As it turns out,
there's a really good Python library for

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,740
doing this called bleach.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,690
It's installed on your VM already, so
you can import it right into your code.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,910
Have a read through
the bleach documentation,

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,160
which is linked in the instructor notes.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,120
Once you do that, you can use bleach
to stop unsafe HTML from ever

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,480
getting from an attacker through
your database back to a user.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,610
Go ahead and
make that change to the forum code,

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,090
but here's something to think about
when you do, do you think it would be

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,720
better to clean bad stuff out of posts
before we store them in the data base?

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,470
Or should we store whatever
the user sends us and

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,520
then clean the bad stuff out before
we display those posts in the forum?
