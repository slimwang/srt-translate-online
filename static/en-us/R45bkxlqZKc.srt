00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I would say approximately linear--if you go to the barchart, you'll find that these bars

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
kind of nicely lined up almost like a line with an exception that over here it levels off a little bit.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Linear seems to be a good guess as to what's happening--wage increases linearly with age.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The reason why it's not exact is more obvious from this scatter plot which shows the raw data.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You can see even with higher ages around 40, they're still individuals that earned

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
relatively little money--so for the data to be linear, we get these to line up exactly

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
on the straight line which is not the case in this data.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On average, the relationship might be linear, but when it comes

9
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to the exact data points, it's clearly not linear.
