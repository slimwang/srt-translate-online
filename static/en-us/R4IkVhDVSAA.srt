1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,100
I expect that no one of you found every one of these defects.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,650
But that, the class as a whole noticed most or all of these problems.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,570
I also expect that some of you have noticed problems that are not on the list.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,110
The point is that groups do better than individuals.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,309
This is sometimes called the many eyes phenomenon.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,940
There's a cost, however.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,190
If 200 people each look at 13 lines of code for

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,360
15 minutes, this amounts to more than one week of staff time.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,180
At current loaded salary rates, this might cost a company thousands of dollars.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,050
Is it worth it to a company to spend that much money to find these problems?

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,730
Would a smaller group size have worked just as well?

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,140
Would more time per person have worked better?

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,960
Notice also that there were all kinds of defects.

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,400
I intentionally didn't tell you in advance what the word defect meant,

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,740
but here there were bugs.

16
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,870
There were documentation issues.

17
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,860
There were inefficiencies, and there were even violations of coding standards.

18
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,370
Software engineers have studied defect detection and

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,700
concluded that team review efforts can be cost effective way to find defects.

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,500
However, the reviews must be done in a systematic fashion.
