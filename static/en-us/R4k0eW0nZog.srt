00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,484
>> We can think of negative x over 8 as x divided by negative 8, since the

2
00:00:03,484 --> 00:00:07,393
negative sign can go either with the numerator or the denominator. It just

3
00:00:07,393 --> 00:00:11,420
belongs to the fraction as a whole. That means to get x by itself, you just need

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,050
to multiply both sides by negative 8. On the left side, that leaves us with x.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:21,059
On the right side, we have negative 16. But, just like before, we have to flip

6
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:26,067
the sign direction. We get x is less than negative 16. As always, I'm going to

7
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:30,826
check my solution with a number line. X is less than 16 is this region over

8
00:00:30,826 --> 00:00:35,593
here. Let's pick one value inside this region, and see if it satisfies this

9
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:40,188
inequality. Negative 20 is over there, so negative 20 over negative 8 is just 5

10
00:00:40,188 --> 00:00:44,445
over 2, or 2 and a half. 2 and a half is greater than 2, so we're good on that.

11
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:48,924
Now let's pick one value to the right, in the region where values that we plug

12
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:53,497
in should not satisfy this inequality. I'll pick zero, since it's always my

13
00:00:53,497 --> 00:00:58,344
favorite number to pick. Zero divided by anything, including negative 8, is just

14
00:00:58,344 --> 00:01:02,625
equal to zero. And zero is not greater than two, so this also confirms our

15
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:07,209
solution set. So we can see that whether we divide or we multiply both sides of

16
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:11,185
an inequality by a negative number, we have to switch the sign of the

17
00:01:11,185 --> 00:01:15,900
inequality. Remember, division and multiplication are very, very intimately

18
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,385
linked.
