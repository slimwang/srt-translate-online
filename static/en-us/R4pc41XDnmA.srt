Awesome.

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,980
There were a lot of attributes
that you can configure by XML, and

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,230
it's important to understand them.

00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,890
I would also suggest taking some time
to look around the forums and try and

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,960
write some code to start your
map in one of the location, and

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,850
configurations someone else has chosen.

7
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,170
They may have found
something really cool.
