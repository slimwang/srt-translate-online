00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,580
You know, it's really hard to make a drawing stand out,

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,050
if it's only in black and white.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,710
We can change the colors of fills and

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,190
strokes by using these two, fillStyle and strokeStyle.

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,600
We can call fillStyle on the canvas context and in this case,

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,200
we're going to set it to blue.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,620
You can use a name color.

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,730
There are a 140 name colors, according to the HTML specification.

9
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,970
And you can learn more about them in the instructor notes.

10
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,110
Or you can use a hexadecimal color.

11
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,940
So in this case we're setting the stroke style color to 33CC33.

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,660
And we're calling it on the canvas.

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,860
Hopefully these two should add some color to our drawing over here.

14
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,940
Let's find out.

15
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,320
I will save it.

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,620
I will come over here and hit Refresh.

17
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,730
And we see that in fact the fill actually did become blue.

18
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,910
Our triangle is now blue, which is pretty cool,

19
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,850
but it looks like strokeStyle here didn't have an effect.

20
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,790
This hexadecimal color should be a shade of green, but

21
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,700
we don't see any green over.

22
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,880
And that's because, fillStyle and strokeStyle.

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,150
Only applied to the fills and strokes that come after them, inside your script.

24
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,840
So in this case because we're calling fill,

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,420
after we set fillStyle, we have a nice blue triangle.

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,510
But because we drew our stroke rectangle,

27
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,180
well before we set the strokeStyle it didn't get affected.

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,450
Let's go ahead and change that.

29
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,950
So now we set the strokeStyle to this color before the rectangle.

30
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,400
And we should see green rectangle instead.

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,700
So let's save our script, come over to the browser and

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,240
hit Refresh, and now the rectangle has a nice, light green outline.
