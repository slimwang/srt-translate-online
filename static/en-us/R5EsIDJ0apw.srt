1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,810
Once you've looked at some
of the surprising points,

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,620
it's time to fix any
problems that you find.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,360
Of course, you won't always see
the problem at first glance so

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,790
more investigation may be necessary.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,340
Often though, you will find a problem or

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,030
two just by looking at some of
the surprising points, or you might find

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,190
that there actually wasn't even
a problem in the first place.

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,900
In this case, I saw that a student had
cancelled within one day of joining,

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,850
and that's not really a problem, and

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,540
it does explain why that student was
missing from the engagement table.

11
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,410
This is a good thing to be aware of,
though.

12
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,220
Depending on the analysis I do later,

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,520
I might want to exclude students like
this, or I might just need to know these

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,860
students exist in case they
cause an edge case in my code.

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,800
At this point, the process repeats.

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,320
Once again, I need to identify any
remaining surprising data points.

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,640
Of course there might not be any more
surprises at this point, since a student

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,320
who cancels the same day as they
joined no longer counts as surprising.

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,470
But it's still important to check
in case there are other problems I

20
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,200
haven't found yet.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,910
Go ahead and

22
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,900
figure out whether there are any
surprising enrollment records left.

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,129
That is, rows in the enrollment
table where the student is missing

24
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,250
from the engagement table but
they stayed enrolled, at least a day.

25
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,950
Enter the number of surprising
records you find in this box.

26
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,730
It could be zero.
