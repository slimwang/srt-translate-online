00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,440
Let's do one more. Have you ever left your house with your umbrella thinking

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,533
it's going to rain but then it doesn't? And then you just end up carrying your

3
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:11,596
umbrella around all day? Let's say that the null hypothesis is that it's not

4
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:16,416
going to rain and the alternative hypothesis is that it will rain. Now we're

5
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:20,676
going to do kind of the opposite from what we did the last quiz. This time,

6
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:26,538
decide which of these correspond to rejecting the null or retaining the null.

7
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:32,110
Or, if the null true or the null is false.. Write A, B, C, or D in each of

8
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:37,990
these boxes. Just to clarify a little more, if the null is true, which of

9
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:44,232
these, A, B, C, or D, corresponds to that. If we decided to retain each H

10
00:00:44,232 --> 00:00:48,750
naught, in other words we decided that it's not going to rain, which one of

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,294
these, A, B, C, or D, should go in this box?
