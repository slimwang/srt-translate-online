00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,260
>> So part of the point of looking at these two different kinds of concepts is

2
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,030
that depending on the different kinds of concepts we are dealing with right now,

3
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,870
you may come up with a different knowledge representation and

4
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,680
a different inference method. Let me explain.

5
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,960
Supposing we're dealing with concepts like Foo or Holiday or Inspirational.

6
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,370
Then the case-based reasoning method might be a very good method for

7
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,230
dealing with things of that kind. We may have experience with specific holidays,

8
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:48,780
but we cannot abstract them out into a concept with prototypical conditions.

9
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,880
On the other hand, if we were dealing with concepts like a right triangle or

10
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,930
a reptile, for which we can define necessary and sufficient conditions,

11
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:01,540
in that case there are alternative methods available that might be more suitable

12
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,580
then case-based reasoning. So instead of thinking in terms of one method that is

13
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,660
going to work for all conditions and all concepts, we might want to think in

14
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,580
terms of a array of methods, where each method is more or

15
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,710
less useful for different kind of conditions or different kind of concepts.

16
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:23,640
David, I am sure you recall mentally who was a Russian chemist who came up with

17
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,730
the basic notion of the chemical periodic table. I'm sure all the students in

18
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,100
the class know about the chemical periodic table, which organizes all

19
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,290
the elements according to certain properties like hydrogen, oxygen, calcium, and

20
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,330
so on. Now, Mendeleev came up with this notion of a chemical periodic table, and

21
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,580
in some sense what we're trying to do in this course is to build a similar kind

22
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,300
of periodic table, except that this is a periodic table of the elements of mind.

23
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,236
It's a periodic table of the basic fundamental elements that compose

24
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:56,340
intelligence. Instead of talking about elements and valances and atoms and

25
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,710
so on, what we are going to be talking about are methods and

26
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,530
representations. So it as if we are discovering the fundamental knowledge for

27
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,800
presentations and organizations and reasoning methods that go with it.

28
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,860
Case based reasoning was one. Reasoning method that went with certain kinds of

29
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,275
concepts that are hard to abstract and

30
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:18,770
into conditions, like typical conditions, are necessarily logical conditions.
