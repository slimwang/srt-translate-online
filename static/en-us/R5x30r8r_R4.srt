00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,120
Let's look at how firewalls should
be deployed to protect a network.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,630
Here's a figure that illustrates
a common firewall configuration, that

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:13,150
includes an additional network between
the external and internal firewalls.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,250
An external firewall is placed at
the edge of the local area network,

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,390
just inside the boundary router.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,150
The boundary router connects
the complete network to the Internet.

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:28,040
One or more internal firewalls protect
the bulk of the enterprise network.

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,860
Between the external firewall and the
internal firewall is typically the DMZ,

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,150
systems that are externally accessible,
but

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,620
need some protections
are usually located in the DMZ.

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,330
These systems require or
foster external connectivity, such as

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,320
the public facing corporate web server,
an email server, and a DNS server.

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,060
The external firewall provides some
basic or first line defense, but

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,540
allows access to these
public facing systems.

15
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,810
The internal firewall provides
additional protection.

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,990
In particular, it protects traffic from
a DMZ to the internal trusted network.
