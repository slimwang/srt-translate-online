1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,190
Now that we've created the set
of states, let's designate

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,500
one of the states in our domain to
be the initial state for the MDP.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,930
At the moment, we haven't defined
any transitions between states.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,010
So our choice of an initial
state is arbitrary.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,280
But for grading purposes,
let's call State 0 the initial state.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,220
Here I added in initState; field which
has the type of the Burlap object state.

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,700
Now let's initialize this
field in our constructor.

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,900
Take a look at the Burlap documentation
for graph defined domain again.

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,600
Using this documentation I'd
like you to fill in the blank

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,460
in this new line of code.

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,430
So that it initializes this.initState to

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,740
the 0th state in the domain
we created earlier.

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,044
Using this.dg.generateDomain();
