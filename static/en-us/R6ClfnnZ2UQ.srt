This question is really just asking us to use our common sense. Does is make

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:09,563
sense that Grant will make money if he doesn't sell any products? I would argue

3
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:14,247
no. If no one buys his products, he won't get any money back. And since he put

4
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:18,994
money into making them, he'll be at a loss. And fortunately we have a positive

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,990
y-intercept, not a negative one. So, this means this is positive profit. So, the

6
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:28,876
information from our equation is not really in line with what we would think

7
00:00:28,888 --> 00:00:33,909
logically would happen. So, I would say that the two points that Grant gave us

8
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:39,064
to start out, which you may remember were 60, 1000. And 100, 1200 were probably

9
00:00:39,076 --> 00:00:43,784
off. We based our entire equations just off the info we got from these two

10
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:48,265
points to help us figure out our slope, and our y-intercept. So, this just goes

11
00:00:48,277 --> 00:00:51,934
to show you that if your initial data is wrong, your final conclusion will

12
00:00:51,946 --> 00:00:55,495
probably not make very much sense. I think this is also testament to the

13
00:00:55,507 --> 00:00:59,434
importance of being able to connect math with real world situations. And why we

14
00:00:59,446 --> 00:01:03,240
have to keep ourselves grounded in what our variables mean when we're solving

15
00:01:03,252 --> 00:01:03,697
problems.
