1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,486
Since we know that our area needs to be less than or equal to 750 square feet.

2
00:00:04,486 --> 00:00:09,036
We can just replace area on the left side of this inequality with the other way

3
00:00:09,036 --> 00:00:13,407
we know how to express it, length times width. And then, plugin those side

4
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:18,117
lengths using these quantities down here. So the new length, of Grant's booth,

5
00:00:18,117 --> 00:00:22,733
will be 20 feet, the original 20 feet, plus x, the amount that he's adding on.

6
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:28,064
So we have 20 plus x and then that's multiplying it by the new width, which will

7
00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:33,101
be 15 plus x. This quantity will be the new area, which we know must be less

8
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:36,328
than or equal to 750. So here's our inequality.
