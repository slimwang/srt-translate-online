00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,841
>> So remember, this was the data set from the general population distribution.

2
00:00:04,841 --> 00:00:09,657
Now let's find the standard deviation of our sample of social networkers, and

3
00:00:09,657 --> 00:00:14,609
compare it to this standard deviation. Notice how when we did this, we were very

4
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:19,619
organized. We found the mean, we found the deviations from mean, we squared each

5
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,133
deviation, we took the average And then we took the square root, to get the

6
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:29,130
standard deviation. So finally, find the standard deviation, of this sample, of

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,424
size 10, and of people with the social network. We're going to ignore Mark

8
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:38,192
Zuckerberg, he's no longer part of our sample. I recommend you organize it like

9
00:00:38,192 --> 00:00:42,656
we did before, where you have a column of the deviations, and a column of the

10
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:47,068
squared deviations. This is going to take you awhile, especially because it's

11
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:51,520
probably your first time calculating the standard deviation by hand. So take

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,790
your time, because the important thing is that you really understand how to do

13
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,372
it, and what it is. And when you're done, put your answer here.
