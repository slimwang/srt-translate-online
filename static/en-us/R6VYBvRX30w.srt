00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,835
To solve this one, the three elements you need to determine are the axis, angle

2
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:09,301
of rotation and the sign. In other words, which direction you're rotating. The

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:13,955
green axis is the one we want to rotate around, and so this is the y axis. For

4
00:00:13,955 --> 00:00:18,348
the angle of rotation, there are 360 degrees in a circle. We want to rotate 2

5
00:00:18,348 --> 00:00:23,204
12ths of the way around the circle. So that's 60 degrees. We also need to rotate

6
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:28,202
in a negative direction, since the positive direction is counter clockwise. So

7
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:33,523
the sign is negative here. All this information is encapsulated in this line of

8
00:00:33,523 --> 00:00:38,052
code, y rotation, negative 60 degrees. There's more than one solution to this

9
00:00:38,052 --> 00:00:42,688
problem. Since we can't tell which end is which. We could instead rotate 120

10
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:47,400
degrees counter clockwise and get the same answer, which would let us put a

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,513
positive angle.
