When I Google search ORM for
Python I get over 14

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,670
million results with several
different ORM options we could use.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,320
The first result that showed
up when I searched was for

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,910
an application called SQL Alchemy.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,820
SQL Alchemy is an open source ORM for
Python with a slew of features.

00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,300
Not to mention this awesome
Getting Started tutorial.

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,230
There's a lot of
information on this page.

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,610
But let's just focus on setting up
our database and tables for now.

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,480
If you're using the Vagrantfile,

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,620
SQLAlchemy is already installed
on your virtual machine.

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,050
If you are not using Vagrant,

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,970
you can install SQLAlchemy from
the link below to follow along.
