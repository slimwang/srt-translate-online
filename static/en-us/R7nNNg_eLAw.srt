00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,330
So far,
we've been drawing static images.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,500
But in a game, we want things
to be flying all over the place.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,860
To make things move, we need to
know how to keep track of time.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,210
We'll also learn more about
the LibGDX game architecture, and

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,320
how we can set up a game that
has multiple different screens.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,960
Finally, we'll learn how to fake
some very basic physics, so

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,970
we can make objects move
in a more realistic way.
