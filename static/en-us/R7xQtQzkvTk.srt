1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,430
So, as a reminder, this is what our training data looked like.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,210
It's the same terrain data that we had in the last one.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,710
And we're trying to figure out whether you can go fast or

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,890
you have to go slow on this terrain.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,480
So with that, I'm going to head back over to Google.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,400
I know that I want to use scikit-learn and support vector machine.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,520
All right, so we've lots of options here.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,288
Let's just jump right in.

9
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:22,890
We'll click on the first one.

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,650
Okay, so support vector machines, scrolling through a little bit,

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,800
the first thing that I see is there's some advantages and

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,170
disadvantages to support vector machines.

13
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,380
So, that's pretty interesting.

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,490
Those might be points that I'll, we'll revisit a little bit later in the class,

15
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,640
but I am impatient and I want to start coding.

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,220
So, the first thing it gives me, classification.

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,080
Fantastic, and I can see that there is already example code that's ready to go.

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,420
So, let's find this example code.

19
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,800
okay, this is starting to look a little bit familiar now.

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,810
So, I have my import statement, I have my training features,

21
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:02,119
and I have my training labels, like I did in a last example with naive Bayes.

22
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,160
I create my classifier.

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:11,040
I fit it using my, my training features and my training labels, and

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,770
then down here, they have us they show us how to do a prediction.

25
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:20,130
So as you can see, it's actually exactly the same few lines of code.

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,020
Only instead of now saying Gaussian Naive Bayes or

27
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,860
whatever, I'm calling it an SVC.

28
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,690
And this is one of the things that's really nice about scikit-learn,

29
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,640
is that basically all the classifiers that we'll be looking at and

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,610
all the classifiers that you might use sort of on your own in the future

31
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,510
will follow this same pattern, where you import it, you create it,

32
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,140
you fit it, and you make predictions.

33
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,840
And it's always going to be the same syntax.
