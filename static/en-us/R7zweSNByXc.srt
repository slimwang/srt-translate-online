00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,270
One way of coping with scale, is to

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,614
introduce hierarchy. OSPF has a notion of areas, and

3
00:00:05,614 --> 00:00:09,260
ISIS has an analogous notion of levels. In a

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,330
backbone network, the network's routers may be divided into

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,470
levels, or areas. And the backbone, itself, may

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,590
have its own area. In OSPF, the backbone area

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,420
is called area zero, and each area in the

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,610
backbone that's not in area zero has an area

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,310
zero router. The area zero routers perform

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,180
shortest path computation. And the routers in

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,160
each of the other areas independently perform

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,010
shortest path computation. Now paths are computed by

13
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:45,310
computing the shortest path within an area. Or, if the path must leave an area,

14
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,060
it's computed by stitching together the shortest

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,100
path to the area zero backbone router, and

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,780
then the shortest path across area

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,978
zero, followed by another intra-area shortest path.
