1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's the answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The chief financial officer is more than likely the economic buyer.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The saboteur might actually be the existing business intelligence group

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
inside of IT or the CIO's department

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
who is actually trying to already build the software,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and they might be afraid they're going to lose their jobs,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so in every major organization you might find people

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
who actually don't want or actively attempt to block a sale.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The CIO is more than likely the decision maker.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In some organizations they can actually sign off on large deals,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but in this case the chief information officer

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
is actually going to recommend to the chief financial officer

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that they buy this software.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The report users, the people who actually use the product,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
in this case they're just simply the influencers,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and that's kind of interesting to remember because

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
sometimes those entrepreneurs, we forget that the people

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
who use our product are not necessarily

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
the people who even pay for or even recommend the product,

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and in this case the recommenders were probably

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
the line of business management, that is, those users

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
worked for a line of business, a division or a department,

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and the influencers, the people who used it, said to their bosses

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
"We'd really like to have this software."

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
"This would work great."

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And their managers, who didn't have any signature authority

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
or couldn't actually install software, recommended that

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
this actually get bought.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Understanding this ecosystem is really important

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
not only in business to business sales but sometimes

31
00:01:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
business to consumer sales as well.
