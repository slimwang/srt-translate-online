1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,510
To better understand and apply these
methods, we'll examine a business

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,210
problem surrounding how management at
Bates Hotel, a mountain resort walking

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,120
distance from the best slopes in town,
are able to prepare for

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,150
their year by forecasting the number of
room bookings they expect each month.

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,870
This information can help management
make informed decisions on staffing,

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,548
hospitality arrangements,
and pricing for rooms.

7
00:00:20,548 --> 00:00:24,470
They have tasked their business
analysts, you, to forecast bookings so

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,490
they can make the necessary
preparations.

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,210
Historical bookings data contains
monthly data from the past ten years,

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,326
and the forecast should contain monthly
bookings for the next six months.

11
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:38,387
Your job will to be use to the
historical bookings data from years past

12
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:40,846
to one, investigate and clean the data.

13
00:00:40,846 --> 00:00:44,649
Two, determine trend and
seasonal components, three,

14
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:48,063
apply findings to an ARIMA and
ETS model in Alteryx,

15
00:00:48,063 --> 00:00:51,490
lastly, forecast bookings for
the next 6 months.

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,510
That's quite a lot to think about.

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,380
But don't worry, we'll be taking
a closer look at time series

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,040
forecasting methods and
what they all mean.

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,520
First let's take a quick quiz to
review what makes a set of data

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,660
a time series data set.
