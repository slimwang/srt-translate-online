00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,330
Alright, so to get started showing you soem of the performance

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,840
techniques in Chrome Dev Tools, I want you to load up

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,140
the Dev Tools bar, and also check out this great HTML-5

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,650
game called Biolab Disaster. Now, I love this game. It's made

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,540
with a fantastic framework called Impact JS. And, happens to be

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,980
a lot of the motivation on how we did the Grits

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,920
Code Base back in the other course. Now, let's take a

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,860
look at what we have here. When we talk about performance,

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,010
we always talk about three pillars of performance. Network, render,

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,210
and compute. What we are going to talk today first

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,930
is the Network pillar. In order to get an understanding

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,010
of how your web application is loading, what resources are coming

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,610
down to the wire. And how long it's taking, but

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,690
first thing you need to do is open up the network

15
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,650
tab in Chrome Dev Tools. This is a fantastic GEM

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,430
and treasure trove of information.

17
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,180
Because basically, this actually records every

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,575
request that your web application is making to the server

19
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:58,040
enlisted here with a lot of very valid information. For example,

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,640
you can see what type it is, the status of

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,180
the request The content, how long it took to get it,

22
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,650
and when it came in in the overall request structure

23
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,080
of your entire loading sequence. Now, we could spend an entire

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,160
Udacity course actually going into the nuances of this tool

25
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,200
and how to use it, but instead I want to focus

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,900
on a couple Key things. First off, when you're talking

27
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,640
about loading web applications on mobile devices, there's two things

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,580
you need to worry about. The first is how many

29
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,700
requests you're actually making. So for instance, if you scroll down

30
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,080
for playbiolab.com, you can actually see that there's a lot

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,560
of assets that are being loaded here. Right? Every time

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,130
your phone has to grab one of these assets off

33
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,140
the Internet, a lot of things occur, but most importantly is,

34
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,530
it takes time away from loading your application. Mainly because the

35
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,390
medium to retrieve the data is a little bit slower than just

36
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,010
loading it, say, off the memory or off of the disk.

37
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,450
Now, the second thing you need to be concerned about is actually

38
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,490
the size of the content that you're trying to load. So

39
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,870
if you go over here to the size button, and you actually

40
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,710
click on it twice, it's actually going to sort all of the assets

41
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,330
that you requested by their size. Now, notice right here, this top

42
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,669
one actually has two megabytes. Now look at

43
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,480
That's a single OG file. Of course that's going to

44
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,580
be music. But basically that's two megabytes that

45
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,490
has to be downloaded before this web application could

46
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,370
be played. Now, did you know that according

47
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,105
to http archive, the average website size is only

48
00:02:25,105 --> 00:02:28,290
1.1 megabytes? So already this single asset is

49
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,600
larger than most of the websites on the web.

50
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,550
Listen, that's not going to help you load this on your mobile device

51
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,830
any faster. So by sorting it by size you can get a great

52
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,200
sense of what assets you have, what sizes they are and see the

53
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,580
relative proportion on how long it takes those assets to actually be loaded.
