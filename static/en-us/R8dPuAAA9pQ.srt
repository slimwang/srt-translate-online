00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,110
Welcome to problem set 1, we are going to be going over the running time today

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:09,090
and what it means for an algorithm to be efficient or slow or difficult.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,010
So we're going to be going over few problems along those lines

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,570
so I will go ahead and just typewrite it.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:21,900
So let's say we consider ourselves more practical engineers than theoretical scientist.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,080
So we're somewhere over here maybe.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,000
So we don't really want to look at algorithm code and try to figure out the running times

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,840
instead what we rather do is implement the algorithms and then measure them,

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,120
measure the running times of the algorithm for just some random instances let's say of various sizes

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,810
and see where things go.

11
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:51,930
So let's take a look at the three algorithms called alpha, beta, and gamma in this table.

12
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,400
And we're running them on different input sizes.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:01,040
An input size of 100, 200, 300, and 400, and we're showing the running times.

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,080
Now, this is just for one run of each of these algorithms.

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:13,110
Let's say we're running each of these algorithms a million times on a random input of the given size

16
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:19,890
so running alpha a million times on an input size of 100

17
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,980
and different randomly generated inputs of size 100,

18
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,040
and it is taking an average of 25, and all these are in minutes.

19
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:37,040
And similarly for an input size of 200, we're running alpha a million times on random inputs of size 200,

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,820
and it's taking an average 317,000 minutes so you can see a growth somewhat quickly.

21
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,940
We can ask a number of questions about these three algorithms.

22
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,830
The first question I would like to ask is what is the running time for each algorithm,

23
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,870
alpha, beta, and gamma, based on the information in this table.

24
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:01,530
And you might be a little bit confused here because if alpha has linear running time

25
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,960
then it also has polynomial and exponential running time since those are worse than linear running time.

26
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,080
And similarly, if beta has polynomial running time then it's also exponential running time,

27
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,060
but it's not linear running time then.

28
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:22,920
Don't worry too much about that just give the lowest running time you can for each algorithm

29
00:02:22,920 --> 99:59:59,999
and check which one applies for each of the algorithms.
