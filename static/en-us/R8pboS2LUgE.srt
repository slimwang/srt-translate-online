00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,969
I've created a sample project
in angular using Yeoman.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,050
The link for
this project is in the instructor notes.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,100
To complete this quiz, you have to
take this hard coded template and

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,920
change it so
that it gets its data from a controller.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,630
So you'll need to create
a brick controller and

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,000
add it to the module, add the controller
to the template with the name brick,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,440
add properties to the controller
with the data from this template,

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,910
replace these hard coded
values in the template

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,490
with expressions that get their
value from the controller.

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,910
In the end, nothing will look different
in the browser, but that's okay.

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,620
The app will now get its starting
data from the controller.

12
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,680
When you finish setting
everything up correctly,

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,660
the feedback extension
will give you a code.

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,830
Enter that code on the next page.
