00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:04,748
To begin, let's take a look at
this simple, unstyled webpage.

2
00:00:04,748 --> 00:00:06,655
Looks pretty plain, doesn't it?

3
00:00:06,655 --> 00:00:09,090
Wouldn't it be better if we
could add some style to it?

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,750
Maybe we could lay out the content
differently, use a different font, or

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,040
emphasize different elements.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,750
CSS can help us do just that.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,261
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets,
is the markup language that we use

8
00:00:23,261 --> 00:00:26,678
to describe how elements
on websites should look.

9
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:29,458
CSS is all about style.

10
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,580
Look at YouTube's home page.

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,250
With CSS,
it can control things like color,

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,310
spacing, fonts, and
layouts for their website.

13
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,130
What makes CSS so
powerful is it gives you,

14
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,890
the web developer, the ability to change
the look of elements on the page.

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,170
CSS is also nice because it lets us
separate the description of the content

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,170
we want on the page, the HTML,

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,150
from the description of how we want the
content to look on the page, the CSS.

18
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,780
Let's look at an example.

19
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,510
This is Yahoo's home page, but what if I
looked at Yahoo's home page without CSS?

20
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,210
What would it look like?

21
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,770
Whoa, looks pretty weird, doesn't it?

22
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,930
The content is still here,
but it looks terrible.

23
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,910
What happened to the navigation
at the top, the menu on the side,

24
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,030
the search bar, and the news stories?

25
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,290
Well, this is the beauty of CSS.

26
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,690
Literally all the code that makes
the page look the way it does

27
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:32,320
is separate from the text, images,
and content that is on the page.

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,330
If I add the CSS back, then we're back
to the same Yahoo home page from before.
