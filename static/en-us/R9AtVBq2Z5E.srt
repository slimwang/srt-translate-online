1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,960
I chose to do a general programming
question because we definitely want to

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,490
see that she's able to code, for one.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,980
It's very important that she has
this general coding skills and

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,560
that is why we test little bit
of basic SQL understanding and

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,120
also basic byte on scripting.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,588
And both programming questions
just aim to do exactly that.

7
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:25,820
The first SQL question is
a very basic question which

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,712
just test general knowledge the SQL and
there's not there's not very much to it.

9
00:00:29,712 --> 00:00:32,570
Just want you see to be
able to get to a solution.

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,200
The second question which involved
a finding the maximum difference in a in

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,300
a list of integers.

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,310
It has two purposes write one to
test general by conscripting and

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:48,880
the other one is to help to see how
you think again like like everything.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,360
I think I Shirley did a great job

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,260
in both of them the first one she just
knew of the bad leg that we expected.

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,210
In the second one, she did something
that is very important as a candidate.

17
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,260
There many ways to solve
a problem usually when you get

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,550
a programming question.

19
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,160
You really just want to go ahead and
get to a solution first.

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,040
They, she knew

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,430
that the solution she had come up with
wasn't the most optimal solution and.

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,700
She recognizes of the better equipped
recognize this off the bat but it went.

23
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,080
Went ahead and wrote it, which is
exactly what you're supposed to do, you

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,870
can say this is the first thing I came
up with and then you go ahead and do it.

25
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,780
And that is completely acceptable,

26
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,080
I definitely don't expect her to come
up with the most optimal solution

27
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,490
in 10 seconds and
that along with me staring at her.

28
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,170
So I think she did a very good
job in answering that question.
