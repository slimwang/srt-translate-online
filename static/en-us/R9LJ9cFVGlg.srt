00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,097
To make sure we have our rational function written in simplest form, I'd like

2
00:00:03,097 --> 00:00:06,121
you to cancel out any common factors that are shared by the numerator and the

3
00:00:06,121 --> 00:00:11,308
denominator, then write the simplified form of the function right here. Note

4
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:14,636
that I've still included our domain restrictions here, which means we won't

5
00:00:14,636 --> 00:00:19,152
lose any information, even if we cancel out some factors. I also would like you

6
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:22,142
to make sure that in this final form down here, there's no constant factor left

7
00:00:22,142 --> 00:00:27,058
in the denominator. I'd like the only constant factor to be in the numerator.
