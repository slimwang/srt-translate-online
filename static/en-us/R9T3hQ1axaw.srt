1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer I was looking for is

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
shard the database.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You wouldn't replicate the database

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
because if it won't fit on one machine, it's probably not going to fit

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
on the next machine, and it still doesn't solve the machine we're talking about.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Get a bigger hard disk--well, that is technically true,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but if you put this,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you did not get the correct answer.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Shard the database--that's what we just talked about.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That allows you to take your data and spread it across

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
multiple machines, where each machine is storing just a piece of the data.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Take your data and spread it across multiple machines.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's what sharding a database is.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Or you could store less data.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You can delete some data from your database and of course it will fit,

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
or you can use Mongo and it will do it for you.
