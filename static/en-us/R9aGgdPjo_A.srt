00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,830
Take some time now to get your own
app to the point tha we just showed.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,420
You'll need to do the following steps.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,580
First, create the app.

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,189
Then, edit the layout, and

5
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:13,023
remember the layout code that I used
is pasted in the speaker notes.

6
00:00:13,023 --> 00:00:14,643
Then, add strings.xml, and

7
00:00:14,643 --> 00:00:17,710
use the strings that I provided
also in the speaker notes.

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:22,330
And then finally, update
Build.gradle And AndroidManifest.xml.

9
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,230
Make sure you do all of
these before continuing.
