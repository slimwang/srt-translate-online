1
00:00:00,362 --> 00:00:02,455
And that's it, job done.

2
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:04,867
We've taken an entirely
online only site and

3
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:07,154
made it an offline
first progressive app.

4
00:00:07,154 --> 00:00:09,365
By making it to the end of this course,

5
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:12,422
you're ready to take on
any offline first project.

6
00:00:12,422 --> 00:00:16,117
Wittr was specifically designed to cover
most of the gnarly edge cases you'll

7
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:17,240
encounter in the wild.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,970
For example, cache versioning for
big updates like theme changes,

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,406
interactive updates to get the user onto
the latest version, dealing with server

10
00:00:25,406 --> 00:00:29,714
rendering by serving a page skeleton,
responsive images, multiple caches,

11
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:33,603
you even had to master indexedDB,
the most feared API in the platform.

12
00:00:33,603 --> 00:00:34,904
You did it all.

13
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:37,986
But to spell out exactly what we
achieved, for the very last time,

14
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:39,263
we dial into America land.

15
00:00:39,263 --> 00:00:40,927
Mike, are you there?

16
00:00:40,927 --> 00:00:41,817
>> I am.

17
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:44,534
>> Show us where we started and
where we are now?

18
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:45,835
>> With pleasure.

19
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:48,605
If the user's on some kind
of non-perfect connection,

20
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:51,965
they used have to wait for the page
to appear, and imagery took ages.

21
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:54,747
Now, stuff appears on
the screen instantly.

22
00:00:54,747 --> 00:00:58,772
Lie-fi users used to be left staring
at a white screen forever, but

23
00:00:58,772 --> 00:01:00,760
now they get content instantly.

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,533
Offline users used to get
a browser error page.

25
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:06,974
Now they get content and
a non-disruptive custom error.

26
00:01:06,974 --> 00:01:10,174
This is a huge improvement
in the user experience.

27
00:01:10,174 --> 00:01:11,948
>> If your site works offline first,

28
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:15,933
users are going to notice that it loads
reliably and fast whatever the network.

29
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:19,439
They'll have a less frustrating
experience with your site than the rest

30
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,432
of the web, and that's what matters,
the user experience.

31
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,751
And with that, it's goodbye from me.

32
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,769
>> And goodbye from me.

33
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:30,445
>> We look forward to a web that
works whatever the connection is.
