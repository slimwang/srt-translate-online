1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,590
Having obtained a strong
foundation in classical AI,

2
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:06,389
in term two you'll enter
the cutting edge of AI.

3
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:09,349
In particular you'll get a chance
to build amazing agents using deep

4
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:11,830
learning, with leaders
from the industry.

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,519
For instance, you can work with the team
behind Amazon Alexa to build a recurrent

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,059
neural network based
speech-to-text system

7
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,809
that converts your human
speech into real text.

8
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:23,669
Or, you can work with
the team behind IBM Watson to

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,310
build a deep learning based system,

10
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:28,929
to extract meaning from example
sentences that we will provide you.

11
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:33,200
Or finally, you can work with
the MIT PHD team behind Affectiva

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,540
to build convolutional neural network-based computerization systems,

13
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:39,129
that automatically classify and
detect objects.
