1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,344
And when we graph this, it looks about like

2
00:00:02,344 --> 00:00:05,965
this. It’s a big function that has the highest

3
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:09,736
value at the center, nineteen and then falls

4
00:00:09,736 --> 00:00:13,492
down in some interesting way that looks awfully

5
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:16,097
much like the way the previous exercise fell down.

6
00:00:16,097 --> 00:00:17,757
So even for this different experiment with

7
00:00:17,757 --> 00:00:20,342
the die, we get about the same phenomenon that

8
00:00:20,342 --> 00:00:23,969
the sum of those seems to have a distinct high

9
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:27,587
probability for what’s the most likely outcome

10
00:00:27,587 --> 00:00:30,868
four and then it falls off in some interesting way.

11
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:33,386
So this is effectively what’s called the central

12
00:00:33,386 --> 00:00:35,473
limit theorem. And this sounds complicated and

13
00:00:35,473 --> 00:00:38,501
in fact it is, but here is the simple version

14
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:41,269
to remember. Suppose you’re doing many

15
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:43,578
experiments. Each of these experiments over

16
00:00:43,578 --> 00:00:45,146
here have some distribution, we don’t care,

17
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:48,119
it has to just be reasonable and you sum those

18
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,830
all up for some very large number and if N is

19
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,195
large then the joint distribution of the sum of

20
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:59,869
those with approach a function it looks like this.

21
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:02,057
That’s called a Gaussian. We discuss the

22
00:01:02,057 --> 00:01:04,587
Gaussian in depth. It has its own formula and

23
00:01:04,587 --> 00:01:07,886
typically if N is as big as thirty that is maybe

24
00:01:07,886 --> 00:01:10,051
your test thirty people whether they have

25
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:12,827
cancer or not, that’s usually good enough to

26
00:01:12,827 --> 00:01:15,853
approximate this really complicated binomial

27
00:01:15,853 --> 00:01:17,873
over here with this relatively simple Gaussian

28
00:01:17,873 --> 00:01:20,346
function. We’ll learn more about this later,

29
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:23,235
but the key thing to remember is we take many

30
00:01:23,235 --> 00:01:28,380
experiments, you add them up and outcomes a

31
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,600
function just like this. That’s called the

32
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,000
central limit theorem.
