1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,140
So I'm going to start with
something we actually discussed

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,840
at the very beginning of our class,
which is the idea of threat modeling and

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,230
developing a security mindset.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,470
Which requires us to think like
the people who are going to attack us or

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,640
their adversary.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,543
Now I know you've done some real
interesting work in this area.

7
00:00:19,543 --> 00:00:20,200
>> Yes.
>> So

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,420
how does one think like the adversary?

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,200
Well first off I'd say it's almost
a guarantee to make you less popular

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,120
if you think like that, but you have to.

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,300
A lot involves getting into the head
of someone you think that would

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,410
have some purpose that's
counter to yours.

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:44,010
So if you're designing a system
you have to say well who would be

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,000
incentivized for a variety of
reasons to subvert that system?

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,550
And then try and anticipate who they are
and how resourced they are, what type of

16
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,000
capabilities they have, and then what
they could then, in turn, do to you.
