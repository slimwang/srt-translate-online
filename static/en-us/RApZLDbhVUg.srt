Since you did so well with the last rational inequality I gave you, here's

2
00:00:04,221 --> 00:00:08,546
another one. We have 18 minus x over 3x minus 6 is less than 5. This is great,

3
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:12,771
except for one big issue. In order to find our critical points, we're going to

4
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:17,232
need zero on one side of our inequality. So, first things first. Can you tell me

5
00:00:17,232 --> 00:00:21,596
what we need to do to get 0 on the right hand side over here? What do we need to

6
00:00:21,596 --> 00:00:25,355
do to both sides of the inequality to make this happen? In this box, I'd like

7
00:00:25,355 --> 00:00:29,080
you to fill in the proper operator and number that we need to do to both sides.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,868
So for example, you could add a number, you could subtract a number, you can

9
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:35,469
multiply a number, or you could divide by a number.
