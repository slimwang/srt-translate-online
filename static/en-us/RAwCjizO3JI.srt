1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,980
Business has been really good, so
the bricks a bunch stores expanding.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,141
The existing Lots O Brick store
currently only sells blue and

3
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:10,900
green bricks.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,800
Management wants the Bricks A Bunch
store to still sell only red bricks.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,460
While the Lots O Bricks store
should sell its blue and

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,700
green bricks, and red bricks.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,120
These two stores need to share
the same number of red bricks.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,230
For this quiz, you need to create
a brick warehouse service.

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,870
Both stores should have
access to this service.

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,280
Brick information should be extracted
from each store, combined, and

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,010
put into the service.

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,560
Here's the specific information
that you need to follow.

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,600
The link to the starter code for
this project is in the instructor notes.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,195
When you finished, the feedback
extension will give you a code.

15
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:43,850
Enter that code on the next page.

16
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,300
Ember uses the queue unit
testing framework, and

17
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,210
I created a number of tests
that you need to satisfy.

18
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,000
These tests help guide you through
completing the assignment.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,470
Once all the tests have passed, the
feedback extension will give you a code.

20
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,230
Enter that code on the next page.

21
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,220
You can find the link to this project's
test page in the project's read me file.
