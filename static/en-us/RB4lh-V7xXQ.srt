00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,630
Now let's discuss boot sector
virus in more details.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,310
First let's look at
how boot sector works.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,370
A boot sector is a special sector
on the hard drive of a system.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,865
When a system is booted the code in
a boot sector will always run first.

5
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:17,565
In a code, it's called bootstrap loader.

6
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:20,355
The bootstrap loader is
typically responsible for

7
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:22,175
loading the operating system.

8
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:22,865
For example,

9
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:27,885
it may ask a user to choose a list
of operating systems to boot from.

10
00:00:27,885 --> 00:00:32,615
For example, the bootstrap loader
typically may ask a user to choose

11
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:36,490
an operating system from a list and
then loads that operating system.

12
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,820
And this is how system
boots from a hard drive.

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,530
Again, it starts with
code in the boot sector.

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,768
And then when a bootstrap loader runs,
it loads the operating system.

15
00:00:45,768 --> 00:00:49,120
When a boot-strapper
virus infects the system,

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,380
the virus code is inserted
in the boot sector.

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,920
And the reason is, boot sector again,
is a special place in the hard drive and

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,890
the code there will always be
executed first when the system boots.

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,440
So, by putting virus code there,

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,790
whenever system boots the boot
sector virus will run.

21
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,520
Then, of course, the boot sector virus
can perform a number of malicious

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,200
functions such as infecting
other programs on the system,

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,740
spreading to other systems and stealing
useful documents from the system.

24
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,010
After the virus code runs, the boot
sector virus should transfer the control

25
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,740
to the original bootstrap loader so
that the system can boot normally,

26
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,930
at least appear to the user
that the system boots normally.
