00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:06,660
That would be the function y equals 1 half to the x plus 3. We've seen before

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,752
that in order to shift a function up by three units, we need to replace y with

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:20,397
y minus 3. Doing that and then adding 3 to both sides, gives us this answer.
