00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And let's really ask about probabilities.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's say for now, we have a fair coin with a probability of heads is 0.5.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If I flip a coin five times, what's the probability the number of heads is exactly 1.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You should be able to compute this.
