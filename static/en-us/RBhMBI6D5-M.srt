00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,420
So, I search for how to record audio in swift.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,990
And in here, I found this Stack Overflow.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,510
By the way, the link to this Stack Overflow with some helpful code

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,480
is available in the instructor notes.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,540
Now, one thing software engineers will do on a regular basis is that they will

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,620
read code that other people have written, and they will try and

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,320
figure out how that code works.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,380
And here is our opportunity to practice that.

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,100
This is the code I got from Stack Overflow with a few changes that I made.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,890
Now, we know that this code can help us record audio.

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,080
See if you can figure out how the different lines of the code can help us

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,380
accomplish that goal.

13
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,580
In other words, try and

14
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,010
translate this code into simple English, and enter your thoughts in this box.

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,600
By the way, this code is also available in the instructor notes for

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,470
you to experiment with.
