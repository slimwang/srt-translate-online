1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now let's do a little bonus question here.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And this is, again, a rather challenging one, but I think you can figure it out.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So exponential time, as you know, is time of O(2)

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to the power of some polynomial of n, so we'll just write this as p(n).

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And, of course, p is some polynomial of n,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and this here is also a polynomial of n,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and this is O(2^p(n)).

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,500
My question for you is, given that we can simulate nondeterministic polynomial time

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,000
and deterministic exponential time, does that imply that these two classes here--

10
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
EXPTIME and NEXPTIME--are actually the same?
