Thinking about what we talked about in the last quiz, what values can x have for

00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:07,882
Grant's story, then? Write this as an inequality. Remember, that this

00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:11,851
restriction, that we're going to place here, does not in any way, change the

4
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:16,072
fact that, mathematically speaking, this is the correct answer, as a solution,

00:00:16,072 --> 00:00:20,012
for this inequality. We're just trying to take real life into account now.
