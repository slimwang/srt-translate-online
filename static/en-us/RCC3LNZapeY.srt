00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,250
There are certain analytics that game
developers should always be thinking

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,950
about, and it always starts at
the high level of lifetime value.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,530
Once you have a good idea of
how you want to measure or

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,550
calculate your lifetime value, then
you can determine what other analytics

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,480
in particular that you
want to be looking at.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,325
For instance, usually everybody
starts with retention, so

7
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:21,621
that's the number of people
who are coming back or

8
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:24,540
the percentage of people who
are coming back on specific days.

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,780
Day 1, day 14, day 28.

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,476
On the monetization side,

11
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:34,670
it really depends on the type of
monetization method that you're using.

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,080
So, if you're using
primarily in-app purchases,

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,410
then you want to look at
the average revenue per purchase.

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,630
The average purchase size.

15
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,374
If you're looking at things
such as monetizing through ads,

16
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:50,903
then you want to look at ad
specific monetization metrics.

17
00:00:50,903 --> 00:00:53,712
So things like the effective
cost per thousand.

18
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:56,720
The ECPM, the fill rate.

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,040
As well as, frequencies that you're
showing ads, things like that.

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,810
All of this is generally distilled into
the ARPU, the average revenue per user.

21
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,730
Or the RPPU which is the average
revenue per paying user.

22
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,700
And along the way you can make up
whatever acronyms make the most sense

23
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,260
for your game.
