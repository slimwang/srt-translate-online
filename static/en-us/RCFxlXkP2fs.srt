00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,692
If you recall from earlier in this unit, the way that we compacted an array of

2
00:00:03,692 --> 00:00:10,914
input elements was to compute the address for each of the input elements to be written into the output array,

3
00:00:10,914 --> 00:00:18,127
and then we would scatter these input elements using these scatter addresses into the output array.

4
00:00:18,127 --> 00:00:26,605
We've computed, for instance, that element 21 would be scattered by address 5 into output location 5.

5
00:00:26,605 --> 00:00:29,874
We're going to have the same goal here with merge, but we're going to use a different algorithm,

6
00:00:29,874 --> 00:00:34,804
and our algorithm is going to rely on both of the input arrays being sorted.

7
00:00:34,804 --> 00:00:37,374
So let's take a little bit of a closer look.

8
00:00:37,374 --> 00:00:43,313
So, mentally, we're going to think about assigning 1 thread per input element in each of the 2 sorted lists.

9
00:00:43,313 --> 00:00:49,119
So in this example, we're going to merge 2 sorted sequences of 4 elements each,

10
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:54,156
so we would launch 8 threads, each of which would be responsible for 1 input element.

11
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:57,795
So the goal of each thread is, just like the compact example,

12
00:00:57,795 --> 00:01:03,505
to calculate the position of its element in the final list and then scatter that element there.

13
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:06,284
So, to start with, let's figure out what we are trying to do.

14
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:11,473
What we're going to ask you to do is fill in the scatter addresses for these 2 sorts.

15
00:01:11,473 --> 00:01:16,620
This is a very useful and common thing that you need to be able to do as you're building a parallel algorithm,

16
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,454
understanding the scatter pattern that will let you get to the final answer.

17
00:01:20,454 --> 00:01:24,154
Since you're going to generate a dense sorted list of 8 elements,

18
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:28,154
the scatter addresses in these 8 boxes are going to be the numbers from 0 to 7.
