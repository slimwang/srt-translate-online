1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,503
But suppose you don't know the radius.

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:03,070
Okay?

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,040
Megan sent the postcard to the wrong place.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,519
You moved, because you wanted to upscale your apartment and

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,645
now you know you shouldn't have, because you're left without a radius.

6
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:12,680
So what do we do?

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,949
Well, let's think about it this way.

8
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:15,916
All right?

9
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:20,011
Now our Hough space has three dimensions, a, b and r,

10
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:22,690
because we don't know what the radius.

11
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,758
All right?

12
00:00:23,758 --> 00:00:27,161
So now if I have single point, what happens?

13
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:31,666
Well, now if we knew the radius, let's say, the radius was, I don't know, seven

14
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,736
over here, then it would be some sort of a circle centered about this point.

15
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,905
Right? Just like that we did before.

16
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:40,965
And if the radius was let's say, three,

17
00:00:40,965 --> 00:00:46,313
it would be another circle centered about the same point, but smaller.

18
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:51,131
So I hope you can start to see that what we're getting in here is

19
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:53,087
actually a cone, okay?

20
00:00:53,087 --> 00:01:00,127
So with unknown radius, each point votes for an entire cone in this 3D space.

21
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:01,362
So the surface of the cone, right?

22
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:04,364
Not a filled in cone, but the cone that's a surface.

23
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,300
And the next point, what does it do?

24
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,903
It votes for another cone and you can sum these all up.

25
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,806
Now I will tell you this is pretty painful.

26
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:15,222
And in fact, if any of you end up doing a problem set for some random course

27
00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:18,646
like this one, we're going to to tell you in terms of looking for circles.

28
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:23,050
If you try to vote in a great big 3D space, it's not going to work so well.

29
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,661
And in a whole bunch of lectures later when we teach you about ransack,

30
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:29,123
it'll sort of overcome this dimensionality.

31
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:33,171
But for now, just know that we have this little problem of growing the size of

32
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:34,195
the voting space.

33
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:37,632
So it can be done, it's, it's just a little bit painful.

34
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:42,005
But remember before, one of the ways we got rid of the number of

35
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:45,973
votes you had to do was by using the gradient direction?

36
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:47,174
Okay?

37
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,915
So because if like, I had a point and

38
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:52,179
I knew the gradient, there was only one possible line it could be.

39
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,615
Well, we can do the same thing with circles.

40
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:58,052
All right? So now we have an unknown radius, but we have a gradient.

41
00:01:58,052 --> 00:01:58,986
All right?

42
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:02,324
So again, our Hough space is a, b and r.

43
00:02:02,324 --> 00:02:07,294
But this time, our one point here, it has this gradient.

44
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,262
Okay?

45
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,851
Well, now if we knew the radius,

46
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:14,835
we would just have one possible circle it could be.

47
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:15,369
Right?

48
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:18,831
So if you tell me that this is a point and that this is the gradient that I

49
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:21,842
know the radius, that's the only place the center can be.

50
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:25,479
But if the radius was half that, then the center would be there.

51
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,182
Or the center, I guess it also could be on the other side.

52
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:31,901
So it's just this single line of voting that can happen when you

53
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,722
have the gradient and that's drawn like that.

54
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:38,397
So in the Hough space, even though it's a three dimensional Hough space,

55
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:40,161
you would only vote along one line.

56
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:40,728
Okay?

57
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:43,964
And so that's a little bit better, at least it makes the voting easier.

58
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:47,030
You still have this problem when you have this three dimensional Hough space.
