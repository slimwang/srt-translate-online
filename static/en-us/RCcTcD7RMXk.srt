00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,774
I want you to change the particle demo a little. Instead of 8,000 particles

2
00:00:03,774 --> 00:00:08,125
placed at random, I want you to create 9,261 particles in a highly structured

3
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:13,094
grid. Rewrite the point generation part of the code to place a particle at

4
00:00:13,094 --> 00:00:16,870
every point in a 2,000 by 2,000 by 2,000 unit grid centered around the origin,

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:22,344
spaced 100 units apart. In other words, you'll want to a point at x, y, z

6
00:00:22,344 --> 00:00:26,439
equals negative 1,000, negative 1,000, negative 1,000, x, y, z negative 900,

7
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,408
1,000, 1,000 and so on throughout the grid in all directions up to point x, y,

8
00:00:30,408 --> 00:00:37,410
z 1,000, 1,000, 1,000. There are 21 points you'll place along any given axis.

9
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:44,140
This should add up to 9,261 points, which is 21 times 21 times 21. When you're

10
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,850
done you should see this on the screen. I've turned the background color to

11
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,680
gray so that it's easier to see the particles themselves.
