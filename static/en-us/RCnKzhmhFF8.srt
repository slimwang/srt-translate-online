00:00:03,195 --> 00:00:05,320
preferences really affect this feature list

00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,355

00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:09,760
>> Yeah, this is a really common problem, and this is

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,320
a very bad thing. But, this even happens to experienced Android designers

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,320
and developers. So, what happens is when you try and design

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,460
a feature list with no user in mind, really bad things happen.
