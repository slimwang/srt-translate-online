1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,430
Okay, so the way you can think about this question is by looking at the first

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,820
message and why it makes sense to have two bits per symbol. So you can be

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,200
present this bit pattern in a tree. So when a new bit comes in, it can be

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,720
either 0 or a 1. If it's a 0, the next

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,212
symbol can be another 0 or it can be 1. The same case here, so if there are

6
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:30,802
two 0s, it is an A, if it is a 0 followed by 1, it is a B, if it is a 1 followed

7
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:36,090
by 0, it is a C, if it is a 1 followed by 1, it is a D. So that

8
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,130
is why you need to ask two questions to reach either

9
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,470
of these symbols. What happens in this new language? So in

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,280
the this new language, it occurs 50% of the time. So

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,390
we can directly ask if it is A or not A.

12
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,450
So that's represent that has 0 or 1, and let A be

13
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:00,490
0. So now we got our A as just a 0. Now if we go on the one

14
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:05,710
branch we can again ask, if it was a 0 or a 1. Now observe that

15
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:11,170
D occurs twice as frequently as B or C. So,

16
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,864
in this case we can be present D here using 1, 0 and

17
00:01:15,864 --> 00:01:18,780
then B or C can occur on this branch

18
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,220
but both cannot occur at the same place, so we

19
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,028
need to differentiate between them using another symbol. So

20
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:28,050
let's do that using 0 and 1 again. So this

21
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:34,872
can be B and this can be C. So B is basically 1, 1, 0 and C will be

22
00:01:34,872 --> 00:01:38,760
1, 1, 1. Now have we actually saved any

23
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,120
bits per symbol, have we saved the number of questions

24
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,370
we asked? Yes because A occurs more frequently and I needed to ask only one

25
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:50,100
question. But what is the exact number of questions we are to ask for symbols?
