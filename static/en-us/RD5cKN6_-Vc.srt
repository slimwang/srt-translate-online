00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,610
Here are a few diagrams representing
the difference between hardware pixels

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,430
and dips.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,530
The blue grid represents
a grid of hardware pixels.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,110
So, one pixel, two, three,
four, five, six, et cetera.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,320
And then, the single orange
square represents a single dip.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,352
So in this diagram,
a dip takes up this much space,

7
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:23,640
of the hardware pixels,
in this case it takes this much.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,715
In this case it takes up this
much of the hardware pixels,

9
00:00:29,715 --> 00:00:32,659
in here it only takes
up one hardware pixel.

10
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:39,230
So which of these diagrams represents
a device pixel ratio of two.

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,260
Remember, the device pixel
ratio compares the number of

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,730
pixels in just one dimension, not two.

13
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,920
So think one dimension.
