00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,140
This one is really tough, so don't worry if you struggled. The expression we

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,288
want is the quantity b divided by 2 squared. For this first example, our b was

3
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:15,700
equal to 6. So if we do 6 divided by 2 and square it, we would get 9. In the

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,214
second case, b was equal to 12. So, 12 divided by 2 squared would be 6 squared,

5
00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:25,640
which is 36, the amount that we should add. In the third case, we had b was

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,996
negative 4. So negative 4 divided by 2 equals negative 2, and then, we square

7
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:36,148
it to get positive 4. Notice that in each case, we always added a certain

8
00:00:36,148 --> 00:00:40,686
amount. This is because even if b is negative, we end up squaring this value,

9
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:45,746
so that way it turns out positive. To complete the square, we'll always add a

10
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:50,526
positive amount, no matter if the b term is negative. And this also works for

11
00:00:50,526 --> 00:00:54,995
our last example. The b was negative 10, so we'll write that here, then we

12
00:00:54,995 --> 00:01:00,560
divided by 2, which gives us negative 5, and we square it to get negative 25.

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,910
This is the powerful expression that we need in order to complete the square.

14
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,173
If you found the expression, and that's pretty amazing. Again, this is a really

15
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:12,335
hard pattern to find and generate on your own. Let's see how we can use this to

16
00:01:12,335 --> 00:01:15,670
solve some quadratic equations by completing the square.
