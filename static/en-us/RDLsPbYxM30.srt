1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,600
It's a, b, or c.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,960
If you remember from calculus, right, when you have a function,

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,710
when it gets to the maximum it's neither going up nor down right there, right?

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,170
So the gradient, the slope is zero.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,790
So I have a function, so I have an image that's got a nice bright spot and

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,310
I'm at the spot that's the brightest.

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,600
Right? The gradient is going to to be zero.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,360
Likewise, if I'm in a hole, and

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,430
I'm at the part that's darkest, the gradient is going to be zero.

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,660
And of course if the entire image is 118, okay?

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,670
Constant, there's no change anywhere, or

12
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,670
just over a neighborhood, also the gradient would be zero.

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,980
So the gradient is zero in any of these three cases.
