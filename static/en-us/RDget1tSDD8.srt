1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,150
currently our process for
entering data in a system we utilize

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,630
software system called Shelter Buddy and
as animals

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,630
are brought into the shelter they are
manually input into our shelter system.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,630
As they go through the different
processes within our organization,

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,810
their medical assessments,

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,640
behavior assessments, those are all
entered into our system as well and

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,090
then at that point they're
made available for adoption.

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,710
Whenever we have adopters,
the adopters information is

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,570
also put into that system and then
linked up with the animal profile for

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,360
whichever animal they've determined
was the best fit for them.

11
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,890
So this is Jacob.

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,570
He is a twelve-week-old
maltipoo mix puppy.

13
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,820
He's really energetic, really really
playful, loves other dogs and

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,110
loves everybody that he meets.

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,170
If you could see his tail
right now it would be wagging.

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,985
So Jacob is a really great example
of how we do our rescue runs

17
00:00:56,985 --> 00:01:01,405
which means we go out to other shelters
and rescue animals from those city and

18
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:04,394
county shelters and
bring them to our organization.

19
00:01:04,394 --> 00:01:09,335
He was originally found as a stray in
the city of San Jose off of Story Road.

20
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:13,370
His owners never came and
claimed him if he had owners.

21
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,280
And so
then he was brought into our system.

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,270
It would have been really fantastic if
at the time he was brought in we could

23
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,900
have utilized a mobile app to input
all of his information at the previous

24
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,490
shelter rather than waiting until we got
him back here because then we could have

25
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,740
already started the process of moving
him through the different channels.
