1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,370
What we've been doing here are the first steps of

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,220
what is called low fidelity prototyping. This is where we

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,730
take paper to make simple representations of our designs. We

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,020
create paper prototypes for communication, and to demonstrate our ideas.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,490
And to find out what works for a user. We

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,340
don't want to invest too much into it, sketching is

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,330
cheap and engineering is expensive. You said the word wire-frames.

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,970
Can you I've heard that word a lot. Can you explain

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:26,475
what that is?

10
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:29,287
>> Well, actually Clifton has a great example of a wire-frame.

11
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:34,640
A wire-frame shows the basic information and placement of different elements.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,950
So he's got a little token here that kind of represents an

13
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,430
image. You know, and I think that's become so familiar to

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,510
us that we know that that's like a picture of somebody,

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,670
even though it doesn't look like anybody I know. In fact,

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,780
it looks kind of like a question mark with a little hump.

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,970
And then this is text, placement for text. And he's out

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,600
it within this frame, which is actually very similar to this frame.

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,273
>> Mm-hm.

20
00:00:54,273 --> 00:00:58,170
>> Right? Of our device. So and then he's got some

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,960
call outs and labels. So this, essentially, is wire frames, all

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,595
these are wire frames. And the difference, say, between his wire

23
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:06,930
frames and yours is that he's constrained them by a frame.

24
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,240
>> Oh.

25
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,840
>> [COUGH] He's sort of put that around and he's thought a little bit about

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,690
how things are positioned within this constraint. So,

27
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,770
he's already one step ahead, which is fine.

28
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,370
>> Wire frames show placement in an actual frame

29
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,480
of a device. And flows are sequences of wire

30
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,480
frames. Flows work to create a user interface story,

31
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,070
in much the same way as a comic strip tells

32
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,490
a story. Now, let's actually make some wire frames

33
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,780
and flows, using those conceptual models that we made earlier.

34
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,770
In fact, let's bring all the elements you generated

35
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,190
before, including the conceptual models, the discoverable signifiers, and the

36
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,650
feedback, into our wire frames and story board.
