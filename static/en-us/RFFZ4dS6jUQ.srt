That worked so well! We should do it again!

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I actually find simulating state machines suprisingly satisfying.

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This time, I'd like you to define edges and accepting to encode

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
the following regular expression,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
definitely [a - b], followed by optionally [c - d].

6
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Name your start state 1.
