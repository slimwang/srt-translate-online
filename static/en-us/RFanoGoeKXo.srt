00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,969
I'm seeing a lot of
green in the timeline,

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,460
which is a pretty good indication
that there's a Paint problem.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,430
I'll go ahead and
zoom into one of these frames.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,010
It looks like each frame is
starting with the script.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,640
There's an Animation Frame Fired
followed immediately by style

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,600
calculations and then a Paint.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,500
This looks like a JavaScript problem
because if the problem was coming from

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,460
CSS, then chances are I wouldn't be
seeing an animation frame being fired.

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,410
So in the end it's pretty clear
that there is a paint problem and

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,790
it's being caused by JavaScript.
