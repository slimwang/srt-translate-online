00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,886
You've just seen a universal algorithm for computing the average of an array of

2
00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:09,460
objects of any type that is willing to implement the measurable interface.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,362
Let's implement another algorithm along the same lines. This time, we want to

4
00:00:13,362 --> 00:00:19,112
compute the largest element in an array. Again, we have an array of objects,

5
00:00:19,112 --> 00:00:24,092
and you may recall from lesson seven how to do this. You figure out what is the

6
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:29,040
largest element that you've seen so far, at the beginning that's the first one.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,752
Then you go through the remainder of the array, if you find a larger one update

8
00:00:32,752 --> 00:00:38,810
largest so far. And at the end that's what you return. So go ahead and complete

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,843
this method, it'll be the last time ever that you have to write it.
