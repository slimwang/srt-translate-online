1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,140
Well then why not just
keep the step size large?

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,490
>> A couple of reasons.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,640
First, with a really large step size,
we can miss sharp hills completely.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,269
Going back to our first starting place.

5
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:15,969
If my step size is this big, I would
skip the hill I intended to take.

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,810
And would start going up
the next hill instead.

7
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:21,919
>> Well, that seems obvious, but
you said there were a couple of reasons.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,650
What's the other one?

9
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:26,519
>> In certain situations, the algorithm
could get into a infinite loop and

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,850
never terminate.

11
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,740
For example,
look at the hill with a global maximum.

12
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,280
If I start to the left of it,
above the shoulder.

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,980
And have a step size this big,
I'll skip to the other side of the hill.

14
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:39,559
Now the gradient is going
to go back the other way.

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,039
So, I step back in
the direction in which I came.

16
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,880
End up close to where I started.

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,190
The algorithm can oscillate and
not converge on the answer.

18
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:49,829
>> But it should be easy to check for
that in our code.

19
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,939
Maybe if we see oscillation,
we could just do smaller steps.

20
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:54,710
>> You've hit upon a key idea.

21
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,969
We can start with a large step size and
decrease it over time.

22
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:00,609
To better ensure,
that we reach the global maximum.

23
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:04,189
However, we'll get the same result with
something called simulated kneeling.

24
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,659
Which is one of the big
concepts of this course.

25
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:07,469
>> Before we continue,

26
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:09,939
I'd like to experiment a bit
with these hill climbing ideas
