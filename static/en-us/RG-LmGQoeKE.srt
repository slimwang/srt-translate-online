00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,199
A cool thing in perspective projection and something that, that you already know

2
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:10,111
is that parallel lines in the world almost always meet at a point in the image.

3
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:15,708
So here's an example of that's two parallel lines out on the ground plane and

4
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,252
they project to two lines in the image.

5
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,645
And you can see that they meet at this point,

6
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:23,758
sometimes called the "Vanishing" point in the image.

7
00:00:23,758 --> 00:00:28,649
And the, the canonical example of that is always railroad tracks, where the,

8
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:31,799
the tracks themselves all converge to some point.

9
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:34,535
So we can sort of intuitively think about that.

10
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:39,140
But what's really cool is you can see that directly from the mathematics of it.

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,477
So let's think about what a line in 3-space is.

12
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:48,315
So a line in 3-space can par, parametrized by a single value a single parameter.

13
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,252
So in this case, we're going to use t.

14
00:00:50,252 --> 00:00:52,131
So we have x of t, y of t and z of t and

15
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:55,698
the idea is as t changes from maybe minus infinity to infinity or

16
00:00:55,698 --> 00:00:59,360
zero to however you want to do it, you would move along that line.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,131
And a line in 3-space starts at some point in 3-space.

18
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:05,933
I'm saying here, x0, y0, z0.

19
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,002
And then its moved along some vector.

20
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:10,471
So right now, we're using the vector a, b, c.

21
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:13,522
So a, a in the x direction, b in the y direction and

22
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:16,377
c in the z direction, scaled by the value of t.

23
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:21,420
So now, let's take a look at where all the points on the line lie in

24
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,716
the image plan.

25
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:25,441
All right? So that's for every x, y, z,

26
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:29,090
what's the x prime and y prime for the given t?

27
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,326
Well, we learned that the equation of the projection from x,

28
00:01:34,326 --> 00:01:39,200
y, z to x prime is just fx over z and for y, it's just fy over z.

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,658
So here, we just substitute it in the expressions from the other side

30
00:01:44,658 --> 00:01:46,073
in terms of t.

31
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:50,863
So that's where all the points on the line go, but

32
00:01:50,863 --> 00:01:54,181
what happens as t gets really big?

33
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:57,593
In the limit as t goes to infinity and I'm going to assume for

34
00:01:57,593 --> 00:02:01,088
now that c is not zero, we'll talk about that in a minute.

35
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,123
Okay?

36
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:05,092
The limit of x prime is just fa over c.

37
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:08,195
The limit of y prime is just fb over c.

38
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:10,198
What's missing?

39
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:13,701
What's missing is x0, y0, z0?

40
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:14,701
In other words,

41
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:18,706
it doesn't matter which point in the world this line starts from.

42
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:19,240
I can start from here.

43
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,040
I can start from here.

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,642
I can start from here.

45
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:26,468
As long as the points are all moving in the direction to a, b,

46
00:02:26,468 --> 00:02:31,218
c, they're all going to converge at this point in the image.

47
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,461
And that's what were,

48
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:35,941
that's why it's the case that all parallel lines in the world, so

49
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:40,061
it's lines that are parallel in the world will all converge to a single point.

50
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:44,720
So the railroad tracks and a sense along the railroad track, since they're all

51
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,836
parallel in the same direction, they all converge to the same point.

52
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:52,072
So what does it mean that c is zero?

53
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:56,977
So c is zero means that the z value doesn't change.

54
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,642
So assuming I'm holding my camera like this, so

55
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:03,350
my image plane is a, a vertical plane, so that z is perpendicular.

56
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,523
If the z value doesn't change,

57
00:03:05,523 --> 00:03:09,557
it means the line in the world is parallel to my image plane.

58
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,584
Doesn't get further away or

59
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:16,830
closer, it stays parallel and those lines will all stay parallel lines.

60
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,540
And that's why I said that almost all pairs of parallel lines in

61
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,369
the world converge to a point.

62
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,844
If you have parallel lines that are vertical or

63
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:27,770
aligned with the image plane, they don't converge.
