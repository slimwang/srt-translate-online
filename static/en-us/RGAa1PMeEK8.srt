00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:00,870
In this lesson,

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,720
we talked about threads, how operating systems represent threads,

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,580
how threads differ from processes, and why they're useful in the first place.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,420
We spent some time talking about several mechanisms related to multithreading,

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,420
and in particular, about mutexes and

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,330
condition variables which are needed for synchronization.

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,810
We also spent some time, at the end, talking about certain challenges,

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,799
solutions, and design approaches that are related to threads and multithreading.
