00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,005
Here, the solutions are 5 plus or minus root 6, all divided by 2. Amazing work

2
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:09,611
if you got these answers. Here, we want to use the square root method since we

3
00:00:09,611 --> 00:00:14,008
have a perfect square on one side of our equation. We square root both sides,

4
00:00:14,008 --> 00:00:19,166
indicating the plus or minus on the right. So we'll have 2x minus 5 equals plus

5
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:24,178
or minus root 6. We add 5 to both sides to isolate 2x, and then we divide both

6
00:00:24,178 --> 00:00:30,310
sides by 2 to get 1x is equal to 5 halves plus or minus root 6 divided by 2. We

7
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,665
can leave our answers separated as two fractions or add and subtract them

8
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:36,290
together to leave them like this.
