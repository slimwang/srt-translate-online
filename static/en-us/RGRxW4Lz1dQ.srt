00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,800
In the next three quizzes, I'm going
to be challenging you to take advantage

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,290
of array methods, to programatically
create long chains of promises.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,670
Keep in mind that you want
the thumbnails to appear on the page

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,100
in the same order as they appear
in the search results, but, and

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,460
this is an important but,

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,790
this does not mean that you need
to perform the request in series.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,690
There are different strategies for
controlling the order that

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,990
promises resolve,
which you'll be trying out soon.

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,980
The keystone to all of these
strategies is the idea of a sequence.

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,968
You'll need to create a sequence
of promises that are chained,

11
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:39,310
one after another.
