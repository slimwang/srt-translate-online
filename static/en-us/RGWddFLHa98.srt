00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,120
Trying to learn new things will really help keep the brain healthy. Because the

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,800
more things they do that require new learning, the more neural growth there is.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,635
If you chose this, continuing to practice things I already know, that won't

4
00:00:11,635 --> 00:00:15,820
hurt. It'll make the neural connections stronger. Drinking a lot of alcohol is

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:21,800
not a good choice. Staying physically fit is always a good idea. And

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,050
socializing with others, or playing with pets, neither one would hurt. But I

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,250
would say, the most important, would be to try to learn new things. But now

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,689
let's go talk about the different types of intelligence, and how they're

9
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,500
important in later adult life.
