1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,350
We've reached the end of lesson one, and we've covered a lot of concepts

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,110
that can be summarized into four main

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,800
points. Point one. Every human is a collection

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,930
of traits. Traits that can be described

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,320
as either physical or behavioral, visible or hidden,

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,100
and learned or innate. Point two. Inheritance

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,265
patterns have been described in many different ways.

8
00:00:21,265 --> 00:00:21,800
[INAUDIBLE]

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,600
Two important ways are blended versus particulate

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,010
inheritance. With particulate inheritance laying the foundation for

11
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,990
modern genetics, and our idea of the individual

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,310
unit called a gene. Point three. The Environment

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:41,970
can play a major role in the presentation of certain traits. And point four. The

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,680
hereditary material that's passed down from generation to

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,350
generation is made up of a chemical substance

16
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,740
called DNA which comprises what we call our genome.
