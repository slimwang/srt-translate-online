1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,870
So the other law that we're
going to talk about is

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,980
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or
popularly known as the DMCA.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:14,410
And this has to do with,
we discussed intellectual property.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,420
So content,
digital content software, and

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,940
the problem it helps
to address is piracy.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:27,820
Illegal copying for example or
theft of these kind of digital objects.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,160
That's what DMCA covers.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,840
So first of all,
it says that digital objects,

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,230
the kind I was talking about,
actually can be copyrighted.

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,400
So you have protections
that you get when you're

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,550
able to obtain a copyright on something.

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,940
Well, the same thing now applies to,
that was the non-digital law,

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,000
the same thing now applies
to digital objects.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,100
Well, DMCA says it is a crime for
you to circumvent and disable

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:00,983
any measures that are there that have to
do with copy protection and anti-piracy.

16
00:01:00,983 --> 00:01:05,370
So it is built into the object,
it sort of and

17
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,790
undo that, and that act is
considered illegal if you do that.

18
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:17,310
It also not only can't do that, it
makes it criminal for you to actually,

19
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:23,090
whatever idea that you had to produce
something based on that, manufacture it.

20
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,910
And then sell and distribute it so
somebody else can defeat the copy

21
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,550
protection or the anti-piracy
measures that are in place.

22
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,940
So essentially what we're saying is
that we need to protect those and

23
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,550
it's illegal to undo those
protections and sort of indulge in

24
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:46,815
commerce that allows you to
let other people do the same.
