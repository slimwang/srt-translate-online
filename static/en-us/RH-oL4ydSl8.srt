00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,810
I think the most important realization that I had when I got into computer

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,100
science. Or the best advice that I got, was just somebody telling me, you're

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,100
not bad at it. And by it, I mean programming. It's really hard because

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,350
programming is a completely new way of thinking. It's like learning a language.

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,130
And, it's really easy to struggle and people always seem like they know what

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,610
they're doing. because some people have been programming since they were like

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,530
three in the basement with their little like calculators and stuff. And I

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:29,100
wasn't one of those people. And so, it took me a long time to just sort of

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,480
realize that I could do it just as well as anybody else. And just sticking to

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,660
it is the best thing that you can do. And there's so much help out there

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,570
between, you know, online courses. just sort of forums on the internet or your

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,310
friends, anything. And just being vulnerable and asking for help is the way

13
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,170
that I've gotten through it.
