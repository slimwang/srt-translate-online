1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,830
This realization about
the Vandermonde matrix

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,130
leads us to the inverse
fast Fourier transform.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,250
We're given the values of a polynomial
at the roots of unity, and

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,960
we want to recover the coefficients
of that polynomial.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,620
The algorithm is fantastically simple,
given what we've established so far.

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,670
Just run the regular fast Fourier
transform only passing in the values,

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,860
and the inverse of the root of
unity that we used the first time.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,070
Then divide the result by N.

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,940
Recall that the values that
we receive as input here

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,680
were equal to the Vandermonde
matrix times the coefficient.

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,190
By multiplying the vectors
of these values

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,260
by the Vandermonde matrix parameterized
by omega inverse, we end up with

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,760
n times the identity matrix times those
coefficients, and so we just need to

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,360
divide this result by N in order to get
back the original coefficients exactly.
