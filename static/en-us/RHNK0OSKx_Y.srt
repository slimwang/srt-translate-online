00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,990
Now, let's wrap up this entire unit and our entire course by trying to solve

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:11,065
some equations with logarithms. For this equation, we'll have log base 2 of 64

3
00:00:11,065 --> 00:00:16,355
equals x. What I want you to do is to try and change this log form into

4
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:22,850
exponential form, and then solve for x. You can write the value of x here.
