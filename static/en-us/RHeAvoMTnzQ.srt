1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,936
And we're going to do a strategy that we've done before. Let's look at a simpler

2
00:00:04,948 --> 00:00:09,803
version of the problem. A pair of shoes costs $60 and is on sale for 20% off.

3
00:00:09,912 --> 00:00:14,864
What will you pay for the shoes? The key thing is that we do not pay 100% of the

4
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:19,289
price. If we did pay 100% of the price, our math would look like this. We'd have

5
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:19,341
$60 times 100%.

6
00:00:19,358 --> 00:00:28,005
I know percent means out of 100. So, I have 60 times 100 over 100. Well, I know

7
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:34,350
100 of our 100 is just 1, so I have 60 times 1. I could have just gotten that by

8
00:00:34,362 --> 00:00:40,475
moving my decimal two places to the left. We know dividing by 100 is the same

9
00:00:40,487 --> 00:00:47,149
thing as moving the decimal two places left. So, I would owe $60. Notice, if you

10
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:52,420
have 100% of something, the value doesn't change. My price originally was $60,

11
00:00:53,058 --> 00:00:55,384
and if I pay 100%, I still pay $60.
