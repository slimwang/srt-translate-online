1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,710
Now, we don't expect our predictions to be 100% accurate. There will almost

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:11,040
always be some error in our predictions. And that's in terms of the residuals.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,910
How can we quantify how much error we have? Well, remember mean and standard

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:21,500
deviation when we just had one variable? We had distributions that were fat and

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:27,600
skinny. And our expected value was always the mean. But we could always pick a

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,870
random value that's out here in the tails, and that's due to error. And how did

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,550
we measure this error? We used standard deviation as a measure to tell us how

8
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:45,090
far we expect most scores to fall from the mean. Now, let's take a step back.

9
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,740
We have two data sets. We'll just call them red and blue for now. They have the

10
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,100
same regression line, as shown by this black line. You're trying to estimate

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:00,710
the y value when x equals 12. The expected or predicted value will be the same

12
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,560
for both, since they have the same regression line. But we can bet that the

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,420
actual or observed value won't be exactly equal to this. It might be somewhere

14
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,760
up here or down here, we won't know. We can only guess. But, for which data

15
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,580
set, red or blue, do you expect the actual measurement will be closer to the

16
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,330
prediction.
