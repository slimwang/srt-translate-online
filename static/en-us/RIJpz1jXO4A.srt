00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,830
>> The number right in between these two numbers, smack dab in the middle, is

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,082
50,915. You may have realized this, but this is the average of those two middle

00:00:10,082 --> 00:00:15,469
numbers. We always take the average of the two middle numbers when finding the

4
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:20,779
median of data sets with an even number of scores. So, in this case, there are 6

00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:21,360
scores.
