The first question is about star networks. A star

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,480
network is a network that has a single node

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,820
in the center that is connected to all the

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,300
rest of the nodes in the graph directly. So,

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,540
here's a star network with five nodes. It has

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,860
one, two, three, four edges. Now, what you should

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,240
do, is write a python program that returns the

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,410
number of edges in the star network with n nodes.
