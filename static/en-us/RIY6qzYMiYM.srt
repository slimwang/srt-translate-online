00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,860
Design guidelines are one of several ways of gauging the quality of

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,120
your designs.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,190
Of course, the ultimate validation of a design is to build a program and

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,035
have its users report their satisfaction.

5
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:15,680
Short of that, you can build a prototype or conduct design reviews.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,580
There are also various metrics based on the structural properties of

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,720
your design that compute actual numbers assessing the design's quality.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,870
Least expensive, but conceivably most valuable,

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,480
is adherence to the principles we will go over in this lesson.
