1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,760
To solve this problem, I started where
attach event listeners gets called.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,230
It's generally it occurs inside an event
listener for dom content loaded.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,810
When attach event listeners gets
called there is a flag that's set for

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,990
sliding and that indicates whether or
not the toggle's actually sliding.

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,550
I'm going to take advantage of this
flag to figure out when I should use

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,950
events on the window to move the toggle.

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,290
You'll see,
inside attach event listeners

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,930
I set the touch start event
listener on the toggle itself.

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,010
This is because I wanted to make sure
that sliding starts when somebody is

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,450
actually touching the toggle,
not some random place on the screen.

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,050
Inside the event listener I set sliding
to true because at this point the toggle

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,680
should be able to slide.

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,280
And I added the first movement
to the toggle tracker.

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,670
Remember add movement is expecting
the x position of either a mouse or

15
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,480
a finger on the screen, so in order to
get that I'm using the event object.

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,220
The event object contains a touches
array and there's only one touch.

17
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,430
And it has a property pageX which
is exactly what I'm looking for.

18
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,000
Next up, here comes the move.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,760
So on touchmove, I look for
if the toggle is (sliding) already.

20
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,990
I need to look for (sliding) because I
attached touchmove to the whole window.

21
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,680
And that's because somebody's finger
can pretty easily slip off the toggle.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,820
And so if the toggle should
actually be (sliding),

23
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,590
I add the movement
the same way I did before.

24
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,260
And then i request an animation
frame using the slide callback.

25
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,740
And this is what actually
makes the toggle move.

26
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,450
And lastly, I want to watch out for
any touchend events, whether or

27
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,520
not they occur on the toggle itself.

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,690
So, in that case,
I add toucnend to the window.

29
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,580
It doesn't matter where the finger
gets let up on the screen.

30
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,180
In that case, sliding is done.

31
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,600
I then did basically the same thing for
mousedown, mousemove and mouseup.

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,850
The only difference is now I don't have
a touches object on the event objects

33
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,620
and I can simply go straight to pageX.

34
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,610
Cool, okay, that's enough code.

35
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,480
Let me show you what this looks like.

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,690
Just like before,
touch events seem to be working and

37
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,850
mouse events work as well.

38
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,090
I can slide off and keeps going but
as soon as I let up, no more sliding.
