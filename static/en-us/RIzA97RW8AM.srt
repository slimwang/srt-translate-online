00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
Our third question, student Redmars asks,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,540
"Why did we choose Python?"

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,510
>>So, there are lots of languages we could have chosen--

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,940
The real reason for choosing Python is--

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,710
it is a very simple language, but it is also a language that is widely used,

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,950
and can very quickly get you on the path to building interesting programs.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,450
There are many, many programming languages.

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,500
It is definitely important, and a great thing as you develop as a computer scientist

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,690
that you learn more and more languages.

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,600
But, to start with a language that will be easy to learn, and still powerful--

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,000
Python is a great choice for that.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There are certainly some other choices,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but I happen to think Python is a good one for this class.
