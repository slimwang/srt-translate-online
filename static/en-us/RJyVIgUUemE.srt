For some analysis tasks, it's not easy to get the

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,140
data we need. The data's there somewhere, but not in

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,790
a form that we can simply download. In these situations,

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,120
the data is usually found in bits and pieces that

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,760
you need to wrangle together. Sometimes all the pieces are

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,170
on a single website, and sometimes you need to bring

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,250
them together from multiple sources. As data wranglers, we need

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,470
to be nimble and creative in gathering the data we need.
