1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
To me, the answer is 0 for the first one, 2-2=0.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So the first expression is 0 and the second one is going to be 0 as well.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The next one is 1, 1-2=-1. For the second expression, 2-3=-1. -1*-1 gives us a 1.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The last one would be 9, -1-2 is -3 for the first expression. 0-3 is also -3 so we get a -3*-3=9.
