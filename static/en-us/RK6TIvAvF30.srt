1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
The correct answer is, if we know the optimization version to be tractable,

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,630
then the decision version is also tractable.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,800
If we know it to be intractable, then the decision version is also intractable.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,240
The same goes if we have the information about the decision version.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,520
You see, the tractability of an optimization version

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,680
and of a decision version are closely related.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,690
Now, two of these answers I think are more obvious than two others ones.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:29,850
I think the answer to question #1 is rather obvious because if the optimization version is tractable

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,420
so you can find the best possible solution in polynomial time,

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,430
then with that solution you can also very easily answer a yes or no question about the solution.

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:46,730
The same thing is true I think for answer #4 because if the decision version is intractable

12
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,850
then the optimization version also has to be intractable or if you could easily solve

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,990
the optimization version then it would also be easy to answer a yes or no question about the solution.

14
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,680
The answers to question #2 and #3 I think are a little bit less obvious.

15
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,460
If you know the optimization version to be intractable, then of course it could be the case that

16
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,800
just having to say yes or no given the size of the solution that you're looking for

17
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,380
could be easier, that could be tractable.

18
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:20,390
So you would have to show in some way that if the decision version were tractable,

19
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,290
then the optimization version would also be easy to solve,

20
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,360
which is basically what I've asked you to think about in question #3 here.

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,670
One way to show this is and this is not very precise but just to give you an idea here that

22
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:37,550
if you have a tractable decision version then you could ask multiple questions

23
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,050
about the solution and still remain in polynomial time.

24
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:46,110
So for example if you're looking for the best possible solution for vertex cover,

25
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,400
you could first ask the decision version say for n/2 as the value of k you're looking for

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,710
and see if you can find a solution of this size.

27
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,070
If that is the case, you can decrease k or if you cannot find a solution that is that small

28
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,410
then you have to increase k and by solving the decision version often enough

29
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:09,199
so searching for that optimum k you can also solve the optimization version.

30
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,770
So this is not that obvious to see but for now you can keep in mind that optimization versions

31
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,230
of a problem and decision versions of a problem behave more or less the same

32
00:02:19,230 --> 99:59:59,999
with respect to tractability or intractability.
