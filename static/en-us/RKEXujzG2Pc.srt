1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,955
So here's overall what we just did. We changed the equation y equals x squared

2
00:00:04,955 --> 00:00:10,243
minus 8x plus 15, an equation for a parabola in standard form. To the equation y

3
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:15,184
plus 1 equals x minus 4 squared. So now we should be able to really easily where

4
00:00:15,184 --> 00:00:19,824
the vertex of this parabola is. I'd like you to write the coordinates of this

5
00:00:19,824 --> 00:00:21,213
vertex in these boxes.
