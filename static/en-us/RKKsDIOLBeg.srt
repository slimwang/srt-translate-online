00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,117
As we go ahead and start applying rules of inferences to sentences in

2
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:08,354
a knowledge base. We'll find it convenient to rewrite the sentences in

3
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:13,280
a knowledge base. And sometimes it will be very useful to rewrite these

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,170
sentences in the knowledge base in a manner that eliminates the implications in

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,690
a sentence. And this is how we can eliminate the implication. If a implies b,

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:27,940
than we can rewrite it as not a or b. We know this because the truth

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:33,090
value of a implies b is exactly the same as your truth value of not a or

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,740
b. We can take an example here. Supposing that we are given feathers imply bird.

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,670
Then we can rewrite this as not feathers or bird. And intuitively,

10
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,760
you can see the truth value of this. It is either the animal does not have

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,610
feathers or, it is a bird. In a little bit, we will see that this is

12
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:56,370
a important rewrite rule in doing certain kinds of logical proofs.
