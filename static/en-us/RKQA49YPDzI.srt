So, you want to know how the Chinese puzzle pot

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,660
works? Well, I'm not going to tell you. It's a puzzle.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,650
I want it to remain a puzzle. You figure it out.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,150
You might even ask some friends to try it, and listen

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,110
to their explanations. But go to the forum. That's the place

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,700
where you talk about it. That's where all of you might

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,650
get together. And maybe, the person who does figure it out

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,510
might share the answers with you. They might also share some

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,970
wrong answers. So, try the forum.
