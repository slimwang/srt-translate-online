1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,270
Remember that the diameter is defined
as the longest shortest path.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,170
For a linear network, that path is
the one that connects the endpoints.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,470
So, a good candidate
is to connect those.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,080
In fact, if you do that, then you
get what's called a ring network.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,140
Topologically, a ring is just a circle.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,830
So the longest path is
half the perimeter and

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,520
that's just about half the diameter
of the original network.
