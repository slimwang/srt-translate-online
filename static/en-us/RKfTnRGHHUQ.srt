00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If you're a little bit test-wise, you should be able to guess this even if you don't understand why.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The answer is this, but let me explain why.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What we'd like to show is that if we're given a function f(n) that is in Θ(g(n))

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that we can turn that around and also infer that that means g(n) is in Θ(f(n)).

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The way we're going to show this is to go back to the definition of Big Theta.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Here's the definition--that there is some constant c₁ and c₂ bigger than 0

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and a a threshold n₀ such that f(n) lies between c₁ of g(n) and c₂ of g(n) for all n

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
bigger than the threshold n₀.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We can infer from this that by dividing through this equation dividing through by c₁,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
which is a positive number, we get a new set of inequalities--like so--

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
where g(n) is now sandwiched between 1/c₁ of f(n) and 0.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We can do that same trick again dividing through this equation by c₂.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We see that 1/c₂ of f(n) is less than or equal to g(n).

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We can combine these two facts to show that g(n) is sandwiched between

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
1/c₂ of f(n) and 1/c₁ of f(n)--like so.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Notice that this1/c₂ and 1/c₁--those are just constants.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It equivalent to say that this 1/c₂ is just a constant, and we can rename it c₁,

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and this one 1/c₁ is just a constant and we can rename it c₂,

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and this is exactly the definition of Big Theta,

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
so we can infer from this that g(n) is in Θ(f(n)).
