1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,923
If you completed the previous task,

2
00:00:01,923 --> 00:00:04,778
your copy of the project is in
the right shape to take on this task.

3
00:00:04,778 --> 00:00:09,960
Otherwise, you can run git reset --hard,
to remove any local changes you have.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,100
Then, git checkout page-skeleton
to get up to speed.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,590
As you saw, weâ€™re working in
different script for this exercise.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:25,680
So head over to
public/js/idb-test/index.js.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,560
Here, you can see all the code
that Jake was writing.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,064
And you can see it working in
the browser in local host port

9
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:37,500
8888/idb-test, by working,
I mean you get a blank screen.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,410
But also a couple of
messages in the console.

11
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,590
And you'll see the database
appearing in dev tools.

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,000
You've already seen how to add and

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,120
remove items from the key val object
store, but your task is to set

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,440
the favorite animal key to the name of
your favorite animal, whatever that is.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,920
Once you've changed the code,
refresh the page and

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,040
check dev tools to see if your
favorite animal has appeared in IDB.

17
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,800
To double check everything is working,
head to the settings page.

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,832
And type idb-animal into
the test field and press enter.
