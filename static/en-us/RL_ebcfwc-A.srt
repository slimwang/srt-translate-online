1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,530
And here's the solution.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,920
In the Utility class,

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,830
we add all the helper methods
that were provided in the gist.

4
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,820
We also declare the related
strings in the strings.xml file.

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,252
After we read the high temperature
value from the cursor, we go and

6
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:18,060
try to find the TextView represented
by the ID list_item_high_textview.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,470
Then we use a Utility function
to format the temperature so

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,890
that it can be displayed
in the TextView.

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,900
Then we do the same for
the low temperature value.
