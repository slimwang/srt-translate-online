The answer is no. If you think back to other curves you've looked at, like

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,708
parabolas for example. We saw that we could shift the curves up and down, and

3
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:13,292
we can do the same thing with rational functions, even with the graphs you've

4
00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:19,012
already worked with. In fact, here's what the graph of 4 over x minus 1 would

5
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:23,228
look like If we shifted it up 1, we can see that now the horizontal asymptote

6
00:00:23,228 --> 00:00:28,163
is at y equals 1, instead of at y equals 0.
