00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,800
One air system that does do visual
spatial reasoning is called Galatia.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,450
It was developed by Jim Davies here
at Georgia Tech, about 10 years back.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,730
Which is why it looks black and
white and has this particular form.

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,730
We provide a reference to the paper and
in notes.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,030
There is a very famous problem and

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,220
a logical reasoning
called a Duncke problem.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,260
The Duncke problem goes
something like this.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,880
First I'll tell you a story.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,550
And then I'll give you a problem.

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,060
And you should try to find
an answer to the problem.

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,660
Let me begin with the story.

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,210
Once there was a king and not a
specially good king who ruled a kingdom.

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,575
There was an army.

14
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:39,435
That was trying to overthrow the king.

15
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:43,125
But the king lived in a fortress and
it was very hard to overthrow.

16
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:47,375
Moreover, the king had mined the roads,
so that when the army went over

17
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:51,345
the roads, it would blow off, and most
of the soldiers in the army would die.

18
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:56,280
The leader of the army decomposed
the army into smaller groups, and

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,280
these smaller groups then came to
the fortress from different directions.

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,730
Because each group is small enough,
the mines did not blow off and

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,900
each group was able to reach
the fortress at the same time.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,030
They are able to overthrow the bad king.

23
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,570
This was a story,
now let me tell you about the problem.

24
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,590
There is a patient with
a cancer tumor in his body.

25
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,210
There is a physician with a laser gun.

26
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,840
She can use the laser gun on this tumor
to kill this tumor and cure the patient.

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,810
However, the laser light is so
strong that it will

28
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,570
also kill all the healthy tissue in
the way, and the patient can die.

29
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,320
What should the physician do?

30
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,700
In most computer models of this problem,

31
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,200
this problem is solved using
propositional representations.

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,160
So an example for
proper surplus reduction for

33
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,420
the original story might
be that if there is a goal,

34
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,000
and there is a resource, there is
an obstacle between the resource and

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,160
the goal that split the resource into
many different smaller resources and

36
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,030
bring them to the goal all at the same
time but from different directions.

37
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,210
Most composition models or decomposition
problem extract some causal pattern.

38
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,120
The causal pattern might be
that if there is a goal and

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,800
there is a resourcable level, and

40
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,770
your resource can achieve the goal but
there is an obstacle in the way.

41
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,440
Then decompose the resourcing
to many smaller resources and

42
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,210
bring them to the goal in the same
time from different directions.

43
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,230
The important part here is that
this is the causal pattern

44
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,700
extracted out of the first story.

45
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,563
Once this causal pattern
has been extracted,

46
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,890
it can be applied to this new problem.

47
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,990
So the physician may decompose
the laser being into smaller beams and

48
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,880
focus them on the tumor at the same
time, thus curing the tumour.

49
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,630
Jim wanted to ask whether one could
do the same kind of problem solving

50
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,670
without extracting
these causal patterns.

51
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,910
Could one use simply
visual spatial knowledge?

52
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,070
So this is visual spatial knowledge
because there is both a sense of what,

53
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,320
the fortress, as well as where,
in the middle of the figure.

54
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,460
Notice there is visual spatial knowledge
is represented prepositionally.

55
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,130
There are words here like fortress, and
right road, and top road, and so on.

56
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,990
But there is no causality
that is explicit.

57
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,680
You and I can infer the causality but
it's not explicit.

58
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,590
His Galatea program was able to
find a solution to the new problem

59
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,230
by transporting the visual spatial
knowledge to the new problem,

60
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:19,990
one step at a time.

61
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,880
Thus it would map this top
body part to the top rod.

62
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,700
One here, the left body part,
the left rod here, and

63
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,060
therefore beside that,
this can be decomposed.

64
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,990
This resources, denoted by this arrow,

65
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,900
can be decomposed into
smaller resources.

66
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,620
And then the smaller resources
can arrive at this central tumor

67
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,240
from different directions
at the same time.

68
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:48,070
In this way, Galatea was able
to solve the addition problem

69
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,810
without abstracting any
causal pattern from it.

70
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,130
Of course, one might say that the causal
pattern is implicit here, and

71
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:55,990
that is indeed true.

72
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,740
But the entire point of a visual spatial
knowledge here is that the causal

73
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,910
pattern is not being obstructed, but
as long as it is a problem-solving

74
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,840
procedure where each step is
represented only visually spatially.

75
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,095
It is possible to transfer this

76
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:10,760
problem-solving proceeded
to the new crop.
