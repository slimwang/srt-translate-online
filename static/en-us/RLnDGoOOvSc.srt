1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,719
All right, give me a name.

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:03,300
>> Fredrick.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,070
>> Fredrick, okay.

4
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,150
And a verb?

5
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,540
>> Fly.
>> Fly, all right.

6
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,830
Plural noun.

7
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,510
>> Plural noun, camels.

8
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,730
>> Camels, that's a good one.

9
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,750
Occupation?

10
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,280
>> Occupation?

11
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,550
Yoga instructor.

12
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,050
>> Fair enough.

13
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,770
And a place?

14
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,620
Let's go with Disney Land.

15
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,900
>> All right, we've got our Mad Lib.

16
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,000
Do you want to go ahead and read it?

17
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,580
>> Sure.

18
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,240
Hi, my name is Frederick and
I really like to fly camels.

19
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,720
I'm also a yoga instructor
at Disney Land.

20
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,210
>> Well your name isn't Frederick,
your name is Sean.

21
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,840
And you will be seeing
a lot of Sean in stage two.

22
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,310
Sean, would you like to introduce
yourself and this project?

23
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,380
>> Sure, hi there.

24
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,140
My name is Sean Lubbers and I spent my
summer working as an intern at Udacity

25
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,480
to help improve this nanodegree.

26
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,230
You'll learn a lot of
programming fundamentals and

27
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,110
you'll apply what you learned in the
work sessions by building a couple of

28
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,320
versions of a Mad Libs generator,

29
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,860
with the final product looking like
the one you saw Andy and I just play.

30
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,850
>> Now, if you're not super excited
about learning how to build a Mad Libs

31
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,210
game, don't worry,
that's not really the point.

32
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,470
This is just a simple way to capture
a lot of the most important ideas

33
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,000
in programming.
