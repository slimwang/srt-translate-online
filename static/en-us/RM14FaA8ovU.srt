A class works great when you want to produce a fleet of similar objects as

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,939
with the target code in this run.js example.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,880
But what if you wanted a second category of objects that was

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,280
vaguely similar to this Car category?

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,280
Maybe you decide that in addition to enemy vans,

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,018
your game also needs cop cars that can be called to the player's aid.

7
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:21,900
So you decide that cops would behave pretty similarly to vans, but

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,140
they'd have a few important differences.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,320
You'd probably need to refactor this code so

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,680
that the cops can behave a little bit differently.

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,509
So imagine cal is going to be one of these cops.

12
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,960
The cal object ought to have all the same vehicular powers as the other two

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,970
cars did.

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,050
What function could you use to build this object?
