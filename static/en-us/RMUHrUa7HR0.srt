00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,850
Going back to D3's documentation, there
are a few more methods that we can use

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,080
in order to transform or
change DOM nodes.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,560
Now, you've already seen the style
function, but there's also others,

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,770
like text, html, and append.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,620
Also, notice that some of these
methods are both getters and setters.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,260
You set a value by passing in
a second parameter to the method,

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,000
just like we did with
the style function.

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,940
And back in the console,
remember that you can always figure out

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,450
what functions or methods are available
by using the autocomplete feature.

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,810
We can save a selection to a variable,
and

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,510
then quickly see which methods
are available on that selection.
