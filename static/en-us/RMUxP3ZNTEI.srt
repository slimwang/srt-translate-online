1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,819
We've got our canvas and

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:04,240
now we need to start thinking about how we're going to draw on it.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,610
To draw on the canvas, we're going to need to use coordinates.

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,210
Otherwise, how will the computer know where we

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,110
want our awesome drawings to end up?

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,830
In geometry class we use the cartesian coordinates system,

7
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,990
which looks like this.

8
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,070
The cartesian system has the X axis going from left to right, and

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,120
the Y axis going from bottom to top.

10
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,610
0, 0's right in the middle and any numbers below 0,

11
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,940
0 are negative on the Y axis.

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,090
And any numbers to the left of 0, 0 are negative on the X axis.

13
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,710
The canvas's coordinate system is a little bit different.

14
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:35,350
Here 0, 0 is in the top left, and our x numbers just get bigger as you

15
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,360
go to the right and our y numbers get bigger as you go down.

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,750
This is different than geometry class where number got more positive

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,780
as you go up.

18
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,770
So, they're opposites in a way.

19
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,600
Keep that in mind.

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,800
Let's take a look at a couple examples.

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,420
On this grid,

22
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,430
I'm counting ten lines as one, because these lines are too close together.

23
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,900
We've gone over ten lines, which we're counting as one, so we have x1.

24
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,060
And, we haven't gone down at all so y is still 0.

25
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,870
Looking at this one, we haven't gone anywhere on the x axis, so x is still 0.

26
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,270
But we've gone down ten lines or one line in this example.

27
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,340
So the y is 1.

28
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,080
For this last point, we've gone over ten lines.

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,050
So our x is 1.

30
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,920
And we've also gone down ten lines.

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,620
So our y is 1.

32
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,110
It's important that you get used to the canvas coordinate system,

33
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,090
because you're going to be using it quite a bit.

34
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,530
To get you started I've marked off three points.

35
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,730
A, B, and C.

36
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,100
See if you can figure out their coordinates.

37
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,070
I've also gone ahead and marked off the next whole numbers on the y axis and

38
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,990
the next whole numbers on the x axis to make your life a little bit easier.

39
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:35,930
