1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To put it with Steve McConnell,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
the goal of simplifying the test case is to make it so simple

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that changing any aspect of it changes the behavior of the error.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Or, in our words, to make it so simple that every aspect in it is relevant.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There is also a nice quote which is usually attributed to Albert Einstein.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This of course calls for a simple process for simplifying.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Namely, for every circumstance of the problem,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
check whether it's relevant for the problem to occur.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If it is not relevant, remove it from the problem report or the test case in question.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
To see whether you got all this, let's have a quiz.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Namely a word problem first stated by French novelist Gustave Flaubert in 1843.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
A ship sails the ocean.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It left Boston with a cargo of wool.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It grosses 200 tons.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It is bound for Le Havre in France.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The main mast is broken.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The cabin boy is on deck.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There are 12 passengers on board.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The wind is blowing east northeast.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The clock points to a quarter past 3 in the afternoon.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It is the month of May.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now, for the question. How old is the captain? Over to you?
