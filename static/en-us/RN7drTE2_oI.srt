1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,780
Alright, so to make this work, we're going to need to build on this

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,715
idea of a joint distribution. It's not going to be obvious right away what

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:08,952
this has to do with machine learning, at all. But, I, it's going to

4
00:00:08,952 --> 00:00:12,567
connect. So, just bear with me for a little bit. Alright, so to talk

5
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:15,760
about this concept, what we're going to do is look at an example. And

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,040
the example that I think might work, that would be nice and simple, is

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,390
the notion of storm and lightning. So, here's a little picture of storm

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,670
and lightning. And what we're going to do is say, let's say, on a random

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,730
day, at 2 PM. You look outside. And, what I want you to do

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,435
is say, what fraction of the time,

11
00:00:31,435 --> 00:00:34,650
is, is each of these different possible combination

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,240
of things happening? So, for example, what's

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,700
the probability that you look out and

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,420
there's a storm and there's lightning at the same time? So, what do you think?

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,640
>> On a random day?

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,380
>> Yeah, random day at 2 PM. And we

17
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,280
can be in Atlanta since that's what you're familiar with.

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,590
>> Is it summer? Because that happens more often in the summer.

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,733
>> Sure, let's say summer.

20
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:56,610
>> It's fairly high at 2 PM. Let's say it happens a quarter of the time.

21
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,920
>> Wow, that's a rainy summer.

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,330
>> Mm-hm.

23
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,920
>> Alright. Now, that's not the only possibility though. It

24
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,989
could also be that there's a storm but no lightning.

25
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:07,190
>> Right. That happens more often at 2 PM

26
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,818
in the summer in Atlanta. Let's say it's mm, .4.

27
00:01:10,818 --> 00:01:14,610
>> Wow. Alright. Now what's the probability that you look

28
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,780
at the window and there's no storm but there is lightning.

29
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,185
>> Maybe 5%.

30
00:01:18,185 --> 00:01:20,660
>> And what's the probability that you look out and

31
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,420
there's, you know, it's nice clear there's no storm no lightning.

32
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,760
>> Coincidentally I picked numbers that made it easier

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,195
for me to subtract from one. So, it's 0.3.

34
00:01:28,195 --> 00:01:31,550
>> [LAUGH] Right and so these, there's only, these are the only four

35
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,920
possibilities. We're saying. And they, so they have to add up to 100%. And

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,530
so I, yeah it had to be 30 at this point. So, it's

37
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,530
actually more likely that there's a storm than not, according to what you said.

38
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,202
>> It's Atlanta

39
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,280
in the summer at 2 PM.

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,470
>> There you go. Alright. So, this is a

41
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,900
joint distribution. And now we can actually ask various

42
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,850
kinds of questions about this. Oh, you know what

43
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,730
would be a good form for asking a question.

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,670
>> I don't know. I'm looking at you quizzically.

45
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,560
>> Nice. Using the fact that we are in

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,380
the same place. We are going to do a quiz.
