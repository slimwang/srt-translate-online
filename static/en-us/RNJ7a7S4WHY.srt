1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,920
Now lets go into the specific things and
implement a banner ad in our app.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,760
Here are the things we will do.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,790
In android manifest, we will add
an activity called AdActivity.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,160
Then its time to add code to
our Banner Activity to actually

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,270
display a banner ad.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,330
Then, we will add our banner
ad to banner activity.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,870
This involves adding a banner
ad to our layout file and

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,032
then adding code to display that ad.

9
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:32,619
Okay, so let's start to look at how we
add the AdActivity to our manifest file.

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:39,820
So if we open the manifest file,
this is how we add the AdActivity.

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,320
So you got the name of
the activity right here.

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,430
And then you have another attribute
called configChanges that you should set

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,420
to the following string.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,060
So what is this activity doing?

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,809
Because, as you can see, it is not an
activity that we have created ourselves.

16
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,060
This activity is used in banner ads
to actually launch the ad viewing

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,750
in case the user clicks on the ad.

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,620
And it's used in interstitial
ads to actually display the ad.

19
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,955
So where we press the Show
interstitial Button here.

20
00:01:08,955 --> 00:01:11,245
It is what makes this screen appear.

21
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:15,405
All right, so that's how we add
the AdActivity to the manifest file.

22
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:18,655
Let's now look at how we add
the banner ad to our layout file

23
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:20,320
in Banner Activity.

24
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,592
So if we open up the banner
activity layout file,

25
00:01:22,592 --> 00:01:26,690
you can see that we've created
the standard relative layout.

26
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,440
And the thing that we've added
to display a banner ad is this

27
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,250
AdView element here.

28
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,410
This is the definition of the banner
ad that will appear in this

29
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,920
relative layout.

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,760
And as you can see,

31
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,810
we have many standard android
attributes here to control the layout.

32
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,350
And then we also have two
specific attributes here

33
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,390
that controls the banner ad.

34
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,390
First we have ads:adSize which
controls the size of the ad.

35
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,610
There are many alternatives you can
specify for the size of the ad and

36
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,110
you can look these up
in the ad size class.

37
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,310
We're going to use
a constant called BANNER and

38
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,260
then we have something
called adUnitId here.

39
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,872
So what is this?

40
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:09,538
We'll adUnitId is the ID
of an ad placement.

41
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,280
So if we go back to this picture,

42
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,140
the ad unit ID is something we
define in the AdMob interface.

43
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,195
So when our app is requesting
an add using a specific ad unit ID,

44
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:24,985
then AdMob will know which type
of add to serve to your app.

45
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:28,375
With an add unit ID,
you can also specify the media type

46
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:33,947
that the add should be in, if it should
be an image, a text or a video clip.

47
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:35,527
But wait a minute, you may say now.

48
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:39,557
We haven't set up any account in AdMob
yet, and we're not ready to display and

49
00:02:39,557 --> 00:02:41,347
get paid for real ads yet.

50
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:44,497
We're just in development and
testing phase right now.

51
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,487
And that's correct.

52
00:02:45,487 --> 00:02:49,023
So before we show you how to
move your app to production,

53
00:02:49,023 --> 00:02:51,580
we will be using a test ad unit ID.

54
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,060
Let's go back to Android Studio.

55
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,600
So here's our definition
of the ad unit ID.

56
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,560
It's set to this string here.

57
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,130
And this particular adUnitId
is an ad unit ID for

58
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,880
banner ads that will serve test ads.

59
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,590
So this is the string that you
should use in your application now.

60
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,960
And as you can see, I've actually
not hard coded this string, but

61
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,660
it's a string resource.

62
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,030
So, in line with android best practices,

63
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,390
I've defined this string
resource over here in strings.

64
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:21,900
Here it is.

65
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,550
So now it's very important that you
enter exactly what it says here.

66
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,032
Otherwise this is not going to work.

67
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:31,910
All right,
let's go back to the layout file now.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,190
And now there's only one little thing
left before we can start coding.

69
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,160
Notice that these things don't
have the usual android prefix.

70
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,670
They have ads as the prefix.

71
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,880
Well by default, the ad's name
space is not included here so

72
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,830
we also need to add this line up here.

73
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:55,010
This line gets the ad:namespace
into the layout file so

74
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,340
you have to add that
otherwise this won't compile.

75
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,180
All right.
That's it for the layout file.

76
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,400
Let's now switch to Java and
see how we code the banner ad activity.

77
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,030
And you may be amazed
how simple this code is.

78
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,355
The first thing we need to do is declare
this member here, which is an AdView.

79
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:17,565
And after setting our layout, we
retrieve this view using findViewById.

80
00:04:18,685 --> 00:04:22,695
We then create an AdRequest
using a builder and

81
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:26,140
finally we load the adRequest,
into the view.

82
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,680
That's it.

83
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,820
With only those steps, we're able to
write an app that talks to AdMob and

84
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,160
gets us connected to a huge
advertising network that are eager for

85
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,540
you to show their ads and
are willing to pay for it.

86
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,440
So now it's your turn
to do these things.

87
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,530
Remember, add the AdActivity
to the manifest file.

88
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,500
Then, in the banner activity,
add the banner ad view to the layout and

89
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,020
then add the code to display the ad.

90
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,990
Check here when you are finished.

91
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,490
Good luck.
