00:00:02,723 --> 00:00:06,035
>> Right, so, I think I understand what's going on here. Take a look at this

00:00:06,035 --> 00:00:11,971
drawing of a road. It looks flat, but if we make the lines converge, like this,

4
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:17,353
the lines go off in the distance. Well, here we perceive depth and that's

5
00:00:17,353 --> 00:00:21,495
linear perspective. And, since we can close one eye and still see this depth

6
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:24,609
que, we call this a monocular depth que.

>> That's really interesting. So, speaking of monocular que's, now I think it's a

great time to go for a word from our sponsors.
