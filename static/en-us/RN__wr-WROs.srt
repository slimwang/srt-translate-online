00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,320
Open the spreadsheet for the data for miles traveled versus cost of various

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,920
flights. Try and make this scatter plot yourself within the Google doc. You

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,820
don't have to, but it's probably good to know how to do, then calculate R.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,970
Remember that the function in Google doc is Pearson, and then you'll enter the

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,420
name of the start cell for the x variables. Go all the way to the end cell for

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:30,450
the x variables. Comma, start cell for the y variables, colon, end cell for the

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,430
y variables. After you get this, enter the correlation coefficient here, round

8
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,443
to two decimal places.
