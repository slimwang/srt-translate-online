Let's bring the z table back again. So now our z score is 2.26. So here's 2.2,

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:15,832
and here is where it intersects 0.06. So the probability of getting a mean less

3
00:00:15,832 --> 00:00:23,415
than 40 is 0.9881. The probability of getting at least 40 is 1 minus 0.9881,

4
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:29,984
which is a far lower probability. So we have this really skinny sampling

5
00:00:29,984 --> 00:00:36,410
distribution and the probability of getting greater than 40 is very small,

6
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:43,192
0.0119. So getting a sample of size 250 with a mean of 40, is pretty unlikely to

7
00:00:43,192 --> 00:00:49,604
occur by chance. In this case, this shows some kind of relationship, probably,

8
00:00:49,604 --> 00:00:53,262
between the Bieber Tweeter, and Klout score.
