00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,400
So, in the previous lecture, we started looking at,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,230
how are we going to represent images as digital representations?

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,990
Now, let's start looking at what we can do with these images.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm just showing you again, a color and a black and white image.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,770
Now, what we want to do is we want to start looking at individual elements,

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,430
pixels, of each and every one of these images, and

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,920
start looking at what we can do by simply doing point-process arithmetic on it.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,800
That would allow us to start combining one image to the other.
