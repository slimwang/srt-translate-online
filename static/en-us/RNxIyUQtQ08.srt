00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here's my answer, so I took all the i, j, w pairs from the horizontal plays

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and just reassembled them with the i, j, putting in the indication that

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
they're going in the across direction and keeping the same word.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Then I do the same thing for the vertical plays. They came out in the j, i order.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I reassembled them back in the proper i, j order

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
with an indication that we are going in the down direction.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And then I took these two sets and just unioned them together.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now, I need some definition for across and down. I can do it this way.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I could have just used strings or any unique value that could use a string across and down,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
but I'm going to say that across is equal to incrementing one at a time in the i direction

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and zero in the j direction.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Down is incrementing zero in the i direction and one in the j direction.
