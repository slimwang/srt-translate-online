1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now, everything is in place so that you can compute

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
how to rescue Apollo 13, which is homework too.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You can use sine and cosine to make the moon go around the Earth.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You can use the differential equation to describe the motion of the spacecraft.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You know how to fire the rocket to decelerate the spacecraft

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
to take it to a low trajectory around the moon and you can compute

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
by how much to boost the rocket to guarantee a safe return to Earth.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The method to be using for that would be Heun's method

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
because we need a quite amount of accuracy.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This diagram is really not to scale the Earth and the moon are far more distant as shown here.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This figure 8 loop is much more narrow.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The packing orbit is pretty close to the surface of the Earth.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And this loop around the moon is much closer around the moon as you see here.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Actually, for the stimulation, we have to make this loop around the moon a little wider

15
00:01:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to not spend that much computation time on that.
