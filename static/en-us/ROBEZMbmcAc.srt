1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,977
So, we do still have the distance between negative 12 and 5, can be shown either

2
00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:07,881
by taking the absolute value of negative 12 minus 5, or by taking the absolute

3
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:11,992
value of 5 plus 12. You'd think, though, that there would be a consistent method

4
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:15,952
for finding what goes inside the absolute value signs, or finding the distance

5
00:00:15,952 --> 00:00:20,305
between two points. And, if fact there is. I'd like to remind you that 5 plus 12

6
00:00:20,305 --> 00:00:25,127
is actually equal to 5 minus negative 12. So I'm going to rewrite this absolute

7
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:30,112
value expression in this way. So considering this idea what would you say that

8
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:35,147
the absolute value of 14 plus 7 is the distance between? What are the two points

9
00:00:35,147 --> 00:00:37,825
that this measures the distance between?
