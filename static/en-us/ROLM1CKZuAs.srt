00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,939
In this lesson we'll talk about PowerBoost which is a traffic shaping

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,890
mechanism that was first deployed in commercial broadband

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:15,010
networks in June 2006 by Comcast. The PowerBoost allows

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:20,070
a subscriber to send at a higher rate for a

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,400
brief period of time. So if you subscribed at a rate of ten megabits per second,

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,290
then PowerBoost might allow you to send at a higher rate for some period of time

7
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:37,484
before being shaped back to the rate at which you were subscribed at. So,

8
00:00:37,484 --> 00:00:40,820
PowerBoost targets the Spare Capacity in the

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,000
network for use by subscribers who don't put

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,580
a sustained load on the network. There are two types of PowerBoosts. If the rate

11
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,970
at which the user can achieve during this burst window is set to not exceed

12
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:02,212
a particular rate. Then we say that the policy is capped PowerBoost, otherwise

13
00:01:02,212 --> 00:01:05,248
the policy, or the shaping, is called

14
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:09,364
uncapped PowerBoost. Now in the uncapped setting,

15
00:01:09,364 --> 00:01:15,629
the configuration is simple and as we described in the last lesson. The area

16
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:20,770
here is the PowerBoost bucket size. That's the maximum amount

17
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:26,030
of traffic that can be sent that exceeds the sustained rate.

18
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,030
The maximum sustained traffic rate is simply Rho,

19
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,770
as we've defined it before. Now suppose that we wanted to cap the rate that

20
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:40,810
the sender could send during the power boost window. Well all we need to do

21
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:47,520
in that case is to simply apply a second token bucket with another value of

22
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,503
Rho. That token bucket limits the peak sending rate for Power Boost eligible

23
00:01:54,503 --> 00:02:00,378
packets to the rate Rho C, where Rho C is larger than Rho. Remember

24
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:05,805
that this value of Rho also affects how quickly tokens can refill in the bucket,

25
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:08,395
so it also plays the role in the maximum

26
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:12,250
rate that can be sustained during a power boost window.
