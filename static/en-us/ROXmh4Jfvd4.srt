1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,020
Now let's do a quiz.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:06,610
For each statement, decide whether
it is true or false, using T for

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,150
true and F for false.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,588
First, a reflection attack is
a form of man-in-the-middle attack.

5
00:00:14,588 --> 00:00:19,650
Second, to defeat a reflection attack,
we can use an odd number as challenge

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,790
from the initiator and
even number from the responder.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,600
Third, we can use signing with public
keys to achieve mutual authentication.
