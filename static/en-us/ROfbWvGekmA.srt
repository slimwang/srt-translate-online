1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,214
So you've seen that the constant turn that we would get if we multiplied this

2
00:00:03,214 --> 00:00:06,142
entire right hand side of the equation out, is the product of the constant

3
00:00:06,142 --> 00:00:09,166
terms negative six, two and negative four from each of the original factors

4
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:14,675
that we had. So that means that this number 48 here is pretty intimately

5
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:19,343
related to the factors of this polynomial. That means that we should be able to

6
00:00:19,343 --> 00:00:24,250
use some information involving 48 to get to the roots of this polynomial.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,360
There's gotta be a pretty close connection there. So let's say we have some

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,900
fourth degree polynomials to add. Maybe it's this one, f of x equals x to the

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,470
4th minus 23x squared plus 18x plus 40. And maybe I've also come up with some

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,496
guesses for how to factor this polynomial. Let me write them down for you.

11
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,304
Which of these three choices down here do you think is the correct

12
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:49,527
factorization of this function? Remember to think about what we need in terms

13
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:51,303
of this constant up here.
