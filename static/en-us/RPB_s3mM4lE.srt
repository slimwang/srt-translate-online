1
00:00:00,196 --> 00:00:05,313
It will actually return a single row 
containing the max high temperature.

2
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:09,265
We're using a descending order 
for this column, which will place

3
00:00:09,265 --> 00:00:11,734
the largest value 
at the beginning of the query.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,728
The limit statement tells SQLite 
to only return a single row.

5
00:00:16,818 --> 00:00:19,719
We return a row 
that has the largest value.

6
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:22,515
If we wanted to get 
the most recent high,

7
00:00:22,515 --> 00:00:25,817
we could order by max desc, date desc.
