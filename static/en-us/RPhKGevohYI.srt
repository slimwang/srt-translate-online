00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,590
You have just seen how to write a program that determines the largest of a

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:08,572
number of input values, but that program had an annoying flaw. The user had to

3
00:00:08,572 --> 00:00:11,286
type in all of the values and if there are a lot of them that can get really

4
00:00:11,286 --> 00:00:15,921
tedious. What we really want to do is read the values from a file. To read a

5
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:20,965
value from a file, you can use the scanner class. But you construct the scanner

6
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:25,780
with an object of a file class. And in turn you need to construct that file

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,966
object by giving the name of the input file. Now, there's a bit of a catch

8
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:33,748
here, when we put this code inside the main method, we need to deal with the

9
00:00:33,748 --> 00:00:39,669
possibility that there is no file called input.text. If that file was indeed

10
00:00:39,669 --> 00:00:43,634
missing, then the file constructor would terminate with what's called a file

11
00:00:43,634 --> 00:00:48,810
not found exception. That exception is considered so serious that we must tell

12
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,676
Java that we are aware of it. That's done by putting this class throws

13
00:00:53,676 --> 00:00:58,679
FileNotFoundException behind main. We're not covering exception handling in

14
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,151
this course, so this is just another one of those things that I'm going to have

15
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:07,023
to ask you to just do. Once we're done with this, everything else is easy, now

16
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:11,894
the scanner works. Every bit as the scanner you've been using quite a bit. You

17
00:01:11,894 --> 00:01:16,500
can simply call has next double, and then read a value by calling next double.

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,106
Well, have a go at it. Modify the program that computes the largest value, so

19
00:01:21,106 --> 00:01:24,380
that it reads the values from a file.
