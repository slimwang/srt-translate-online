00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,666
Well, we know we invested a total amount of $10,000. So x plus y must be 10,000.

2
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:09,185
If I solve for y here, I know that number must be 7,500. Great thinking if you

3
00:00:09,185 --> 00:00:13,434
got that right. We know when we plug in the values for x and y, we get a true

4
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:17,948
statement in this first equation. And it turns out if we plug in x and y in our

5
00:00:17,948 --> 00:00:22,588
second equation, we'll also get a true statement. [inaudible] Try working out

6
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:26,570
this math to make sure that we have the right answer. The equations are checked,

7
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,156
which means that we have the correct x and y. It works in both equations.
