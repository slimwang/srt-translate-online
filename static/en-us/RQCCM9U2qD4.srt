1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,910
So now that we've gone through
this exercise let's put these

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:02,719
pieces together.

3
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,750
We showed three separate results
that being able to find the best, or

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,990
nearly the best,
let's you make few mistakes.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,550
Being able to make few mistakes let's
you do well on average per step.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,360
Being able to do well
on average per step

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,900
gives you the ability to
actually find a nearly best arm.

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,820
So, all these things
are actually equivalent.

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,340
If you give me an algorithm for

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,640
doing any one of these, I can derive
something for doing the other two.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,700
Just kind of do it in a circle here.

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,780
So, in a sense what
this is telling us is,

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,420
that we kind of don't have to
pick among these three different

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,410
optimality criteria because they're
really all the same as each other.

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,880
And you could sort of say, well and

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,070
it must be that these are the right
ones to think about because

17
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,610
even if we don't think about this
doing well on average per step,

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,050
we would have to solve it anyway if we
cared about any of these other things.

19
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,740
So,
>> Hm.

20
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,590
>> I don't know.

21
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,420
What I get out of this is the idea that
whichever of these is most convenient

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,180
for you to work with,

23
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,239
you should just work with it because
the other ones are going to fall out.

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,620
And there's other optimality criteria
that you could worry about, but

25
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,400
I don't know, it seems like a lot
of them come back down to these.

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,630
>> Yeah, I like that a lot.

27
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,310
You're really saying that they're
kind of in an equivalence class

28
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,060
of difficulty.

29
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,030
>> Yes.

30
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,220
Now interestingly,
the thing that we haven't done yet, and

31
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,600
that we need to do, is show that we
can solve any of these problems.

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,380
I thought we just did.

33
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,095
We put a lot of words on some
screens and there were some taus.

34
00:01:25,095 --> 00:01:26,690
>> [LAUGH] No, no, no.

35
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,300
No, what we showed was that if you could
solve one, you could solve the other.

36
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,790
If you could solve that one,
you could solve.

37
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,570
But, we never said that any of
these are actually solvable.

38
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,310
So, we need one more result to
kind of make this all doable.

39
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,890
>> Okay, that's fair, but
I was satisfied with proof by tau,

40
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,230
but if you want to actually go and
ground it out.

41
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,450
>> Yeah, but the taus were all
defined in terms of other taus.

42
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,328
It never bottomed out.

43
00:01:49,328 --> 00:01:51,365
Right, what'd we'd really
like is something that says,

44
00:01:51,365 --> 00:01:55,055
here is an algorithm that will in
a polynomial number of trials find you

45
00:01:55,055 --> 00:01:56,435
a nearly optimal arm.

46
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:58,225
>> I don't know, Michael, it seems to
me this is pretty straight forward.

47
00:01:58,225 --> 00:01:59,325
It's taus all the way down.

48
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:00,975
>> It can't be taus all the way down.

49
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:01,865
>> Why not?
It's turtles,

50
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:03,215
they start with the same sound.

51
00:02:03,215 --> 00:02:03,875
>> That's true.

52
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,055
I guess they're Greek turtles.

53
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:07,115
>> Yes,
it's Greek turtles all the way down,

54
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:08,365
which is what we've always suspected.
