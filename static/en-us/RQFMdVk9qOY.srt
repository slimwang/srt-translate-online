1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,053
Well as we'll see, the correct answer is actually 21 trillion, which is 16 factorial.

2
00:00:05,053 --> 00:00:07,032
Let's see how that works.

3
00:00:07,047 --> 00:00:09,679
So here I'm just going to run this program in my terminal,

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,889
and as you can see, the blocks complete in some basically random order:

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:18,087
block 7 completes, then block 6, then 1, then 0, and so forth.

6
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:20,833
If I run it again, I get a different order

7
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,460
and a different order and so forth.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,596
You'll find that the blocks executed in a different order every time,

9
00:00:26,596 --> 00:00:31,108
which is where that number 16 factorial comes from.
