1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,266
And the answer there is there are three Pareto-optimal solutions, here, here and here.

2
00:00:05,267 --> 00:00:08,399
Everything but the top left. Let's see why.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,799
So a Pareto-optimal solution is one where nobody can unilaterally switch their strategies to improve themselves

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,799
without making someone else worse off.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,366
Let's start up here. So here, B has a reward of zero, that's the best anybody could hope for,

6
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:31,366
so B doesn't want to switch. A would like to switch over here, but that would make B worse off.

7
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:38,932
Similarly, over here, A is happy to stay there, B would like to switch, but that would make A worse off.

8
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:46,066
And same thing over here. If A switches, it makes B worse, and if B switches, it makes A worse.

9
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:52,333
So all three of these are Pareto-optimal, whereas this one is not.
