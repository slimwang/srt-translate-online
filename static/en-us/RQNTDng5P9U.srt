00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,300
R would equal a plus s divided by s minus a fantastic algebra skills for giving

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,502
that one correct. If you stumble a bit then lets see how we do this, there was a

3
00:00:10,502 --> 00:00:15,731
factoring part to this so that might have been tricky first we multiply both

4
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:20,711
sides by the LCD r, r minus 1 we distribute the s to get sr minus s is equal to

5
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:25,999
ar plus a we also have to distribute the a here Now, I'm at this point. And this

6
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:30,488
is where I need to think back for what I'm solving for. I'm solving for r. So

7
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:34,961
let's get these r terms on 1 side of our equation. And these other variable

8
00:00:34,961 --> 00:00:40,801
terms here. So we'll have sr minus ar minus s equals a. We get this from

9
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:45,188
subtracting ar from both sides of our equation. If we add s to both sides. We'll

10
00:00:45,188 --> 00:00:50,304
have the r terms on one side of the equation. And now we want to factor. We take

11
00:00:50,304 --> 00:00:55,281
r out from each of these terms, and then divide each side of this equation by s

12
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:59,250
minus a. This gives us our final answer. And remember that these two equations

13
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,233
are actually the same. A plus s in the numerator is the same as s plus a.
