00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,254
Well, you already calculated the population standard deviation. And the standard

2
00:00:05,254 --> 00:00:11,826
deviation of this sampling distribution will be the population standard

3
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:18,610
deviation, divided by root n, which is 1.7078, divided by the square root of 5

4
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:23,819
this time, which is .76. This is less than the standard error we got before.
