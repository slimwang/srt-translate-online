1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This final question is motivated by structure from motion,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and it's not the full-blown structure from motion problem,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
which is hard to do on a piece of paper here.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
But it's a variant event for which I know the motion but not the structure.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Suppose we are given two cameras,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and we happen to know there are three features in the scene.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
All three features can be scene by both cameras.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This camera will see a feature on the left, in the center, and on the right--L, C, R.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This camera is camera A.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
One camera B, we also see a feature on the left, center, and right,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but I don't know the identity of those features, which I will call 1, 2, and 3.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Suppose in camera A we see from left to the right the following sequence: 1, 2, 3.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
These are the features numbers.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So in the left camera we notice that the left-most visible feature is feature 1,

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
the center feature is feature number 2, and the right feature is feature number 3.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm going to ask what is the order of those pixels in camera B,

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
assuming that the features are located as shown over here and so are the cameras.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Please give the index of the features over here that clearly have to be 1, 2, and 3

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
in some order which you have to determine.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
For a different configuration let's now assume we get to see 1, 2, 3 in camera B,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and we care about the feature indices we see in camera A

22
00:01:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that corresponds to those features over here.
