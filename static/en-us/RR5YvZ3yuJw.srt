1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,192
So, the way I think about
industry events are,

2
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:07,365
I wanted to use these events as
an opportunity to meet potential users.

3
00:00:07,365 --> 00:00:08,757
So when I was just starting out,

4
00:00:08,757 --> 00:00:11,060
I was looking to meet people
who are into sharing.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,270
So, I went to meetups that
are around recycling and sharing and

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,500
things like that.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,786
Just so I can talk to people and

8
00:00:16,786 --> 00:00:20,094
tell them, hey look this is what I want
to build, what do you think about it?

9
00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:21,858
Would you use something like that?

10
00:00:21,858 --> 00:00:24,790
And those have been really,
really useful.

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,180
The other type of industry events
are just those events where you go

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:36,835
to mingle and meet other entrepreneurs
and investors, and just kind of network.

13
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:38,379
I went to some of those.

14
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:42,779
I have to say that after attending a
few, I just completely stopped going and

15
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:45,210
realized this is not my way to network.

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,340
And I should be getting work done and
getting the traction with my product,

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,450
and then meet the right people
who see that this is working and

18
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,380
it's interesting for them.

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,320
>> In order to get noticed, in events or
anywhere, if you're networking.

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,560
You need to do something
that people care about,

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,280
that people would want to interact with.

22
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,254
So, even if it's a very serious trade
show with a lot of people with the suits

23
00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:13,837
that are looking for specific things.

24
00:01:13,837 --> 00:01:17,144
If you're going to be fun and
open and engaging,

25
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:19,820
people are going to notice you.

26
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,996
I saw people walking around with
comedians that are giving them,

27
00:01:24,996 --> 00:01:28,207
if you talk of me,
I will tell you a joke.

28
00:01:28,207 --> 00:01:32,953
Or, we're doing a paintable party later.

29
00:01:32,953 --> 00:01:35,680
Or we're offering a yoga
class in the morning.

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,990
Do you want to sign up?

31
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,823
Stuff like that, that people are not
expecting to get in conferences.

32
00:01:41,823 --> 00:01:46,430
People are not expecting to get in those
places, this can really make a change.
