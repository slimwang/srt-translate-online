00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:03,321
When we push branch a, Git will start form the tip e53 and

2
00:00:03,321 --> 00:00:07,425
trace back to find all the commits that are reachable from that commit and

3
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:10,934
send the ones that aren't already on the GitHub repository.

4
00:00:10,934 --> 00:00:14,920
So e53 and fd2 will both be sent.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,830
But 6b4 won't, since it's not reachable from branch a.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,550
And a3b won't, because it's already on the remote repository.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,360
So after the push, the GitHub repository will look like this.
