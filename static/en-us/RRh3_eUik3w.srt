1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Rank the following four scatter plots by their correlation coefficient.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
One should have the lowest coefficient.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Four should have the highest.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Note that you're ranking by the coefficient itself, not the absolute value, so sign does matter.
