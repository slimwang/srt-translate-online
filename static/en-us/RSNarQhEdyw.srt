00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,590
You may have a lot of data available
to you in your organization.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,560
In this lesson,
we're going to think outside of the box

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,020
in terms of all the data that
we can use in our analytics.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,520
We'll also look into the format of data,
and why it's important for

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,185
it to be in the most
efficient format possible.

6
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:22,934
[SOUND] By the end of a lesson, we'll
be able to input a data into Alteryx,

7
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:26,330
recognize its structural
issues if any and

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,404
optimize the field types
to best fit with our data.

9
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:31,490
Let's dive in.
