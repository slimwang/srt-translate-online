1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,840
Our first step is to substitue this value of r into the equation. Now we need

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,701
to work toward isolating t so I'm going to divide both side of the equation by

3
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:16,250
this coefficient out here, ten to the negative 12. That leaves us with 0.795

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:23,610
equals e to the negative t over 8223. Now what we need to do is get t out of

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:29,160
the exponent. So what do we need to do? Well, we need to take a log. Since e is

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,580
the base of our exponent here, our log should have the same base. That means we

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,970
need to take the natural log of both sides. On the left side, that's just going

8
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,360
to give us some number that we can calculate with a calculator. But, over here

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,880
something a little bit more interesting is happening. We have two inverse

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,627
operations that are going to cancel one another out. Leaving us with just the

11
00:00:50,627 --> 00:00:56,050
exponent as the entire quantity on the side. I'll leave the left side as is for

12
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:04,700
now. So we have natural log of .795 is equal to negative t over 8223. Now it's

13
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,830
easy. All we need is a little bit of multiplication. We need to multiply both

14
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:18,770
sides by negative 8223. So that leaves us with t equals negative 8223 times the

15
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,100
natural log of 0.795. Lets pull out our calculator to figure out what number

16
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,152
this is equal to. Using a calculator and rounding gives us a value of t of

17
00:01:29,152 --> 00:01:37,540
about 1886. So this piece of parchment from the dead sea scrolls is about 1886

18
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:43,410
years old. Now, in a real situation, estimates are a bit better than this. They

19
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,090
are calibrated using, for example, tree rings to determine a slightly more

20
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:52,340
accurate amount of carbon-14 in the plant material at a given time. Still, it's

21
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,110
pretty awesome that we can even come up with any sort of estimate.
