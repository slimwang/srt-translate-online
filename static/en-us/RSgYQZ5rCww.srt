1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,530
All right.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,970
That ends, the lesson on RANSAC, the subunit on

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,880
fitting models based on features, and in fact, the entire unit on features.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,570
This kind of work, finding features, figuring out how they match,

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,330
is, pervasive in sort of geometric computer vision.

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,950
The computer vision that talks all about how cameras align, and scenes, and

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,970
depths, and, and, and points.

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,190
And, so they, they, they use a lot, these days,

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,149
because of the, just how ubiquitous, imagery and, and video is.

10
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:36,740
and, because these, these methods are sort of powerful and

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,880
real, and not just myth, they are used in lots of real applications.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,710
So, I expect that if you end up doing any work,

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,250
that involves dealing with multiple images and

14
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,230
trying to figure out something about the relationship between them,

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,100
that you will actually see things like, PARIS detectors,

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,001
things like the SIFT descriptors and certainly things like the RANSAC alignment.
