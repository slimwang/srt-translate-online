00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let me just fill in the table over here. 3, 0, -3.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In our equation, this term doesn't change because it only depends on x

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and I haven't changed x at all.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
But let's compute the numerator over here.
