Solomon Asch found that 76% of the people conformed with a group approximately

2
00:00:05,036 --> 00:00:10,317
37% of the time. So conformity is when people change their behavior to adjust

3
00:00:10,317 --> 00:00:14,056
to what others are doing. Or they change their behavior to adhere to cultural

4
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:18,611
norms. And as we see, people go to great lengths to conform with others. And

5
00:00:18,611 --> 00:00:22,772
this often happens in decision making. And psychologists have a technical term

6
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:26,531
for this and it's called group think. And group think can be dangerous because

7
00:00:26,531 --> 00:00:30,041
an individual may forego critical analysis or logic in attempts just to fit in

8
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:35,652
with the group. For example, some psychologists and historians have suggested

9
00:00:35,652 --> 00:00:40,260
that Kennedy's behavior in the Bay of Pigs actually resulted from group think.
