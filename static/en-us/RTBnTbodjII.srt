00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,590
>> Okay, fair enough, now of course if instead of reels,

2
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:20,880
we had complex result, okay, then we wouldn't have the same precondition, but

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,960
deciding what the form of the. Output is whether it's real or

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,250
complex is an important part of the specification process. For

5
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,670
this particular exercise, we're going to go with, go with the real numbers and

6
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,010
the precondition says that X which is our input argument is greater than or

7
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,220
equal to zero. Notice that were not saying what happens if.

8
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:49,710
X is less than zero. We're specifying the behavior of the function

9
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,530
in terms of what does this function mean when it gets expected arguments? Now,

10
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:02,050
if you wanted to have a variant. Which worked on any argument.

11
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:08,130
But race and exception or produced a return code if x was less than 0.

12
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,980
We could specify that as well. But we're going to keep it simple for

13
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,810
now and really say we're defining square root over the non-negative reels.
