00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,050
>> Programming with objects is the predominant way of developing software today.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,760
>> Code is organized into pieces called objects. You can use objects written by

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,940
other people to create your own programs.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,990
>> That way, you get to stand on the shoulders of giants instead of having to

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,225
start from scratch every time.

6
00:00:14,225 --> 00:00:17,900
>> In this lesson, you'll look at lots of different examples of objects. You'll

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,360
learn what they can do and how to make them do it.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,470
>> At the end of this lesson, you'll be able to write a program that draws a

9
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,670
rocket, flying from earth to mars. I think you'll be impressed with what you'll

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,930
able to do.

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,200
>> I'm really excited of what you're going to learn this lesson. Let's get

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,470
started.
