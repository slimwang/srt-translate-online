1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
For this problem, we've taken a list p,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and we want to return each value in the list multiplied by each other.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The multiplicative identity is 1.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's start total as 1.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The reason we do this is because it works for any value of p[0] against which we multiply.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We're then going to go through the list and multiply our incrementing total by each value.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
At the end we're going to return total. That's it.
