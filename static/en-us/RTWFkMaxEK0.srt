1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,480
We saw in the previous example how sentences in a story can be ambiguous. For

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,220
example, by, could have referred to an agent, a conveyance, or a location.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,665
This is true, not just for prepositions, but is also true of other [UNKNOWN]

4
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:20,270
categories, like words. In fact, words often can have several interpretations.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,280
Let us consider the word take as an example. Take is a very common word.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,660
It has at least these 12 different meanings. Consider for instance to medicate.

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,580
Ashok took an aspirin. Here, the meaning is that Ashok took

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,620
aspirin as a medication. Each of these meanings has a common meaning of take,

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,730
as we will say in just a minute. But given a sentence in which take occurs,

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,630
how do we know which of these meanings is intended by the word,

11
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,810
take? So suppose the input sentence was, my doctor took my blood pressure.

12
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,700
The taken in this sentence refers to, to measure and not to any of the others.

13
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:01,010
Let us examine this issue further. So, for each of these 12 interpretations of

14
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:06,900
take, we have a frame-like representation. So take 1 to take 12.

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,950
Each of this frame-like representation specifies the thematic roles that go with

16
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,400
that particular meaning of take. So in this particular meaning of take, take 1,

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,530
we have an agent and an object. In this meaning of take, take 12.

18
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,950
We have an agent, an article, and a particle. Another word that typically occurs

19
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:32,400
with take which signifies this meaning, so to take clothes off from a body.

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,210
Let us consider another example of particle. Let us consider take11.

21
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,980
The meaning of this take is to assume control, as in to assume control of

22
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,570
a company, or to assume control of a country. When the meaning is

23
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:51,290
intended to be to assume control, then take typically occurs with the word over.

24
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,780
Take over a company. Take over a country. So, over then is a particle that

25
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,340
signifies this eleventh meaning of take. To go deeper into story understanding,

26
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,790
consider the simple story I took the candy from the baby. What is the meaning of

27
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,070
the word take here? You and I get this immediately, but how can an agent get it?

28
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,500
To keep it simple, we have shown here just nine meanings of take, you could have

29
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,050
added the other three as well. Although we started with bottom-up processing,

30
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,010
we're now going to shift to top-down processing. Because there's something about

31
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,370
the background knowledge about candy that we have, which is going to eliminate

32
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,410
lots of choice. In particular, we know that candy is not a medicine, so

33
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,290
this particular choice goes away. We know that candy is not a quantity, so

34
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,320
this choice goes away. Several of these choices disappear,

35
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,550
because of our background knowledge of candy. Just like some of the constraints

36
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,190
came from our background knowledge of the semantic category of candy,

37
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,900
other constraints come from our background knowledge of the preposition,

38
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,420
from. In the table showing prepositions earlier, from referred to a source.

39
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,050
These three frames do not have anything to do with the source, and

40
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,370
therefore we eliminate them. We're left only with this particular frame,

41
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,480
which has source in it as required by the preposition from. And thus we decide

42
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,920
that the interpretation of took in this particular sentence is to steal from

43
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,840
a baby. And thus we infer the correct interpretation of take, in this particular

44
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,240
sentence. It refers to, to steal. This is the only frame that is still active
