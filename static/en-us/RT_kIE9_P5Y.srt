00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,290
You should have a good start
with Youdask A Task 2.0, but

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,390
there's still quite a ways to go.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,820
And since we know you love lists,
here's another list.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,140
A list of requirements to help you keep
track of when needs to be done for

00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:12,650
this project.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,190
We also want to remind you that in
addition to getting your code to work,

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,120
don't forget to submit your reflections
describing the new features

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,314
of your choice that you
added to Youdask A Task 2.0
