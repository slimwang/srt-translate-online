00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,318
>> Now, in the process of needing to fill our canvas tiles, the method of

2
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:07,091
drawing is a little bit different than what we were doing before. Previously,

3
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:10,726
we're actually just taking a view rect and actually filling the data in. But

4
00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:14,502
now, what we need to do is actually take that same logic, which we've actually

5
00:00:14,502 --> 00:00:18,416
re-factored for you here. And instead of drawing it based upon the view rect, we

6
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:22,310
need to modify it to render tiles into the CanvasTile boundaries that are being

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,120
passed into the function. This works that once each of your CanvasTiles have

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,837
been created, you can actually pass it off to the fillCanvasTile function,

9
00:00:29,837 --> 00:00:33,786
giving it the newly created CanvasTile. Now, the code that we've provided here

10
00:00:33,786 --> 00:00:37,809
is essentially the same as our previous draw code, just refactored. The primary

11
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:41,579
difference is that our fillCanvasTile code should now take a CanvasTile, as a

12
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,356
parameter, and then draw to that CanvasTile's context. Using its bounding

13
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:48,110
information, rather than our primary canvas context.
