1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,660
Let's take a look at the answer.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,720
That's right, this floating circular
button here casts a large shadow on

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,840
the other surfaces in our interface,
so it must be the highest surface.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,360
Next is the blue surface just below it.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,630
And then lowest in the hierarchy
is the background surface.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,700
You might not have caught it, but

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,230
there is a slight shadow that the blue
surface is casting on the background.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,350
Just by looking at the screen, even
without any text or icons to guide us,

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,360
we can immediately establish a sense
of the hierarchy of these UI elements,

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,830
the higher ones commanding
the most visual attention.
