00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,318
And we're back at the Udacity Sense Olympics. Andy, can you give us an overview

3
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:07,584
of what's been going on?

4
00:00:07,584 --> 00:00:11,648
>> Yeah. So, we've had four events so far. And in this first event, we found that

5
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:16,810
our contestants could only detect a difference in weight of about 3%. In the

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,042
second, our contestants identified the five primary flavors. And in these last

7
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:24,885
two events, we discovered or pushed the limits of the thresholds of human

8
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:29,926
hearing. What we learn is that humans can really hear between 20 and 20,000 Hz

9
00:00:29,926 --> 00:00:34,200
and that the quietest sound we can hear is about 0 dB.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,835
>> Well, Andy, somethings been bothering me. How exactly does hearing work?

11
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:40,805
>> What do you mean by that? That's a pretty big question.

12
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:44,705
>> Well, okay, so I know sound vibrates the air but once those vibrations get into

13
00:00:44,705 --> 00:00:48,065
my ear, how do I perceive that sound?

14
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:51,840
>> That's, that's a really good question. And actually, the transduction of a

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,579
sound wave to a perceived sound is a pretty complicated process.
