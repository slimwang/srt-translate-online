00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So, let me ask you another quiz.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What type of filter do we need

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to find horizontal edges?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And here are the choices.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We have a filter like this, 1 and 1,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
horizontal filter 1, -1,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and a vertical filter, 1, 1 and 1, -1.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
One of those is actually correct,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so pick the one that is best suited to find horizontal edges.
