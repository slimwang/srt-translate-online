1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,060
All of these commits will be shown,

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,490
including the ones that don't have check boxes next to them.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,350
We just thought it'd be kind of tedious for you to check all the boxes.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,660
This one on the other hand,

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,690
won't be included, because it's not reachable by this commit.

6
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,430
You might be wondering what order Git will show these commits in,

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,440
since there are two separate paths.

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,410
The answer is that the commits are sorted by the time they were created.

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,720
So, the commits from the two branches might be shown as interleaved.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,010
Now Caroline will walk you through actually doing the merge and

11
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:25,640
deleting the branch.
