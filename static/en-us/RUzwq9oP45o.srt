1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,509
In exercise four, we need to modify
the adapter even further, and instead of

2
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:08,539
just passing in the cursor account,
we need to pass the entire cursor so

3
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:11,349
that the adapter can extract
the guest information and

4
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:13,681
display it in the RecyclerView properly.

5
00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:17,605
In GuestListAdapter, since we're passing
in the entire cursor, rather than just

6
00:00:17,605 --> 00:00:23,449
a count, let's replace this integer with
a cursor variable called mCursor, and

7
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:28,070
then modify the constructor to accept
a new cursor, rather than an integer.

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,850
And inside, set the local
mCursor to be equal to cursor.

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,427
And then finally, update the
getItemCount to return the getCount from

10
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:38,659
the passed in cursor object.

11
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:41,750
Now, for the part where we bind
the cursor data with the UI, just like

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,980
a typical recycler view adapter, we
will override the onBindViewHolder, and

13
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:52,759
inside, by the data, the specified
position to the viewHolder passed in.

14
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,842
But before we do that,

15
00:00:53,843 --> 00:00:56,921
let's have a quick look at what
the result of a query looks like.

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,975
A result of any selection
query is formed as a table,

17
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:03,031
if you select everything
from a database table, and

18
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:05,680
the result table is
identical to that table.

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,512
A result of any selection
query is formatted as a table.

20
00:01:09,513 --> 00:01:11,638
If you select everything, for example,

21
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,920
then the result is identical
to that database table.

22
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,760
You can think of the cursor as
if it's pointing to a particular

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,370
row in that result.

24
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,590
To extract information from a particular
row, you can move the cursor to point

25
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,180
there, and then extract
the specific goal information.

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,050
For example,
to get the guest name in the fourth row,

27
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:32,170
move the cursor to the fourth position,
and

28
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,390
then call getString,
passing in the index of that column.

29
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,545
To do so in the onBindViewHolder,
first thing we need to do is call

30
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:45,393
the mCurser.movetoposition,
passing in the current binding position.

31
00:01:45,393 --> 00:01:49,174
And this will move the cursor to the
point where we have the data that we're

32
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:50,033
interested in.

33
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:52,704
It will return false,
if there's no data there, or

34
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:56,406
if it's out of the bounds of the cursor,
so make sure you add a check, and

35
00:01:56,406 --> 00:01:58,131
if it's not true, just return.

36
00:01:58,132 --> 00:02:01,445
If everything's good,
then we can get the name of the guest,

37
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:03,433
and the party size from that cursor.

38
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:06,709
To get the guest's name,
use mCursor.GetString.

39
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,070
And then passing
the index of that column,

40
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,074
which you can get also using the
getColumnIndex function in the cursor,

41
00:02:13,074 --> 00:02:17,224
and then just passing the column name,
which we can get from the contract.

42
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:19,304
The same can be done
to get the party size,

43
00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:22,706
except that we're using the get
integer instead of the get string.

44
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:27,760
Then to reflect this information in
the UI, we just set the text for

45
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,030
the holder.nameTextView and
.partySizeTextView.

46
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,067
We've already created all the UI for
you, however,

47
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:39,188
if you're interested, check out
this activity_main.xml file, and

48
00:02:39,187 --> 00:02:41,770
see how these text fields
have been created.

49
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,251
Now, the very last step is drop
date MainActivity, and instead of

50
00:02:46,252 --> 00:02:51,146
pausing in the getCount of the cursor,
just pause in the entire cursor.

51
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:55,734
And if we run this now, voila,
we get the actual names and

52
00:02:55,735 --> 00:02:59,857
party sizes for
each of our fake guests, perfect.

53
00:02:59,856 --> 00:03:02,954
Now, let's start adding guests
of our own, but as always,

54
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:05,590
remember to try everything
we've done yourself.
