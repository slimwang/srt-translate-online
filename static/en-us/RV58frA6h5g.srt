1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now that we understand how HTML works,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we want to separate out these tags from the words that will be displaced on the screen.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Breaking up words like this is actually a surprisingly common task in real life.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
For example, ancient Latin was often written or inscribed without spaces.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This particular set of letters "SENTATUSPOPULUSQUEROMANUS"

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is inscribed on the arch of Titus, which I've doodled over here as a column,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
but what can you do? Arches are apparently beyond my power.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I know. It has just become an arch. Those labels never lie.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Roman inscriptions like this were written without spaces,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and it requires a bit of domain knowledge to know how to break this up.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
"Senate and the People of Rome." That inscription was made quite some time ago.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Similarly, in many written Asian languages, they don't explicitly include spaces

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
or punctuations between the various characters or glyphs.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
In this particular Japanese example, and both my handwriting and my stroke order

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
are very, very poor--have pity--some amount of domain knowledge is required to break up

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
"ano" from "yama"--"that mountain."

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Finally,even if you're not familiar with Asian languages or ancient Latin,

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
you might have seen the same sort of thing in a much more modern guise,

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
in text messaging.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Some amount of domain knowledge is required to break this up into "I love you"

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
even though no particular spaces are given.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We will want to do the same thing for HTML to break it up into words

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
like "Wollstonecraft" and "wrote" that will appear on the screen

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
or this special left angle bracket slash maneuver that tells us that we're starting end tag,

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
this special word in the middle that tells us which tag it was,

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and then this closing right angle bracket.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Once again, for this HTML fragment we want to break it up into this first word,

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
the start of the closing tag, another word, the end of the closing tag,

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and then another word.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We're going to need to do this to write our web browser.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
In order to interpret HTML and JavaScript, we're going to have to break sentences down

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
into their component words to figure out what's going on.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This process is called--dun, dun, dun, dun-- lexical analysis.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Lexical here has the same roots and "lexicon" like a dictionary.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This means "to break something down into words."

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You'll be pleased to know that we're going to use regular expressions to solve this problem.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Here I've written another one of those decompositions.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We might have broken an HTML fragment down into these word-like objects,

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
but this time you're going to help me out by doing the problem in reverse.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So in this multiple multiple choice quiz, I'd like you to mark each one of these HTML fragments

41
00:02:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that would decompose into this sequence of five elements.
