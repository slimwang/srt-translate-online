1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,990
All right. If you had actually been here while we were recording this,

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,030
you would have seen that I just walked around the room 17 times trying to get my

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:06,670
act together.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,686
because I started to talk about this and my, my tongue just [SOUND].

5
00:00:10,686 --> 00:00:13,290
But, but here goes, okay?

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,490
Couple things, all right?

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,160
So, this relationship here,

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,620
that's the relationship that happens algebraically between corresponding points.

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,970
p and p prime are the image points of the same point outside in the world.

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,390
Now, we remember from our epipolar geometry, so like that's over here, that if

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,950
I've got some point let's say it's right here in the image, I know that that's

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:41,850
on this ray somewhere and therefore that point must be on that epipolar line.

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,240
That was the geometric constraint that we had derived earlier.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,960
So the p transpose Fp prime equals 0 is the algebraic one.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,430
The drawings that the epipolar lines is the geometric one.

16
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,500
But clearly, they relate.

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,890
So you'll remember from our projective geometry little tutorial that we

18
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,420
said that the equation of a line, right, could be written a couple ways.

19
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,840
I'm going to write it this way, p transpose l equals 0.

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,400
All right?

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,750
Remember l was the, that normal to the plane, and all the points p

22
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:20,480
had to be on that in that plane, and would be perpendicular to it.

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,950
So notice, here we have p transpose, here we have this p transpose,

24
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,630
here we have this l.

25
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,871
Here we have that l, that it here we have that Fp prime, okay?

26
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:37,400
These equal 0's align, that's the constraint that has to equal 0.

27
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:43,556
What this means and that's what's written here is that this l,

28
00:01:43,556 --> 00:01:50,180
which is Fp prime is actually the epipolar line in the p image, okay.

29
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,971
So remember it's mol, I'm going to to erase this, right?

30
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:56,230
It's going to be multiplying a point in the p image.

31
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:01,910
So l equals Fp prime is the epipolar line in the p

32
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:05,530
image associated with the point p prime.

33
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:12,540
Also just reversing this, that means that F transposed p is the epipolar

34
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,712
line in the prime image, the p prime image associated with the point p.

35
00:02:17,712 --> 00:02:19,300
All right?

36
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,070
So what the fundamental matrix does is it

37
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,800
gives us the epipolar line constraint between two views.

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,600
So if I know what F is I can compute the epipolar lines.

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,530
In fact, you can just for a given point I just take F transpose p and

40
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,050
that's the epipolar line in the other image.

41
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,110
And that makes sense because the F is what we said deri,

42
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,480
takes all of the, goes through the intrinsics of one,

43
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,320
through the extrinsics, the intrinsics of another.

44
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,950
And so the only thing I don't know for some point that I'm seeing in the,

45
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,830
in my left image is well, since I don't know its depth along that ray, I,

46
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,060
it has to be along this line, that was the geometry.

47
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,210
So, the fundamental matrix equation reduces that

48
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,540
geometric constraint to an algebraic one.

49
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,010
The great thing about video's you can go back and take a look at this.

50
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,350
We'll also, in the class notes,

51
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,610
there'll be some pointers to some texts where you can look at it and

52
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,230
learn it from people who are way more articulate than I am.

53
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,840
But that's relationship between the fundamental matrix.

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,010
And the epipolar lines.

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,420
Go back and look again.

56
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,340
Do it again. Okay, so now you're here and now you're really got it,

57
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,720
you understand it all, so you should really teach this class but I'm stuck here

58
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,980
on this side of the screen, you're stuck there so I'll keep going, okay?

59
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,480
Great.
