00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,640
We've talked about loading data from flat files by way of CSV, but a lot of the

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,320
time, the data that data scientists work with

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,340
are stored in relational databases. A relational database is

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,180
similar to a collection of spreadsheets. In each

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,180
spreadsheet, there are columns and rows. A column specifies

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,660
a value and its type such as player ID

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,330
or team ID or record. Each row contains values

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,465
for each column such as 1 or 1 or

9
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:33,240
245-150. Or 1 and Yankees, things like that. In

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,450
the database world, we call each set of rows

11
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,960
and columns a table rather than a spreadsheet. And the

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,160
tables are usually related to each other in some

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,880
way. It's very important to be somewhat familiar with relational

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,170
databases. Since they're used in so many places and

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,550
also since we'll be storing some of the data required

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,140
for our class project in a small database. Let's take some time and talk

17
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,870
briefly about how one can store and

18
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,980
retrieve data from relational databases. In this

19
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,920
course, we won't discuss the design of

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,129
databases. Topics like normalization, indices, keys, things

21
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,270
like that. Some of these topics will be covered in Data Wrangling with Mongo DB.
