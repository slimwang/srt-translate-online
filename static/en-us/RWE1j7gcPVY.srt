00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,400
So far we added code to put
one event into the data layer,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,160
just used by one trigger, and to trigger
two hits to analytics as a result.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,680
And we did this because I wanted you
to see that a trigger can be used

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,864
to trigger more than one thing, but stop
and think about whether it really makes

5
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:23,780
sense to track the opening of
an activity in multiple ways like this.

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,370
On the one hand,
we track the button clicks for

7
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,850
the Show Daily Special button.

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,510
But on the other hand, we track
the Show Daily Special screen views.

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,000
Really, we should only send one hit,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,410
when the user clicks
the Show Daily Special button.

11
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,030
Which tag do you think is
the right one to use in this case?

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,610
Go ahead and discuss in the forum.
