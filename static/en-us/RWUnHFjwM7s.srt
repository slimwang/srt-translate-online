[Evans] The final major concept we're going to introduce in this unit

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
is how to loop through a list.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Since loops are collections of things, it's very useful to be able to go through a list

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and do something with every element of the list.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
With the things we know so far, we already know enough to do this

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
if we put them together in the right way.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You should remember the while loop from the previous unit.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And as a reminder, this is the way the while loop works.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We have a while followed by a test expression,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
which is something that evaluates to true or false.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And when it evaluates to a true value, that means to execute the block,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
which can be a block of any number of statements we want.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And then at the end of the block we continue, go back to the while loop,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
try the test again, and we keep executing the block as long as the test evaluates to true.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So for this quiz we're going to see if you can figure out how to use while

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
to go through the elements of a list.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We're going to provide most of the code for you.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Our goal is to define a procedure called print<u>all</u>elements

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that takes as input a list.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We'll use the name p for the list.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Our goal is for that procedure to print out every element in the list.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I've written most of the code for this for you,

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but I've left out the test expression for the while.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So the code that's written introduces a variable named i,

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
initializes this value to 0, and we're going to use i to index through the elements of the list.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
For each element we print out that value, and then we increase i + 1.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So can you figure out the test expression we need for the while

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to make print<u>all</u>elements work,

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and what print<u>all</u>elements should do is print out every element in the input list p.
