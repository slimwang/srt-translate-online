1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,370
First, upload the malware
disguised as an app

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,700
without authorization bypassing
the review and check process.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,520
We know that's not possible
given the restricted

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,310
app distribution model by iOS.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,980
Second, uploading an app that
after it passed the review process

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,520
morphed into malware.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,230
This is possible and, indeed, this is
the method that the researcher had used.

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,850
In the spirit of full disclosure,
I was one of the researchers.

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:34,080
A link to an article about the research
can be found in the instructor's notes.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,130
Third, uploading an app that led users
to a site that contained malware.

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,120
This is not the method
that the researchers used.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,610
In effect, iOS would prevent malware
from being downloaded from a site and

13
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,530
run on the device.
