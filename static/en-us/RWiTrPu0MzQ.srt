00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,490
This is a fascinating, yet heartbreaking case, but it's a great way to start

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,440
this lesson because it shows us just how important our memory is to us as well

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,507
as our families. Now imagine being one of H. M.'s family members and watching

4
00:00:12,507 --> 00:00:16,329
him struggle with these profound memory problems. Or being one of the people

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,611
that he can't remember. That would be really difficult to deal with. Now even

6
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:25,694
though H.M. had profound amnesia, he was well aware of his memory problems. He

7
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:29,390
described it as constantly waking up from a dream he couldn't remember. Henry

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,590
Molaison contributed a great deal to the study of memory, as well as the areas

9
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:38,015
of the brain that are associated with forming and retrieving memories. After

10
00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:41,330
his death, his brain was donated to a group of researchers at the University of

11
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,316
California San Diego. Who provided imaging of his brain tissue to map the

12
00:00:46,316 --> 00:00:49,305
brain. If you're interested on learning more, we provided a link to their

13
00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:53,449
website. It's really fascinating, you should check it out. Now HM showed us

14
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:56,244
just how important our memory is for us to function as successful human beings

15
00:00:56,244 --> 00:01:01,202
in our everyday environment. Psychologists look at a lot of different types of

16
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:04,410
memory, but let's get started with just some of the basics for now.
