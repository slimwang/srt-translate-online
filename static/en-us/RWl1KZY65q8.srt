1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,100
Fundamentally, the use of dynamics,

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:08,960
is what's different between just doing
detection, and actually doing tracking.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,920
And that's shown as an example here.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,740
Here we have 20 frames taken.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,250
And here's some dude right there.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,650
You can see that he's
walking across all these.

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,600
And we just like to keep track of him.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,770
And of course, he's changing
his appearance every frame.

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,060
He's not going to look identical
from one frame to the next.

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,540
So, detection, we independently
detect the person each time.

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,390
Right?
So, we maybe have a little model of what

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,440
this person looks like, and
we run it maybe all over the image, and

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,376
we say uh-huh, you know, he's here.

14
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,138
Uh-huh, he's here.

15
00:00:39,138 --> 00:00:40,740
Uh-huh, he's there.

16
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,420
And, just these there.

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,990
No more uh-huh's,
cause it's like not exciting anymore.

18
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,500
Okay, so that's detection.

19
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,390
Tracking, we do a little different.

20
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,990
What we do is we predict
the new location

21
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,250
of the object based upon
the estimated dynamics.

22
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,570
And I say estimated dynamic, because for
example, this guy, he's walking, so

23
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,010
maybe we est,
maybe he's got a constant velocity, but

24
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,170
we don't know what that
velocity is a priority, right?

25
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,610
We have to estimate it, right?

26
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,390
So here we have an example
where we detect him here.

27
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,490
And it says, you know, we'll
estimate the velocity, but maybe we

28
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,520
estimated zero velocity, or we have some
prior reason to believe he's moving to

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,140
the left, because this is a sidewalk
where people move to the left often.

30
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,170
Fine.

31
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,520
That allows us to make
a prediction in the next image

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,250
of where that person will be and
then we detect them.

33
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,610
So now we can do two things.

34
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,350
First of all, we can improve our
estimate of where he is based upon both

35
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,340
our detection and our prediction.

36
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,340
And second, now we do have
a reasonable estimate of the velocity.

37
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,280
So we can use that velocity to predict
in the third fame, detect etc., etc.,

38
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,440
and we iterate.

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,430
So this is what the,
the basic tracking loop is.
