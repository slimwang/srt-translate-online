00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,560
So you're all comfortable
with your home directory, but

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,130
surely there's more to this
computer than just that.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,939
Right?

4
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,750
Oh yeah, there is a lot more.

5
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,480
So let's start exploring some
of the other areas of the Linux

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,790
operating system.

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,400
We'll do this by cding to the top
level root folder with cd /.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,200
If we ls -al this directory, we'll see
that there's a lot of content here.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,500
We're definitely not going to
cover all of these, but

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,010
we'll discuss the most
important folders.

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,740
We're already familiar with home,
but there are two other important

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,640
directories where you'll be making
lots of changes and editing files.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,290
Etc is where configuration files live.

14
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,550
As we start setting up our web and

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,270
database server, we'll be modifying
some files within this directory.

16
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,400
Var is for variable files.

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,100
Which is kind of an odd name.

18
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,830
Variable files are simply files
that you expect to grow or

19
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,190
change in size over time.

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,250
You'll typically find system and
application logs within this directory.

21
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,600
There are a few other directories that
are that are important for you to know,

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,840
but you probably won't be modifying or
directly interacting with them.

23
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,770
Bin is where executable
binaries are stored,

24
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,070
that are accessible by all users.

25
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,310
These are applications that you run,

26
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,380
like the LS command we've
used a few times already.

27
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,370
If you were to list
the contents of this directory,

28
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,810
you would actually see there's
a file called LS within it.

29
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,330
SBin is very similar to bin, except
that these binaries are to only be

30
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,670
used by the route user for system
administration and maintenance purposes.

31
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,600
We'll discuss some of the applications
within this directory a bit later.

32
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,400
Lib is for

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,460
libraries that support the binaries
that are located around the system.

34
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,330
Finally, usr is for user programs.

35
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,720
This could seem a bit confusing
compared to the bin directory.

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,070
The difference isn't that important.

37
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,770
The only difference really is that
the binaries within bin are required for

38
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,870
a boot-up and
system maintenance processes,

39
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,230
and the binaries in usr necessarily
aren't required for that.
