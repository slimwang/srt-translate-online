00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,150
Handling the Intent in
the Intent Service requires a few steps.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:09,090
First, you'll get the activity
recognition result from the Intent.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,883
Luckily enough,
that can be easily extracted using

4
00:00:11,883 --> 00:00:15,970
the .extractResult() method
on ActivityRecognitionResult.

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:20,870
This result will give you an array
list of detected activity objects

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,670
when you call the getProbableActivities(
) method on it.

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,240
Once you have this,

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,540
you need to create a new Intent on
which you're going to send the results.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,410
It's good to give it a name
with the package of your app or

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,050
something like that added to it,
something that's easily recognizable.

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,840
You should set this up as
a constant in a constants file.

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,070
Once you've got this new Intent,

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,030
you can then add the detected
activities array list onto it.

14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:52,070
And finally, use a LocalBroadcastManager
to broadcast the Intent so

15
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,390
that it can be picked up.

16
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:53,910
Go ahead and

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,370
implement the on handle Intent override
now, doing all of these steps.

18
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,220
You'll see the solution to
this in the next video.
