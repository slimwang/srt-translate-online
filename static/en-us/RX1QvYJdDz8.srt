1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,095
So, notice that in both cases, we're finding the distance between two points,

2
00:00:05,095 --> 00:00:10,721
here and here, and here and here. When we found the distance between these two

3
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:14,049
points, we set up a right triangle and found the horizontal distance between

4
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:18,848
them, and the vertical distance between them. This allowed us to use the

5
00:00:18,848 --> 00:00:22,502
Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse or the diagonal between the two

6
00:00:22,502 --> 00:00:28,748
points. The same was true in this case for town 2. We found the distance

7
00:00:28,748 --> 00:00:32,272
horizontally between the mile markers. And then the distance vertically, or

8
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:36,840
south to go to the town. We squared these two numbers and found their sum, and

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,315
then took the square root to get the distance. We can do something similar if

10
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:47,124
we wanted to find the distance between any two points. So, let's say we had

11
00:00:47,124 --> 00:00:52,306
these points, negative 7 and 3, and 5 and 8. We can think of drawing two

12
00:00:52,306 --> 00:00:57,788
interstates our roads, horizontally and vertically. And the distance between

13
00:00:57,788 --> 00:01:01,558
the two points is the diagonal, or the hypotenuse of the right triangle we just

14
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,134
created. To find the vertical distance between the two points, we want to look

15
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:10,636
at the y values. We can think about this vertical distance as starting at y

16
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:18,378
equals 3. Then it goes all the way up to y equals 8. So, if we find the

17
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:22,036
difference, or the amount between the y values, we'll get the vertical

18
00:01:22,036 --> 00:01:26,604
distance, which is 5 here. So, knowing this, what do you think would be the

19
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:29,279
horizontal distance? What's this distance?
