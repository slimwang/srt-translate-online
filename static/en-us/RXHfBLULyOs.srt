00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's an example of spelling correction in action.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Take the word w equals "thew,"

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and we want to find the correction c

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that maximizes the probability of w given c times the probability of c.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We start searching for the possible corrections c

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that are close to our target word "thew" in terms of added distance.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That is, first we start with all possible c that are one letter away,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
replacing one letter, swapping two letters, inserting one letter, or transposing two letters.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And here we have a list of a few of those possible corrections.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So it could be "the" by deleting the "w.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We could do no correction at all; we have to consider that as one of the possibilities.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We could replace the "e" with an "a."

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We could add a "r."

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We could transpose the "w" and the "e."

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Then we look into our spelling correction tables,

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and again we reduce them from a word-based to a letter- or edit-based,

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and we say what's the probability of inserting a "w."

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Here we've conditioned the insert not just absolutely of inserting a "w" anywhere,

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
but for insertions and deletions, we condition them on the previous letter.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So what's the possibility of inserting a "w" given that the previous letter was an "e?"

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It turns out that's what the probability is,

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and then we go through the list.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Here's replacing an "e" with an "a."

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's one of the most common edits made in English,

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
one of the most common spelling corrections.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
A 10th of a percent of all spelling errors are mistaking an "e" for an "a,"

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and similarly down the list.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So we get this probability for the probability of w given c,

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and then the probability of the correction word c,

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
that we just get by looking up in our corpus how many times we have seen this word

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and applying whatever smoothing we're getting.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Then we multiply them all out, and I've scaled these by a factor of 1 billion.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It turns out with the model I've built that "thew" is most probably corrected to "the."

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And that makes sense.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's easy to imagine your finger slipping off the "e" key and going over to

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
the "w" since they're next to each other,

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and "w" is a very common word in English.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But it's troubling that the second possibility,

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
namely leaving "thew" alone and keeping it as is has such a high probability.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Now, it turns out "thew" is a word.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's rather archaic. It does show up in the Shakespeare corpus.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It has to do with muscle tissue,

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
but it's a fairly uncommon word,

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and how high it ranks depends in large part on the probability that we assign

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
to this edit of doing nothing at all.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Here I've assigned it a probability of 0.95.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That is, I've said for my probabilistic model,

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I've made this choice to say I think that about 95% of the words are spelled correctly

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and 5% are spelled incorrectly.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You have to make that choice in order to have a complete model.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The probability distribution has to be spread out over all possible,

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and they have to sum up to one, so I've got to put it somewhere.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
If I had made another choice, then these two could have been swapped around.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So the answer you get depends on the assumptions you make.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Still, we can have spelling correcters that are highly accurate.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This very simple model of just looking at unigram possibilities

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and looking at the edits achieves accuracy in the 80% range.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If we go beyond that and start dealing with Markov assumptions

59
00:04:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and looking at multiple word sequences, then we can get up into the high 90%.
