00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,091
If we know that a quadratic equation has some number of solutions with an

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:08,720
imaginary component, then it has to have two of those kinds of solutions. So, in

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,968
other words, it has to have two complex solutions neither of which has a

4
00:00:12,968 --> 00:00:17,553
coefficient of b equal to 0. Let's look at the quadratic formula to think about

5
00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:21,946
why this is true. And the quadratic formula gives us solutions that are in this

6
00:00:21,946 --> 00:00:26,263
form. Let's write out the two solutions separately for the time being. Written

7
00:00:26,263 --> 00:00:30,395
out like this, we can see what may have seen hidden to you little bit before.

8
00:00:30,395 --> 00:00:34,619
The only difference between this solution and this one is that there is a plus

9
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,909
here between the negative b and this part, and there is a minus here between the

10
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:42,856
negative b and this part under the radical sign. Now, since we know the

11
00:00:42,856 --> 00:00:47,211
imaginary part of our solution has to come from this part with the radical, and

12
00:00:47,211 --> 00:00:51,596
what will happen, of course, only at the discriminate under here is negative.

13
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:56,022
That means, that these signs that are opposite one another are separating the

14
00:00:56,022 --> 00:01:00,830
real component of either solution from its imaginary component. That means, that

15
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:05,221
any time we find imaginary solutions, or complex solutions with nonzero

16
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:10,190
imaginary components for a quadratic equation, those 2 complex numbers are going

17
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:15,036
to be complex conjugates of one another. This is super powerful, super potent.

18
00:01:15,036 --> 00:01:19,722
We're going to continue to think about this concept through many of the coming

19
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:20,321
lessons.
