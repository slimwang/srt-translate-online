1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's introduce one more feature into our list comprehensions.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Remember ta_data and ta_facts.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
When we ran this, we got a list of strings

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which each contained a fact about a TA.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Like: Job lives in the USA,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and is the TA for CS387.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, what if we only want facts about TAs that don't live in the USA?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So, in this case that would be Gundega and Sarah.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Well, since these TAs are working remotely,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
let's call it remote<u>ta</u>facts,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and all we have to do is add a simple "if" statement.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And now when we run this, we only get these two strings

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
about Sarah and Gundega.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The addition we made was pretty intuitive.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This "if" statement just says: "If the country is not the USA,"

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
then we're going to add an entry

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
according to the rules we described earlier.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I hope you learned a lot about list comprehensions.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You should feel free to click the link below the video to learn even more,

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
but now it's time to practice.
