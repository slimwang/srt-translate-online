1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So what we're going to do the rest of this unit is look at 3 particular protocols.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We're going to look at the encrypted key exchange protocol,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
we're going to look at SSH for setting up a secure shell,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and we'll look at TLS, which is the most widely used cryptographic protocol today.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's the protocol that's used every time someone connects to a secure website

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
using HTTPS.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
All these have some things in common.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
They all have the goal of authenticating a client and a server.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This could be in either direction or in both directions.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It could be to allow a client to know that they're talking to the right server.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It could be to allow a server to know that they're talking to the right client.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It could be to mutually authenticate both parties.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And they all involve a mix of asymmetric and symmetric techniques.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What I hope you get from seeing the 3 different protocols

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
is a sense of some of the things that are the same--

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that there are techniques that all the protocols have in common at some level,

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
but there are also differences between the protocols,

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
the things that led to those decisions and why the protocols have different properties.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We'll start by talking about encrypted key exchange.
