00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,798
Here the length is 12 feet and the width is 9 feet. Great work if you found

2
00:00:04,798 --> 00:00:09,498
those. As always, we want to start by writing the two equations for perimeter

3
00:00:09,498 --> 00:00:13,596
and area. We know we're going to surround or enclose our sunroom with 42 feet

4
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:19,408
of screening. This means that 42 must be the perimeter. The area of the room is

5
00:00:19,408 --> 00:00:25,190
108 square feet. So, with area, we'll put 108. We'll rearrange this perimeter

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:31,199
equation to get 21 minus w equals l. We get that by dividing each of the terms

7
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,300
by two first, and then subtracting w from both sides. Now we're ready to

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:44,336
substitute. We replace l with it's equivalent expression, 21 minus w here. Then

9
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:50,875
we distribute w to each of the terms to get 108 equals 21 w minus w squared.

10
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:54,718
Next we want to set this equation equal to 0, so we'll move these two terms to

11
00:00:54,718 --> 00:01:00,650
the left side. So, our w squared term will end up being positive. So, adding w

12
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,126
squared to both sides, and subtracting 21 w from both sides we'll get this

13
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:10,419
equation. Next we want to factor this quadratic by finding factors of 108 that

14
00:01:10,419 --> 00:01:17,212
sum to negative 21. Those factors are negative 12 and negative 9. Then we set

15
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:23,571
this factor equal to 0, and this factor equal to 0. So, w can equal 12, or w

16
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:28,578
can equal 9. We know the width should be the shorter side, so we'll have this

17
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:33,708
width as 9 feet and this length as 12 feet. And as a quick check we can add up

18
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:39,204
all the sides to make sure that the sum is 42 feet, that's our perimeter. And

19
00:01:39,204 --> 00:01:43,628
finally we check the area by multiplying the width times the length. Or 9 times

20
00:01:43,628 --> 00:01:48,640
12 which equals 108 feet squared, our original area.
