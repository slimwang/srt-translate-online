00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,485
So, to recap, we see that humans begin to speak around the same time and follow

2
00:00:03,485 --> 00:00:08,402
predictable patterns of language development. We've seen the importance of

3
00:00:08,402 --> 00:00:11,900
nature, meaning the language areas of our brain, so the Wernicke's area and the

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,186
Broca's area, and nurture, meaning our exposure to models who imitate our

5
00:00:15,186 --> 00:00:20,572
language and reinforce our language. We saw that the amount of words a child is

6
00:00:20,572 --> 00:00:25,454
exposed to, is a function of nurture. Psychologists have different theories

7
00:00:25,454 --> 00:00:28,922
regarding language acquisition and there continues to be discussion regarding

8
00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:33,672
these theories. And finally we saw that other species can be taught to use

9
00:00:33,672 --> 00:00:37,312
American sign language and use it to communicate not only with humans but each

10
00:00:37,312 --> 00:00:41,790
other as well. Okay, so now let's move onto thought.
