1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And the answer is 95%, 19 out of the 20 hands have more fingers than the average of 4.95.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So 95% of the people could claim that their number of fingers per hand exceeds the average.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So it's pretty obvious to see that any percentages below 100 can be obtained--

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that is making a sequence of which the majority has one number 5 and very well exceptions

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
such as the 4 over here have fewer fingers.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is one in 20 that is 5% but as you draw more 5s,

7
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
you can make the percentage of these occurrences as small as you want.
