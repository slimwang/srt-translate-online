1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,020
So for this quiz, I want you to think about why

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,010
we're so focused on how time scales with the size of

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,040
the input, rather than the absolute time it takes for a

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,460
particular execution to run. Check all the answers that are correct.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,980
So the first choice is, we want to predict how long

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,410
it will take for a program to execute before we actually

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,490
run the program. The second choice is, we want to know

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,690
how the time will change as computers get faster. And through

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,460
the entire history of computing it's been the case that

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,700
the computer that you can buy for the same amount

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,540
of money a year from now is faster than the

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,840
computer that you can get for that price today. So

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,160
the third choice, we want to understand fundamental properties of

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,120
our algorithms, not things that are specific to a particular

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,818
input or machine. And the fourth choice is, we want

16
00:00:45,818 --> 00:00:47,980
abstract answers to make sure they can never be wrong.
