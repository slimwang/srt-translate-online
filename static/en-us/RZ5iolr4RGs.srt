1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
self-driving car engineers today used
two distinct approaches to autonomous

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,630
development a robotics approach and a
deep learning approach the robotics

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,160
approach uses output from a suite of
sensors to directly measure the vehicle

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,600
surroundings and then navigate
accordingly self-driving car engineers

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,900
have been working on and perfecting the
robotics approach for many years

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,800
more recently engineering teams have
begun to use deep learning as a

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,340
different approach for developing
autonomous vehicles deep neural networks

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,210
allow self-driving cars to learn how to
drive by mimicking human driving

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,200
behavior both the robotics and deep
learning methods are actively being

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,670
pursued today in the development of
self-driving cars so in this nanodegree

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,190
program you'll be working with both
approaches that way you as an engineer

12
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,480
will be prepared to work anywhere by the
end of this program will be teaming up

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,390
with other students to actually write
both robotics and deep learning code to

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,600
control a real self driving car pretty
cool along the way you work through

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,199
several modules with each one focusing
on a different layer of the self-driving

16
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,830
car technology stack and after each
module you'll build a project to

17
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,400
demonstrate what you've learned and
you'll get real human feedback on your

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,580
work this first module that you're going
through now is smaller and should only

19
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,490
take a week or so to complete later
modules will be longer and may take up

20
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,570
to a month in addition to receiving
human feedback on your project you'll

21
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,470
also have access to the forums where you
can ask questions and get to know your

22
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,570
fellow students and of course our team
is here to help you succeed so be sure

23
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,860
to reach out and keep in touch
