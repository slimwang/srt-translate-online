1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,000
We've talked a lot about variables, and

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,510
we want to make sure you really
feel comfortable with them.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,240
&gt;&gt; Right, understanding types and
variables is critical.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,720
So let's have that little quiz of yours.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,010
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do it.

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,120
&gt;&gt; Which of the following
are valid types?

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,720
&gt;&gt; And here's a small hint.

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,790
You can actually define
your own variable types.

9
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,380
So keep that in mind
going into this quiz.
