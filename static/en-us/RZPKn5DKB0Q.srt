1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,251
Now, the answer is no. Within the population of everyone who took the BBC test,

2
00:00:05,365 --> 00:00:10,731
you guys are a sample. There are a lot of different samples we could take of all

3
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:16,109
the people that took the test. We can take big samples, and small samples. And,

4
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:21,002
while your sample could get the same averages as those from the entire

5
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:26,553
population. There will also be samples that don't have the same averages. The

6
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:31,935
average memory score of the population is called the population parameter and

7
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:37,211
it's denoted by mu. It's a funny little Greek symbol. And the average for the

8
00:00:37,223 --> 00:00:42,429
sample is called a sample statistic and we generally denote it by x bar. An x

9
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:47,380
with a bar on top. Now, I want to stress, please don't be nervous about symbols.

10
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,160
I know a lot of people get pretty nervous when they see symbols that they

11
00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:57,328
haven't seen before. But in mathematics, we really need symbols to illustrate

12
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,571
our points. Think of it like, when you're playing a musical instrument, and you

13
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,310
have sheep Sheet music.

14
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:09,300
How else are we going to make sure that people in future generations learn these

15
00:01:09,312 --> 00:01:14,160
classical melodies? Sheet music is the best way to do that. And same with, in

16
00:01:14,172 --> 00:01:19,085
mathematics when we use symbols. We need to be able to articulate are thoughts

17
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:24,010
to other people all around the world. And that's one things that's really cool

18
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:29,421
about mathematics it's a universal language. So don't worry, you'll soon become

19
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:34,457
familiar with these symbols because we're going to use them throughout this

20
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:39,444
course. Now we can use this sample statistic to approximate the population

21
00:01:39,456 --> 00:01:44,925
parameter. But generally, they won't be exactly the same. The difference between

22
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:50,261
these two is called the sampling error. Which means we can make educates guesses

23
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:55,519
about population parameters using sample statistics, but we probably won't be

24
00:01:55,531 --> 00:02:00,704
100% accurate. That's why it's really important to have a good sample that can

25
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:05,914
better predict the population parameter. So going back the quiz, no. We don't

26
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:11,014
think that the average scores for this class will be exactly the same. But it

27
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:13,673
will probably come close, and we're going to be able to see that later.
