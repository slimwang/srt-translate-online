00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,764
Let's start by considering just these first two terms, x squared plus 6x, and we

2
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:09,084
want to complete the square with these 2 terms as the first 2 terms of that

3
00:00:09,084 --> 00:00:13,716
squared polynomial. Then the constant we need to add at the end is 9, since 6

4
00:00:13,716 --> 00:00:17,525
over 2 is 3 and 3 squared is 9. However, if we want to add 9 inside here,

5
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:21,490
without actually adding anything total to either side of the quation, then we

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,382
need to talso subtract 9 from somewhere on the right side. So that's exactly

7
00:00:25,382 --> 00:00:29,186
what I did. I wrote plus 9 inside the parenthesis, and then a minus 9 next to

8
00:00:29,186 --> 00:00:32,962
the plus 3 outside. Remember that because all of these terms are just added

9
00:00:32,962 --> 00:00:37,424
together, these parenthesis here are really just for notation. They're just to

10
00:00:37,424 --> 00:00:42,270
help me visualize that these terms belong together. This doesn't, in any way,

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,221
change the way these terms are combined. The factored form of x squared plus 6x

12
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:51,553
plus 9 is x plus 3 squared, and negative 9 plus 3 is just minus 6. So the

13
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:56,037
completed square form of y equals x squared plus 6x plus 3 is y equals the

14
00:00:56,037 --> 00:00:58,253
quantity x plus 3 squared minus 6.
