We just learned that the square root of some number n can be written in exponent

2
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:10,585
form as n to the 1 half power. That's great, that's super useful. What if

3
00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:15,705
instead though, I have something y to the 5th, and I want to do something to

4
00:00:15,717 --> 00:00:21,749
this using exponents that I end up with just y by itself, what exponent belongs

5
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:22,652
in this box?
