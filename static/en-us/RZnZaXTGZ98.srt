What did you get David?

this is a little bit more complicated.

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,260
We know that from our earlier
formula if a implies b,

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,800
then to rewrite it with implicational
elimination we write, not a or b.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,690
So or b is pretty straightforward,
or bird.

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,400
We take the not of
the conjunction over here and

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,270
say not has wings and not has fur.

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,180
Now some of you may have jumped
straight to writing this in full

9
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,670
conjunctive normal form, but now we're
going to move on and do that last step.
