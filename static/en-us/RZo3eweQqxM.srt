00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,460
The correct answer here is viewDidLoad.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,280
viewDidLoad is first called when your ID
controller is first loaded into memory,

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,870
even before it's shown on screen.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,480
viewWillAppear is only called when
a view controller is about to be

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,510
presented on screen, but
before it is actually on screen.
