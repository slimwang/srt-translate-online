00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,530
There's some variety in the way
that terminal programs look,

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,790
but the actual contents of
the terminal don't change much.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,980
It typically shows
informational messages,

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,870
output from previously run commands,
and a prompt for entering new commands.

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,570
Command prompts can be configured
differently on different systems, but

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,970
it's common for prompts to include
the login user's name, the host name, or

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,220
name of the computer you're logged into,
and maybe some other information too,

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,760
like the current time or
what folder the user is in.

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,850
You can enter new commands
after the prompt, and

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,180
after hitting enter your command runs
and the output is printed to the screen.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,750
After the output is printed,
a fresh prompt is added at the bottom of

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,210
the terminal, ready for
your next command.

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,350
In this quiz, see if you can identify
the parts of the terminal interface.

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,730
Label the interface
elements of this terminal.

15
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,788
The items to label are a shell command,
that command's output,

16
00:00:46,788 --> 00:00:53,170
a current prompt, a previously used
prompt, the cursor, and a login message.

17
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,460
Enter the number that corresponds
to each label in the text box.
