1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,420
In lesson one we introduced the
disconnect between what is required to

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:09,430
successfully manage the chronic diseases
that drive most health care costs, and

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,370
the structure of the US
healthcare system.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,120
We also suggested that health
IT could be a key tool, for

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,440
restructuring healthcare to
help address these issues.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,860
We'll review that in this lesson before
turning to the new US federal policies

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,580
to encourage adoption of health
information technology, and

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,340
new models of patient centered care.
