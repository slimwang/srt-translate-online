00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,871
So even though something like the square root of 2 can't be simplified, some

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:08,960
other square roots can. So let's figure out if we can simplify roots and how to

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,896
do that. We'll start with this one. We're going to use the product rule to help

4
00:00:13,896 --> 00:00:18,239
us simplify this radical. The product rule allows us to breakup a radical into

5
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,492
the multiplication of two separate radicals. So when we have two factors

6
00:00:22,492 --> 00:00:26,800
multiply together underneath the radical. We can take the square root of each

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,344
of them and multiply that result together. For example for the square root of

8
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:35,550
100, we know this is really just 10. But we can find this answer another way.

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,125
We know 100 is the same thing as 4 times 25. So we can break up this radical

10
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:44,315
and take the square root of each of the factors. The square root of 4 is 2, and

11
00:00:44,315 --> 00:00:47,560
the square root of 25 is 5, which leaves us with 2 times 5, which is 10, our

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,547
original answer. And these were perfect squares, so we were able to take out a

13
00:00:52,547 --> 00:00:57,202
factor in each case, the 2 and the 5. You'll notice that 75 is not a perfect

14
00:00:57,202 --> 00:01:02,134
square, but there is a perfect square as one of its factors. Use the product

15
00:01:02,134 --> 00:01:05,110
rule to break this up into 2 radicals, and then take the square root of one of

16
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:10,240
them. Leave any numbers that are not perfect squares, underneath the radical.

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,743
When you're ready, write your answer here.
