00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,400
So for my diagram project, I decided to look at

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,689
the mobile version of reddit.com. And I started by opening

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:09,420
up the HTML. This is a cleaned up version. Everything

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,470
starts by requesting the HTML. When we receive, we immediately start

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,620
building and parsing the DOM. In the head of the

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,230
file, we find this CSS file, compact.css. So we fire off

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,270
a request for it and continue parsing the DOM. In

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,460
the next line down we find this script for Google Analytics

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,750
but it's marked async so it's not part of

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,530
the critical rendering path and we can ignore it

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,500
for this exercise. Here we've requesting jQuery, so we

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,690
fire off the request and block the parser. At this

13
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,250
point the preload scanner kicks in, which looks down

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,869
the HTML for other resources it can start downloading. It

15
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:46,900
finds reddit-init.js in the header, and it finds another

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,660
script, mobile.js in the body and immediately starts their downloads.

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,530
When the CSS arrives, we build the CSSOM,

18
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,930
which unblocks jQuery.js and reddit-init.js, which gets run right

19
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,530
here. Then, we continue building the DOM. We'll

20
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,620
then render the last job script file, mobile.js which

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,020
we can actually find down inside the body

22
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,350
of the script down here, which finally lets us

23
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,600
render the page. Looking at the metrics of

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,177
the page, this leaves us with five critical resources:

25
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:21,890
the HTML, the CSS file, and the three Java script files. To find the number

26
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,050
of critical bytes, we just need to add up the sizes of all of our

27
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,760
critical resources. Which gives us 99.6 kilobites.

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,300
And in the best case scenario, it's going to

29
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,260
take five round trips to collect all the files that we need for the site.
