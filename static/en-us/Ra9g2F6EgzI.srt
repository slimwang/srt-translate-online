1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,210
And there again several possible solutions here, but the maximum number of items that Carol can select

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,130
is at most 3 and I'll give you one example of this.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:18,060
For example, she could decide to invest in the manufacturer,

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,310
which means that she cannot invest in this mining company here.

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:29,270
Then she could maybe decide to also invest in this bank, which means she cannot invest

6
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,940
in this mining company here, and then she could also choose one of those methods here.

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,630
Let's say she also decides that she is going to invest in silver,

8
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,750
but that means that copper and gold are out of the question.

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,170
Again, she could have also chosen one of the other possibilities here,

10
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,850
but three is really the maximum number of items that she can select.

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,210
Similar to the problem that Bob was working on, this is of course a bit of a simplification,

12
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,900
so when you're working on real work finance problems, you usually have constraints

13
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,730
that are a bit more complicate and also of course, your networks will be much larger,

14
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,570
but in essence that's a sort of problem that you might encounter in

15
00:01:10,570 --> 99:59:59,999
financial modeling and optimization--only a simplified version of it.
