00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,737
Now let's look at the process of how light is converted to data.

2
00:00:02,737 --> 00:00:06,885
And look at the digital process in parallel to what we just looked at

3
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:09,710
which was the process for doing it for films.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,821
The foundational device, foundational technology if you will, for

5
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:20,460
converting light to data is a CCD, right, Charge-Coupled Device.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,090
It's an electronic device that basically converts electrical charges into

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,700
a digital value.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,756
So in essence, a pixel on a output that comes out from

9
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:36,604
the charge coupled device, or a CCD, is basically, are different capacitors.

10
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:41,575
Which can work and store incoming photons as electron charges.

11
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:45,400
Photons are the ones that basically have photoelectric value.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,300
And once they have these capacitors these are converted into electron charges.

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,170
And it's this electron charge which is stored and given a digital value.

14
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,228
It's important to note here that Dr. Boyle and Dr. Smith in 1969.

15
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:06,103
While they were working at Bell Labs invented the concept of a CCD,

16
00:01:06,103 --> 00:01:08,202
a Charge-Coupled Device.

17
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:12,730
And of course, they were awarded with the Nobel prize in 2009.

18
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,929
And actually you know, being person who works in the photography field this was

19
00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:20,014
an amazing piece of technology that they have developed.

20
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:24,912
From 1969 to 2009 and of course it's one of the most common pieces of

21
00:01:24,912 --> 00:01:27,588
technology in our homes, our businesses.

22
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,896
And everybody has one nowadays is basically a camera that is

23
00:01:30,896 --> 00:01:34,750
somehow the other related to this concept of charge coupled device.
