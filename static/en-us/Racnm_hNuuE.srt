00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,400
Trojan Horses get their name from
a tale from the Trojan Wars.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,160
It is said that the Greeks wanted to
enter the well fortified city of Troy.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,550
Rather than launching a direct assault
at the city and suffering huge losses,

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,700
they devised a wooden horse and they
hid their soldiers inside the horse.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,610
Then the left the horse out side
the gates of Troy as a gift.

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,050
The Trojans thought the horse
as a gift to acknowledge that

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,200
the Greeks had been defeated.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,500
And so they brought the horse
into the city of Troy.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,340
At night, the Greek soldiers
hidden in the horse came out.

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,280
And they let their fellow
soldiers waiting outside the city

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,860
come in as well.

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,230
As a result, the Greek soldiers
passed all of Troy's defenses, and

13
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,800
destroyed the city, and won the war.

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,290
In the context of malware,
a Trojan horse is a piece

15
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,780
malicious code embedded in a utility
program that a user will run frequently.

16
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,540
That is, when a user runs this
useful program, the malicious code,

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,270
or the Trojan horse is also executing.

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,250
An example of a Trojan Horse is a login
program that performs key logging

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,772
meaning stealing user login and
password and

20
00:01:09,772 --> 00:01:14,040
pass along such confidential
information to an internet server.

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,110
The login program will still allow the
user to log in by calling the real login

22
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,290
subroutine because otherwise
the user would notice.

23
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,960
Many malicious browser extensions or
also perform key logging and

24
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,940
phishing, in addition to
some useful functions and

25
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,380
these are the latest
examples of Trojan Horses.
