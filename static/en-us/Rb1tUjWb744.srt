1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,740
Now the next thing we have to do, is to put these two steps within a loop, so

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,750
our program can prompt the user to take a

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,980
break multiple times during the day. So your challenge

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,950
is to add a loop to this code, so it prompts the user to take 3 breaks. Now

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,900
if you are confused about this task, there are

00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,880
some helpful links on loops in the instructor notes.
