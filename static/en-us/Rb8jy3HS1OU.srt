00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,490
If you remember in our last slide, one of the choices was whether you were using

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,120
physical or virtual distribution channels.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,020
Let's take a look at virtual channels, which are not only the web but also might include

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,680
iPhone apps or the Cloud as well.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,750
The first choice might be dedicated e-commerce.

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:23,310
That is you might have a website that belongs to you and that is one choice.

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,930
Another choice is that you might have an app that runs on a mobile device,

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:34,250
and mobile devices like Android or Apple and others and Microsoft require you to use

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,000
their platform app store and so that might be a choice.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,810
Another choice is to use two-step distribution that is there might be other distributors

11
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:50,510
who have major web presences like Amazon, Wal-Mart, other local and regional stores.

12
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:56,000
And you might actually sell your virtual products through theirs or physical products.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,500
You might use an aggregator. An aggregator is somebody who takes a vertical market approach.

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,660
Insurance, shoes, etc. Some examples are, for insurance, Lending Tree or Zappos.

15
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,110
Another might be social commerce.

16
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,510
Social commerce sites for distribution might include Facebook, Twitter, etc.

17
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,580
Zynga, which is a video game company, uses predominantly Facebook as its platform.

18
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,390
And then finally flash sales.

19
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,550
Examples include Groupon and Living Social.

20
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:34,080
Now, the first instinct of almost any startup founder is when you understand all the choices for

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,390
distribution channels is to say yes.

22
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:43,980
And the question is, yes to what? You can't afford to pick multiple channels on day one.

23
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:51,210
Most successful startups pick one of these and then may eventually expand into others.

24
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,490
So the question for you is what's going to be your first distribution channel

25
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,160
on the web, Cloud, or for mobile devices?
