1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,190
So when your users access your web apps
they don't type in your IP address.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:11,010
They put in a name like www.example.net,
a web address with a hostname in it.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,250
The way that your hostname gets
translated into an IP address

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,450
is through the Domain Name System,
or DNS.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,110
DNS is a worldwide distributed
directory of network information.

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,070
It stores a wide variety of records but

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,990
the best known kind of DNS
record is the A record.

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:32,830
A for address, which maps a name like
www.example.net to an IPv4 address.

9
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,570
Client programs such as web browsers
look up these records in order to find

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,240
the address of a web site or
another service.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,060
As the creator of a website you
need to set up DNS records for

12
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,780
it so that users can access it by name.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,090
Usually that will involve registering
the domain with a registrar and

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,700
pointing the DNS records at
the web servers IP addresses so

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,930
that users will be able to reach them.

16
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,400
A little later in this lesson you'll
have a chance to do exactly that.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,080
A DNS turns out to be really
important for websites.

18
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,780
If your DNS goes down, your site
can't be reached by most users.

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,720
A number of big sites
including Google and

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,760
Microsoft have had embarrassing outages
caused by their DNS records expiring.

21
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,230
DNS domains are also used as part
of the security mechanisms for

22
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,290
HTTP, including SSL encryption and
cookie privacy.

23
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,600
The DNS client code which
is called the resolver,

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,730
is built into every operating system.

25
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,350
Programs such as NC or ping, or
web browsers can just use it.

26
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,880
To test out DNS,

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,090
we'll use a couple of handy shell
utilities called Host and Dig.
