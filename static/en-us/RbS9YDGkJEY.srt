00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's start with the first expression. This one over here doesn't depend on sigma at all.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hence, the derivative 0. The derivative of logσ is 1/σ.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And this expression is funky because you have a σ⁻² in the denominator.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That results to 1/σ³ and then -2 multiplied in cancels the minus 1/2 over here

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
very conveniently to with we have all these sigmas in the denominator.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We multiply up σ³ which gives σ² over here and leaves only this expression on the right side.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Taking out σ² to the left side, we observe that we have Nσ² in the sum.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We get Nσ² and bringing N to the right gives us σ.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is the full proof that the empirical observed variance over the data

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
is the maximum likelihood estimator for finding the parameters of a Gaussian.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If you got this far, I am impressed.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We left basic statistics way behind us and got into fairly heavy math.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Thanks for taking this unit. If you just clicked forward and hit the next button, never mind.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You can complete the do you understand basic statistics

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
without understanding how it's being derived

16
00:01:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's move on and use the Gaussian for something practical.
