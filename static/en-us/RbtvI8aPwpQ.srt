00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,320
The polynomial reducability of one
problem to another is a relation,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,180
much like the at most relation that
you've seen since elementary school.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,390
And while it doesn't have
all the same properties,

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,510
it does have the important
property of transitivity.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,080
Like the traditional at most sign for
integers or real numbers,

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,580
the polynomial reducability sign is
transitive, meaning that if A is

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:27,130
reducable to B and B is reducible to C,
then A is reducible to C.

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:32,460
For example, we've seen how independent
set is reducible to vertex cover, and

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,380
I claim that vertex cover is reducible
to Hamiltonian path, a problem closely

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,160
related to the traveling salesman
problem, and from these facts,

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,580
it follows that independent set
is reducible to Hamiltonian path.

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,020
Let's take a look at
the proof of this theorem.

13
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,860
We'll let M be the program
that reduces A to B,

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,480
and we'll let N be the program
that reduces B to C.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,520
To turn an instance of the problem
A into an instance of the problem C

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,870
we just pass it through M and
then pass that result through N.

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,610
This whole process can be thought of
as another computable function, R.

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,500
Note that like M and N,
R is polynomial-time.

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,160
Thus x is in A if, and
only if, M of x is in B.

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,330
Remember, M implements that reduction.

21
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,180
And m of x is in B if and

22
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:29,390
only if N of M of x is in C because
N implements that reduction.

23
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,170
The composition of N and
M is the reduction R so

24
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,870
overall we have the x is in A if and
only if R is in C, just as we want.
