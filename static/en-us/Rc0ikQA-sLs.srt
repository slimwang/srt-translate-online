Now that we know that Grant's airplane map contains a right triangle, let's

2
00:00:04,205 --> 00:00:08,483
think more about right triangles in general. I've done three different right

3
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:12,848
triangles for you right here. And below each one, I've written one equation or

4
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:17,274
in these two cases two equations that relate the lengths of their sides to each

5
00:00:17,286 --> 00:00:21,628
other. For each triangle, I've labeled a as the shortest side, b as the second

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,945
shortest side, and c as the longest side link. Which equation or set of

7
00:00:25,957 --> 00:00:30,213
equations down here will hold true for all right triangles?
