00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,640
Here are the three properties again that we've been discussing, the Product

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,380
Property, the Quotient Property, and the Power Property. Many logarithmic

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,140
expressions can be rewritten or expanded or condensed using these properties.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,314
First, let's think about what it means to expand a logarithmic expression. That

5
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:20,442
basically means that we're going to break down something that looks complicated

6
00:00:20,442 --> 00:00:25,172
into smaller pieces. This logarithmic equation is a great one to work with for

7
00:00:25,172 --> 00:00:31,644
doing this. We have log base 3 of 6x squared y cubed. Let's break it down, we

8
00:00:31,644 --> 00:00:36,204
can expand this to log base 3 of 6 plus log base 3 of x squared plus log base 3

9
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:41,956
of y cubed. Which property that you've learned about allowed us to do this

10
00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:45,994
expansion? Was it the product property, the log of the product is equal to the

11
00:00:45,994 --> 00:00:51,522
sum of the logs? Was it the quotient property, the log of the quotient is equal

12
00:00:51,522 --> 00:00:56,832
to the difference of logs? Or was it the power property, the log of something

13
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:01,880
raised to a power is equal to the power times just the log?
