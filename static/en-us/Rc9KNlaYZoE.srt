Graph C and B are pretty easy to identify, since they're just linear equations.

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:10,494
So, they go with h of x and k of x. A and D are the two absolute value

3
00:00:10,494 --> 00:00:14,810
functions, so they are the functions f and g. We can figure out which one is

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:20,302
which by plugging in a few numbers. Let's say, x equals 0, for example. For f

5
00:00:20,302 --> 00:00:24,450
of x that gives us f of 0 equals the absolute value of negative 3 or a 3, which

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,750
is what we see in graph D. The same thing with g gives us g of 0 equals

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,870
negative 3, which is going with graph A.
