1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,110
So that's a little
background out of the way.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,180
Now you can probably see where
I'm heading with all this.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,970
Someone who can't see the screen,

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,010
can't access the visual
information in the interface.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,280
And someone who is using voice control
relies on the voice control software

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,710
being able to interact
with the web page.

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,680
So we need to make sure that
information is expressed in a way which

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,310
is flexible enough to be accessed
programatically by assistive technology.

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,320
Which can then create an alternative
user interface to suit its users needs.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,330
We refer to this as expressing
the semantics of an element.

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,500
The Web AIM checklist explicitly calls
this outing guideline 4.1, saying name,

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,550
role, value, markup is used in a way
that facilitates accessibility.

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,730
Okay, that's kind of terse.

14
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,280
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
go into a bit more detail.

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,640
For all user interface
components the name and

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,900
role can be programmatically determined.

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,840
States, properties and

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,060
values that can be set by the user
can be programmatically set.

19
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,910
So what are name role and value?

20
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,280
And how can we make sure that they can
be programmatically determined and set?

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,670
To answer that, we're going to start off
by trying things out from the point of

22
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,580
view of someone using
assistive technology.

23
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,160
Just before we jump into that I want
to quickly mention that in this course

24
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,320
we will be working mostly
with screen readers.

25
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,880
But a lot of the work we do
to support screen readers

26
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,380
also benefits users who use
other assistive technologies.

27
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,610
Things like voice control and

28
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,280
switch control use the same
programmatically expressed semantics.

29
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,480
In the introduction we had a first
look at using a screen reader.

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,290
Now were going to try using
one without any access to

31
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,840
the web pages visible interface
