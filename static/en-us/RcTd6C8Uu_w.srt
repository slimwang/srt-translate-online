00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,560
Let's actually use the framework on a real website.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,560
Here's a mock up for a portfolio site that you can use.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,280
There's a link in the instructor notes.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,570
Think about what you learned last lesson about approaching the process of

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,810
going from design to an actual website.

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,740
But instead of creating new classes and styles from scratch,

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,490
you should use the classes that your new framework supports.

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,660
I've gone ahead and drawn some boxes around different elements in the mock up.

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,110
These boxes correspond with the rows and columns from the framework.

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,540
Which classes correspond with the boxes in the mock up?

11
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,509
Which class would you use for the red box at the top, the blue box at the top,

12
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,650
the red box at the bottom, and the blue box at the bottom?

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,650
