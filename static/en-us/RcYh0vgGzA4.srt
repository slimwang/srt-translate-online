1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,300
So we can look at two
different policies or

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,390
models that make sense for
commercial environments.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,861
We're going to start with orders
called the Clark-Wilson policy.

4
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:15,670
So Clark-Wilson policy says
that users should be able to

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,580
access certain programs or applications.

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,970
Objects are constrained and

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,180
certain objects can only be
accessed by certain programs.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,820
So the way you think
about the policy is that

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,340
somebody says this user should have
access to this application, and

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,710
somebody says this application
should have access to these objects,

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,990
so that's what the user can then
gain access to those objects.

12
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,340
And only when they're
running those applications.

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,970
So if I want separation-of-duty, for
example, where the same person should be

14
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,410
able to do things that could
potentially lead to fraud, then we

15
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,760
can just say that user Alice cannot
execute both of those applications.

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,790
So, you can do one and
somebody else will need to

17
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,540
be able to run the other application and
that's how we separate the two duties

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,710
associated with the two
applications that we have here.

19
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,910
So, Clark Wilson essentially was
developed for commercial settings.

20
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:17,270
The second one is more about
the conflict of interest requirement,

21
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,390
how we address that.

22
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,390
And the name of the policy is
called Chinese Wall Policy,

23
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,680
and we'll see why this is
an appropriate name for it.

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,680
So the deals, as we said,
with conflict of interest and

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,690
what you can access or cannot access
depends on what you have seen so far.

26
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,150
So what you've seen so far,

27
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,360
if it has no conflict with the next
thing you're asking for then it's okay.

28
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,910
If not, then we're going to deny access.

29
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,920
So how do we decide when
do you have a conflict or

30
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,220
the absence of that
conflict of interest?

31
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,090
To explain this conflict of interest and
the Chinese Wall Policy a little bit

32
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,000
more, let's say we have
a document on a system.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,445
Now some documents
are financial documents

34
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:03,755
that pretend to different banks.

35
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:06,745
So Chase, Wells Fargo,
Bank of America, whatever it is.

36
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:10,875
So this grouping here, these are all the
documents that are for Bank of America.

37
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,380
These are all the documents for
Wells Fargo and so on.

38
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,920
Okay, similarly we have other
documents that pertain to, let's say,

39
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,770
oil companies.

40
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,460
So some documents are Exxon,
others Shell, Chevron, and so on.

41
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,660
The reason we have this outer box
around all the bank documents or

42
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,360
oil company documents is that
this is a conflict class.

43
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,560
Chase has a conflict with Wells Fargo
because they're in the same

44
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,590
kind of business so
they compete with each other.

45
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,220
So the conflict class is, you know,
these documents form the conflict.

46
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,710
Similarly, Exxon would have
a conflict with Shell and Chevron.

47
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,280
So these documents are in
this other conflict class.

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,970
Okay.
So Chinese Wall Policy

49
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,780
basically says a user can access
any object as long as he or she

50
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,460
has not accessed an object from another
company In the same conflict class.

51
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:05,060
So let's say user Alice accesses Exxon,
okay, a document pertaining to Exxon.

52
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,510
She can because so
far she has accessed nothing, so

53
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,350
there's no conflict that we can see.

54
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,560
As soon as she accesses a document
from this class, from Exxon.

55
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,740
She cannot access anything in these
other classes that are in the same

56
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,530
conflict class.

57
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,270
So she can't access something
that belongs to Shell or Chevron.

58
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,150
Can she then go and access
a document that pertains to Chase?

59
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,300
Yes, that's in a different
conflict class.

60
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,540
There's no conflict between Chase and
Exxon.

61
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,170
Alice can access this and this.

62
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,710
But as soon as she does Chase
she can't access Wells Fargo, so

63
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,110
you can basically access
any oil company and

64
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,790
any bank but not two oil companies and
not two banks at the same time.

65
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,310
So we're basically creating these
walls around sets of documents, okay.

66
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,330
That a conflict exists across those and

67
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,390
that's why it's called
a Chinese Wall Policy.
