1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,870
Thinking about it this way, some point p, in the middle there right.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,380
That's projective ray, is in that plane.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,430
And it's therefore, perpendicular to the original line.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,690
So, basically, you would just take the dot product between p and

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,400
l, and if that's zero, then that point p is on the line.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,490
So the answer is b,

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,690
I think, I think that's what I said before, isn't that right?

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,260
Isn't that right Megan, b?

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,460
>> Yes.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,060
>> Yes.

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,250
She's right, she's paying attention.
