00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,240
The introduction of Machine Learning
as an EMR technology is I think,

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,620
potentially a key development.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,170
If EMR's are to adapt to physicians,

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,330
they must have some
understanding of what they do.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,730
To explore that further,

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,640
we'll now turn to a second commercial
EMR, Praxis by Infor-Med Corporation.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,440
PRAXIS using machine learning and
each physician user trains it

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,460
as they see the common
problems in their practice.

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,720
Which it identifies based on the
physicians entry of the clinical finding

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,490
most specific for each problem.

11
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,090
Over time PRAXIS learned how that
physician usually treats each problem

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,080
and as shown here.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,460
Presents a note based on
the most similar past patients.

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,980
Each phrase is what Praxis
calls a clinical concept.

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,210
But these are not encoded into
SNOMED CT or any other data standard.

16
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,520
They are text descriptions as
defined by each physician.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,160
To avoid the erroneous default
value problem we discussed earlier.

18
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,830
The physician must click on each
clinical concept to confirm

19
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,400
and, or edited.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,530
This one has been clicked on and the
physician can then edit the number of

21
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,690
days to whatever is appropriate for
that patient.
