1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,890
Let's implement two more functions now.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,650
The first will compute the dot product
of two vectors and the second will

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:12,130
compute the angle between two vectors,
both in radians and in degrees.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,598
Use your code to answer
the following questions.

5
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:18,484
Remember that like with
the normalization function earlier,

6
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:21,047
if one of your vectors
is the zero vector,

7
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:24,066
there may be a special case
you have to deal with.

8
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,755
For the first question,

9
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:32,775
please find the dot product
of the vectors 7.887,

10
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:38,038
4.138, and -8.802, 6.776.

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:43,404
For the second question
please find the dot product

12
00:00:43,404 --> 00:00:48,894
of -5.955, -4.904, -1.874,

13
00:00:48,894 --> 00:00:54,277
and -4.496, -8.755, 7.103.

14
00:00:54,277 --> 00:00:59,220
For the third question,
please find the angle

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,038
in radians between the vectors 3.183,

16
00:01:04,038 --> 00:01:09,501
-7.627, and -2.668, 5.319.

17
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:14,755
And for the last question,
please find the angle

18
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:19,371
in degrees between the vectors 7.35,

19
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:22,833
0.221, 5.188, and

20
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:27,467
2.751, 8.259, 3.985.

21
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:31,547
As before, please enter your solutions
within an accuracy of at least three

22
00:01:31,547 --> 00:01:32,510
decimal places.
