00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
All right, next we have a bit of a trick question--I'm importing the regular expression library

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and then I'm calling "re.findall" on the regular expression [a-z] [a-z]+,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and the haystack string "a quick brown".

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And that's going to return a list, and in these blanks, I want you to write the elements of that list.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
One of the strings inside "a quick brown" that are matched by this regular expression.
