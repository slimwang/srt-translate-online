1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,280
Now that everyone has to write shorter
messages I'm going to ask again about

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:04,750
going to the movies.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,240
So far so good.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,490
I'm liking the app better already.

5
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,250
And if I ever decide that I want to
tweak the message length again,

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,810
I can easily return to
the Firebase console and

7
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,310
try out different message lengths
until I find one that works.

8
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,699
For now I'll wait a few days again and
then check analytics to see if my

9
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:24,960
changes will increase my number
of users or my user engagement.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,289
Now this was not a true AB test.

11
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:30,980
If you'd like learn more about to write
a proper AB test using remote config and

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,109
Firebase analytics, I've provided
a link below to get you started.
