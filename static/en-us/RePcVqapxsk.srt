00:00:00,546 --> 00:00:02,372
Let's take a look at our Jersey Square team

2
00:00:02,372 --> 00:00:04,260
and because they understand their archetype

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,669
is interested in both subscription and rental,

4
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:09,211
let's see what they were thinking.

5
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:11,456
And they said well, let's see one

6
00:00:11,456 --> 00:00:14,176
particular model could be an annual subscription,

7
00:00:14,176 --> 00:00:16,600
which is a strategy and here is the tactic

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,690
at a $199 per year and we could give them

9
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,986
authentic top of line jerseys and free shipping

10
00:00:23,986 --> 00:00:26,456
and send a jersey back and exchange for another.

11
00:00:26,456 --> 00:00:29,414
We could offer them either a yearly price

12
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:32,222
or we could offer a monthly price which

13
00:00:32,222 --> 00:00:34,263
would cost more but wouldn't commit them

14
00:00:34,263 --> 00:00:35,951
for such a longer period of time

15
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:38,077
but they would get the exact same features.

16
00:00:38,077 --> 00:00:39,754
They discovered there was another archetype,

17
00:00:39,754 --> 00:00:43,413
another customer segment that was casual users.

18
00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:45,779
And these people just wanted a one-time

19
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:49,918
use for a one-week rental for a particular game.

20
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:52,955
Well you get a top of line jersey and you get

21
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:55,765
shipping but the goal was you send the jersey

22
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:58,502
back within one week and we won't charge you

23
00:00:58,502 --> 00:01:00,925
for the jersey and that's a rental.

24
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:03,019
So they had three pricing models, they were

25
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:07,019
now going to a/b test for price elasticity.
