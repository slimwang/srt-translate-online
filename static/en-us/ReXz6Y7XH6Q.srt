1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,700
Next, we delve into the technologies
that power real word HIT systems.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,880
You've now heard of one of them,
data standards,

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,130
when we looked at ICD codes and
their role in the HR certification.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,750
You've also heard hints of
the importance of the other two,

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,070
technologies for assuring privacy,
security, and trust, and

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,290
for supporting health
information exchange.

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,560
We now begin a three lesson sequence
in which we'll cover these in

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,100
the reverse order to which
I've just introduce them,

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,180
beginning with health
information exchange.
