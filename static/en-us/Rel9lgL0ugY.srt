00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,940
Now that we have seen semantic networks in action, we can

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,910
ask ourselves the important question. What makes a knowledge representation,

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:12,560
a good representation? Well, a good knowledge representation makes relationships

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,184
explicit. So in the two by one matrix problem, there were all these objects,

5
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:22,630
circles and triangles and dots. There were there this relationship between them,

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,450
left off and inside. And the semantic that worked made all of them explicit.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,160
It exposed the natural constraints of the problem. A good representation

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,350
works at the right level of abstraction. So that it captures everything that

9
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,240
needs to be captured, and yet. Removes all the details that are not needed.

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,910
So representation, a good representation, is transparent, concise,

11
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,440
captures only what is needed, but complete, captures everything that is needed.

12
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,710
It is fast, because it doesn't have all the details that are not needed. And it

13
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:01,440
is computable. It allows you to draw from the inferences that need to be drawn,

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,736
in order to address the problem at hand.
