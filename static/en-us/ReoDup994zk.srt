00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,160
So I just noticed that the maximum
number of minutes spent by

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,960
any student during the first week is
actually greater than the number of

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,030
minutes in a week.

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,260
My process for debugging problems
like this is similar to my process

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,890
tracking down the missing
engagement records before.

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,400
I'd like you to follow
the same steps here.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,810
First, you'll need to decide which
data points count as surprising.

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,790
Then, print some of those out and
see if you can find anything wrong.

9
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,740
Were you able to find a problem?

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,780
Describe any problems you found here.

11
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,670
The bug is actually in some of
the starter code that I gave you.

12
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,840
So if you can't figure out exactly
what's causing any problems that you

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,840
find, don't feel bad.
