1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,770
Okay, so for our value proposition,

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,870
we're simply going to
fill in Moore's Template.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,850
Our first line is For.

4
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,520
We're thinking about our
target customers here.

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,790
So who is your market segment or
persona?

6
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,420
Then we have Who.

7
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,210
So our target customer is blank.

8
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,080
Now what is their main problem
that our company is solving for?

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,490
So this is where you write in
their problem or their need.

10
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,610
Our product or service is, blank.

11
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,660
Now this is where you describe
the product or the solution.

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,630
You want to categorize this generally.

13
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,880
Remember, this is not
the differentiation line.

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,420
Then we have that provides.

15
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,380
What is your primary
benefit to your customer?

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,530
What is your solution to their problem?

17
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,170
Cite your breakthrough capability here.

18
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,240
And the main benefit that
the customer receives.

19
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,510
Next we have unlike.

20
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,900
This is where you want to
reference your competition.

21
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,320
Now you're not trying to compare
a Michelin star restaurant to

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,420
a Subway here.

23
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,750
This is a real alternative
to your business.

24
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,050
And finally, our product or
solution, blank.

25
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,550
This is where you state your primary
differentiation with your competitor.

26
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,519
This is your key point of
competitive differentiation.

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,100
Not every way that you're different, and
some consider this last line optional.

28
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,720
So taken together, the template is for
your target customers, who,

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,800
what is their main problem, and
you state your product or services,

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,260
describe the solution or your product,
but don't differentiate.

31
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,030
And what is it that you provide for
your customer?

32
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,490
Unlike, who's your main competition?

33
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,950
And what is it that differentiates
you from that competition.

34
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,240
This is simple framework, but really
helps you clearly define your product

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,050
and where you fit
against the competitor.

36
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,770
Now, I want you to take the time
to fill this out yourself.

37
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,870
I want you to fill in the blanks to
complete your value proposition.

38
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,000
You can use your own app idea, or

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,400
you can try to fill it in
using the aBarkment idea.
