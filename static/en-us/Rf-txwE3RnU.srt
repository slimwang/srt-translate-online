1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,110
Well if we add 32 on the left side of the equation, then we need to subtract 32

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,255
from the same side. This should make a total of 0 on the left hand side of the

3
00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:16,548
equation. And we'd be left with 2x squared like here, minus 16x here, plus 33

4
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:22,920
here. This is why these two equations are exactly the same. The other way that

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,780
we can think about it is that if we add 32 on the right hand side of the

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:31,023
equation, then we add 32 on the left hand side of the equation. We could just

7
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:37,850
subtract the 32 to get the y alone, and we wind up with this equation. Since we

8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,134
want the equation to be in the form y equals, it's best to go ahead an subtract

9
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:48,220
32, from the same side that we add 32. We can just skip the step of adding 32

10
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,620
on both sides, so long as we subtract the 32, since we added 32 here.
