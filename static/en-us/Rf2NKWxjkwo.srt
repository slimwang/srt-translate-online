1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,900
The box model defines an HTML
element space on the screen and

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,660
you can visualize it with the dev tools.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,916
Hovering over an element shows
its entire box model and

4
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:12,401
by using the diagram
in the Styles panel.

5
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:16,200
You can highlight each component of
an element's box model individually.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,610
I mean, come on, you have to admit,
that's pretty cool.

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,570
Every box model is made
up of four components.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,960
The content, the padding, which is
the space between the content and

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,300
the border, the border and the margin.

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,800
Margin is the space between this
element and any neighboring elements.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,239
Most people think of margin as being
the space on the outside of elements.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,430
While everything from the border to the
content is on the inside of elements.

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,930
Now before we go any further,
I want to point out this chunk of CSS.

14
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,320
It changes the default way
the sizes of boxes are calculated,

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,320
the default version is content box and
it's a little weird.

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,991
Because most people
look at the box model.

17
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:04,170
And assume that the margin is
the space on the outside and

18
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,200
everything else is
the space on the inside.

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,540
It would make sense for the area on
the inside to represent the width and

20
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,502
the height of an element.

21
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:16,360
And for margin to not be
included in this measurement, but

22
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,840
that's not the case.

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,670
With content box, width and

24
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,950
height don't include padding or
border, that's what makes it weird.

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,619
For example, if you were to set
the width of an element to be 800px and

26
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,450
then add padding and border.

27
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,880
Then the actual width of the element
is 800px, plus whatever padding and

28
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,229
border is added to the element.

29
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,330
This is confusing, because the width
only includes the content.

30
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,179
It doesn't include the padding or border
which are parts of the box model that

31
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,340
most people think of
as inside the element.

32
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,671
This is often unexpected behavior, with
border-box you don't have this problem.

33
00:01:55,671 --> 00:02:01,110
Both padding and border are included
in the width and height of the element.

34
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,850
So you can be safe as thinking
of content, padding and

35
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,100
border as on the inside of the element
and as margin on the outside.

36
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,829
>From here on out when we're
describing the way box sizing works.

37
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,230
We'll assume that you're using
border-box, instead of content-box.

38
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,490
Anyway, there's a bit more to the box
model than what I've given you so

39
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,180
far, but this is more than
enough to be dangerous.
