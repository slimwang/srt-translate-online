1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,680
So, we know this trinomial can be factored like this. And now, we want to see if

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,615
we can continue factoring this inside trinomial. So, if we wanted to continue

3
00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:12,725
factoring, which number should we use in our number puzzle? One of these numbers

4
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:17,034
will be the top number, and then one of these will be the bottom number. Choose

5
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:18,653
one from each row.
