1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,280
So the right place to put the commit,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,660
is immediately after the execute
in this particular code.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,670
By adding commit, you can make
sure that your changes get saved.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,132
By the way,
one nice thing about transactions and

5
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:15,910
rollbacks, is that if your code crashes
in the middle of a database transaction,

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,370
you can be sure that it won't have
written half-finished changes.

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,710
This is an important database
principle called atomicity.

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,600
Atomicity means that either
a change happens as a whole,

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,390
atomically or it happens not at all.

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,690
On the next page,
we'll be switching gears a bit.

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,830
Remember that software I asked you
to install at the end of Lesson two?

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,000
I hope it hasn't had time to get dusty,
because you're going to use that next.
