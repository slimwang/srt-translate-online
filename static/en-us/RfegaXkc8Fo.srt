1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,370
Now some people like manipulating trees.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,161
And some people like a more sort
of formal mathematical notation.

3
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:09,989
So if you're one of those, I'm going to
give you another way to think about

4
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:11,826
whether or not we have a solution.

5
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:16,469
And let's start with the problem
solving where a plan consists of

6
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:19,149
a straight line sequence.

7
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:22,219
And we said, one way to decide if this

8
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:27,799
is a plan that satisfies the goal is
to say, is the end state a goal state?

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,550
If we want to be more formal and write
that out mathematically, what we can say

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:37,210
is, what this plan represents is
we started in the start state.

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:42,411
And then we transitioned to
the state that is result of

12
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:48,201
applying the action of going
from A to S to that start state.

13
00:00:48,201 --> 00:00:52,887
And then we apply it to that
the result of starting in that

14
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:58,286
intermediate state and applying
the action of going from S to F.

15
00:00:58,286 --> 00:01:03,085
And if that resulting state is
an element of the set of goals,

16
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:05,290
then this plan is valid.

17
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,720
This plan gives us a solution.

18
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:10,140
And so that's a mathematical
formulation of what it means for

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,680
this plan to be a goal.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,220
Now in stochastic,
partially observable worlds,

21
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:17,519
the equations are a little
bit more complicated.

22
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,530
Instead of just having s prime
as a result of applying some

23
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:26,213
action to the initial state,
we're dealing with belief states,

24
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,569
rather than individual states.

25
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:33,616
And what we say is our new belief
state is the result of updating

26
00:01:33,617 --> 00:01:37,984
what we get from predicting
what our action will do and

27
00:01:37,983 --> 00:01:43,469
then updating it based on our
observation, O, of the world.

28
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:47,353
So the prediction step is when
we start off in a belief state,

29
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:51,787
we look at the action, we look at
each possible result of the action.

30
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:56,015
Because they're so caustic, to each
possible member of the belief state,

31
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,402
and so
that gives us a larger belief state.

32
00:01:58,402 --> 00:02:02,804
And then we update that belief state by
taking account of the observation, and

33
00:02:02,804 --> 00:02:06,340
that will give us a smaller or
same size belief state.

34
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,949
And now that gives us the new state.

35
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,600
And we can use this predict and

36
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:14,129
update cycle to keep track of
where we are in belief state.
