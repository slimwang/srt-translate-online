1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,960
We want to take, an offline first approach to building

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,290
web apps, where your app can work offline by default.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,460
Don't be fooled, into thinking offline, can be an afterthought,

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,820
just because we left this lesson to the end. Offline support,

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,940
in the web platform, is a very complex topic, which

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,070
is why we saved to the last. But first, let's

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,810
define, what offline really means. There are a number of

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,500
different scenarios, that can cause someone to be offline. These typically

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,170
boil down, to not having a radio or Wi-Fi connection. But,

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,210
not all of these scenarios, can be detected, by making a connection

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,840
attempt. It's good to keep this in mind and all the

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,330
more reason, to build apps, that treat the network as an enhancement.
