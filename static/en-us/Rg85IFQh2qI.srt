1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,499
So the answer is whether or not, you can see methods that are defined in the

2
00:00:04,499 --> 00:00:08,895
superclass of DiscerningBear, which is GrizzlyBear. For sobj1 you can see

3
00:00:08,895 --> 00:00:14,020
attributes defined by GrizzlyBear. For sobj2, you can't, because you don't use

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,354
any attributes defined in this class. An easy way to see that is to look at

5
00:00:18,354 --> 00:00:22,648
knock<u>down</u>tree method, which is defined in the GrizzlyBear class. When we use

6
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:26,864
super passing into DiscerningBear, that method exists and it does what it should

7
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:30,929
do. Timber! What do we think, we'll get when we looked at for the knocked down

8
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,162
tree attribute for the sobj that results from calling in super passing in

9
00:00:34,162 --> 00:00:38,605
GrizzlyBear. Well that attribute does not exist because it's not defined by any

10
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,220
super class of grizzly bear
