All right,
welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,170
If you recall last time I said that,

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,410
that was going to end our,
recognition, discussion.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,130
When we talked about SVMs and
discriminative learning, well I lied.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,190
Basically what I'm going to talk about
is what's referred to as a bag of words

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,160
approach to doing recognition.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,070
And it, it was used somewhat in
static images, a lot in video but it,

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,800
it really should follow
right after doing the SVM.
