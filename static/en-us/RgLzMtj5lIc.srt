1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,780
Now consider a directed graph.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,340
I want you to number the vertices, and

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,700
then, fill in the entries
of its adjacency matrix.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,640
Do that by typing a 1 in
the appropriate entries.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,080
If you want, you can insert 0 entries,
where there are no edges.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,095
But if you're feeling lazy,
feel free to leave any entry blank, and

7
00:00:18,095 --> 00:00:19,904
we will interpret that as a 0.
