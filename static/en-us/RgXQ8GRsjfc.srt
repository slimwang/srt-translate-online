1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In Bayes rule, we have a hidden variable we care about--whether they have cancer or not.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
But we can't measure it directly and instead we have a test.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We have a prior of how frequent this variable is true and the test is generally characterized

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
by how often it says positive when the variable is true

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and how often it is negative and the variable is false.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Bayes rule takes a prior, multiplies in the measurement,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which in this case we assume to be the positive measurement to give us a new variable

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and does the same for all actual measurement, given the opposite assumption about

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
our hidden variable of cancer and that multiplication gives us this guy over here.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We add those two things up and then it gives us a new variable and then

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
we divide these guys to arrive the best estimate of the hidden variable c given our test result.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And this example, I used the positive example is a test result

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
but it might do the same with a negative example.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This was exactly the same as in our diagram in the beginning.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There was a prior of our case, we have this specific variable to be true.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We noticed inside this prior, it can cover the region for which our test result applies.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We noticed that test result also apply when the condition is not fulfilled.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, this expression over here and this expression over here corresponds exactly

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
to the red area over here and the green area over here.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But then we noticed that these two areas don't add up to 1.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The reason is that's lots of stuff outside, so we calculated the total area

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
which was this expression over here, pPos.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And then we normalized these two things over here by the total area to get the relative area

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
that is assigned the red thing versus the green thing and at this time by just dividing by the total area

25
00:01:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in this region over here; thereby, getting rid of any of the other cases.
