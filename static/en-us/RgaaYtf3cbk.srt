1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,360
Meaningful use is a very important,
highly visible and

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,560
even controversial at times program,

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,820
that's divided into the three stages
that phase in over a period of years.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,620
Stage 1 is about data capture and
sharing.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,880
Things like electronically capturing
health information in the standardized

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,350
format, specified by the EHR
certification program.

7
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,729
Stage 2 is about more advanced
clinical processes, but

8
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:38,730
is similar to Stage 1, just more
ambitious and more sophisticated.

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,430
For example, the increased
requirements for E-Prescribing, and

10
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,000
incorporating laboratory tests.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,780
We'll look at that in a moment.

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,385
Stage 3 aims for improved clinical
outcomes, which depends on more advanced

13
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:57,360
EMR functionality, such as clinical
decision support to guide providers.

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,440
And tools to help patients become
more involved in their own care.

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,970
Stage 3 is ambitious, and has recently
been pushed out to at least 2017.

16
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,960
Today, a majority of providers
participating in meaningful

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,140
use have achieved stage 1, and
are now focused on stage 2,

18
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,531
but only a small percentage
have achieved stage 2, to date.
