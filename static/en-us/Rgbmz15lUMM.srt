00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,104
So now we have this awesome new form for the equation of a parabola, y minus k

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:08,090
equals a times x minus h squared. What I want to know is what we should call

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,134
this form. I keep having to read it out each time I say it. And, as you know,

4
00:00:12,134 --> 00:00:16,261
I'm really lazy and I don't want to do that. I just want to have a name for it.

5
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:20,934
So what should we call it? Should we call this the x-intercept form for the

6
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:26,796
equation of a parabola? The y-intercept form? Vertex form? Minimum form? Or

7
00:00:26,796 --> 00:00:28,055
maximum form?
