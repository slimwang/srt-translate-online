00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,936
I know that we have seen that there are two zeroes in this part of the graph,

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:07,445
but let's just pick one of them to focus us on. How about the right most one?

3
00:00:07,445 --> 00:00:11,226
Which we knows in the interval 1 to 2. Now that we have chosen us here to focus

4
00:00:11,226 --> 00:00:14,234
us on, we want to start narrowing down the interval that we knows the zero lies

5
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:18,700
between. In other words, we are going to start zooming in on this portion of

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,813
the graph. To do this, I'd like you to first pick a value of x that lies

7
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:26,829
between that interval, between 1 and 2. Type that here. And then, plug that

8
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:31,626
value of x into the function and write what f of x at your value is equal to.

9
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:37,152
Now, remembering that the function is negative when x equals 1. But it's

10
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:41,240
positive when x equals 2. Narrow down the interval in x in which the zero must

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,588
lie. So, the value of your function is negative, then the new interval will be

12
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:50,521
your x value and 2. But if the function is positive at your x value, then the

13
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:55,522
new interval will be between one and your value. Take a little time and think

14
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:56,993
carefully about this.
