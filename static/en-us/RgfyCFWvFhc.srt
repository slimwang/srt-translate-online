1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,850
Now it's your turn to put
these operations into code.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,350
I'd like you to please implement
the addition, subtraction and

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,230
scalar multiplication functions
in a language of your choice.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,290
Use your code to find the answers
to the following questions.

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,201
After the quiz, I will show you
the solution I used based on the python

6
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:20,708
module I introduced
earlier in the lesson.

7
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:25,114
For the first question please compute

8
00:00:25,114 --> 00:00:30,346
the vector 8.218 minus 9.341 plus

9
00:00:30,346 --> 00:00:35,588
the vector minus 1.1229 2.111.

10
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:42,567
For the second question,
please compute the vector 7.119,

11
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:49,055
8.215 minus the vector, -8.223, 0.878.

12
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:56,384
For the third question
please compute the scalar

13
00:00:56,384 --> 00:01:02,600
7.41 times the vector,
1.671, -1.012, -0.318.

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,898
Please enter your solutions
within an accuracy of at least

15
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:08,660
three decimal places.
