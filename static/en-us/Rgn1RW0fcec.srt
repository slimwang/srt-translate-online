00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Norvig] Now let's move on to stochastic environments.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's consider a robot that has slippery wheels

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
so that sometimes when you make a movement--a left or a right action--

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the wheels slip and you stay in the same location.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And sometimes they work and you arrive where you expected to go.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And let's assume that the suck action always works perfectly.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We get a belief state space that looks something like this.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Notice that the results of actions will often result in a belief state

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that's larger than it was before--that is, the action will increase uncertainty

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
because we don't know what the result of the action is going to be.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And so here for each of the individual world states belonging to a belief state,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
we have multiple outcomes for the action, and that's what stochastic means.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And so we end up with a larger belief state here.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But in terms of the observation, the same thing holds as in the deterministic world.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The observation partitions the belief state into smaller belief states.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So in a stochastic partially observable environment,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
the actions tend to increase uncertainty,

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and the observations tend to bring that uncertainty back down.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now, how would we do planning in this type of environment?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I haven't told you yet, so you won't know the answer for sure,

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
but I want you to try to figure it out anyways, even if you might get the answer wrong.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Imagine I had the whole belief state from which I've diagrammed just a little bit here

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and I wanted to know how to get from this belief state

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
to one in which all squares are clean.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So I'm going to give you some possible plans,

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and I want you to tell me whether you think each of these plans will always work

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
or maybe sometimes work depending on how the stochasticity works out.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Here are the possible plans.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Remember I'm starting here, and I want to know how to get to a belief state

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
in which all the squares are clean.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
One possibility is suck right and suck, one is right suck left suck,

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
one is suck right right suck,

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and the other is suck right suck right suck.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So some of these actions might take you out of this little belief state here,

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
but just use what you knew from the previous definition of the state space

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and the results of each of those actions

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and the fact that the right and left actions are nondeterministic

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and tell me which of these you think will always achieve the goal

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
or will maybe achieve the goal.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And then I want you to also answer for the fill-in-the-blank plan--

41
00:02:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that is, is there some plan, some ideal plan, which always or maybe achieves the goal?
