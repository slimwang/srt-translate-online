00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,120
It's really important to use analytics
with monetization because you really

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,560
want to understand your users.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,750
So as an app developer, knowing
more information about your users

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,100
will allow you to tailor it and
change things and tweak things so

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,460
that you can try to figure out, okay,
why did someone stop at this level?

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,330
Maybe it was too hard for them, or maybe
you have to offer an in app purchase, or

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,350
something like that.

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,940
That allows them to really understand
how to get to the next piece of

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,650
monetization.

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,320
Right?

11
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,610
So the more data that you have
the more it helps you understand, okay

12
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,300
what do I have to do to tweak my app to
get to the next phase of your business.
