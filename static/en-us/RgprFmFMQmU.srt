1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,180
These points are called vanishing points.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,870
Here's it demonstrated that each set of parallel lines,

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,460
that means they're all in the same direction, meet at the different point.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,900
Another thing that's true is that parallel lines that are all on the same plane,

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,540
they all converge to colinear Vanishing points.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,630
And you know this as the horizon.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,780
So here is one set of parallel lines in the world.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,820
And they converge to a point here.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,630
This is another set of parallel lines.

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,520
And they converge to a point there.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,720
If I had parallel lines going away from the camera,

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,320
they would converge like this, all right?

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,080
And the horizon is this line right there.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,810
And that's because all of those parallel lines that I drew, they were all

15
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,360
in ground plane, so they all converge at vanishing points on the horizon.

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,290
By the way it turns out

17
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,260
getting the vanishing points consistent, when you're putting together an image.

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,970
Like, you're taking a piece of a building here, and

19
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,540
putting something else together there,

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,520
as opposed to actually taking a picture, is actually kind of hard.

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,150
So if you want to try to find a fake image.

22
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,560
That is, something that's been Photoshopped, put together.

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,620
Go to your local supermarket tabloid.

24
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,780
You can often find pictures where the vanishing points don't seem to

25
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,110
do the right thing, and

26
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,780
that's because it was made up of parts of an image that weren't taken with

27
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,860
a camera aligned with those parallel lines all in the same way.

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,090
A little bit more, maybe some of you actually took an art class,

29
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,360
before you decided to lose your soul and become an engineer.

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,810
And maybe they taught you about 3-point perspective.

31
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,800
Well and here's a drawing of 3-point perspective.

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,710
And basically what they're talking about is if I've got a cube in the,

33
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,970
in the, in the air.

34
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,190
That defines three sets of parallel lines.

35
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,420
Like the left face, the right face and then underneath.

36
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,250
And you could see that drawn here and that's where it comes from,

37
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,300
is that parallel lines converge to different Vanishing Points.

38
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,930
Here's another example I think, I think this is a Zisserman product,

39
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,750
I'm not sure, so just a really quaint old building.

40
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,220
And there's Vanishing point from the right, from the power lines there,

41
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,230
another Vanishing point on the left.

42
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,550
And without talking about others,

43
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,840
you can see where the horizon is, okay, right across there,

44
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,070
that's where all the lines for example, on the ground would converge.
