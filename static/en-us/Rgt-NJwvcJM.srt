00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,290
Furthermore, the instanceof operator works by checking to

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,050
see if the right operand's .prototype object can be

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,260
found anywhere in the left operand's prototype chain.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,980
Here, Car.prototype can be found somewhere in amy's prototype chain.

00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,120
With that in mind, let's peek at some functional class code again for a moment.

00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,500
What would you expect to be logged in this case?
