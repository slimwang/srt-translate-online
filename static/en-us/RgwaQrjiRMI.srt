1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,349
Working together, they can paint the room in 12 7ths hours time. Great thinking

2
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:11,600
if you found this fraction. 12 7ths is equal to 1 hour and 5 7ths of an hour.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,813
If we do some conversion and convert this to minutes, it's about one hour and

4
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:20,098
43 minutes. And here's the equation we want to set up. We know that Tim can

5
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:25,065
paint the room in 4 hours time. So he can complete one job in 4 hours. The

6
00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:28,475
other way of thinking about this is that he will complete 1 4th of the job in 1

7
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:34,428
hour. Vanessa's painted the room in 3 hours. Which means she can complete the

8
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:39,658
full job in 3 hours time, job per hours. So, notice that we can think about

9
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:44,452
this as a rate. We have Tim completing 1 job in 4 hours and Vanessa completing

10
00:00:44,452 --> 00:00:49,537
that same job in 3 hours. So if we add their two rates together, we would get

11
00:00:49,537 --> 00:00:54,298
them completing the job in x hours time, the time you want to find. And now

12
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:57,642
here's the other way we were thinking about it. Tim can complete 1 4th of the

13
00:00:57,642 --> 00:01:03,156
job in 1 hours time. Vanessa can complete 1 3rd of the job in 1 hours time. So

14
00:01:03,156 --> 00:01:08,354
together they can complete 1 over x of the job in 1 hour's time. We start

15
00:01:08,354 --> 00:01:12,791
solving this equation by multiplying though by the LCD. The least common

16
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:19,590
denominator is 4 times 3 times x. Or 12 x. We multiply each fraction by this

17
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:26,438
number, and that gives us 3 x here, 4 x here, and 12 here. We add our like

18
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:31,666
terms on the left to get 7 x equals 12. And finally we divide by 7 to get 1 x

19
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:36,574
is equal to 12 7ths. This is the amount of time it takes them to paint the room

20
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:37,660
together.
