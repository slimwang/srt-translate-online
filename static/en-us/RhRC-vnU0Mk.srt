00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,250
The key insight is that giant scale services are network bound

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,520
and not disk I/O bound. This is what helps in defining

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,270
the DQ Principle. The DQ Principle really helps the system

00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,750
designer in optimizing either for yield or harvest

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:26,350
for a given system capacity. Also, it helps the system designer

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:32,150
in coming up with explicit policies for graceful degradation of services

7
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:38,300
when either servers fail or load saturation happens or upgrades are planned.
