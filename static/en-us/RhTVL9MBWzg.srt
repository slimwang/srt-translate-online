1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,830
So now let's look at what
kinds of faults can we have.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,520
We can classify the faults by cause,
and we can have a hardware fault

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,890
when the hardware of the system fails
to perform as it was designed to do.

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,910
We can have design faults.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,140
For example, software bugs are design
faults, and also some of the hardware

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,000
design mistakes,
such as the famous Pantheon FDIV Bug,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,740
where this FDIV instruction was
not implemented correctly, so

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,110
if you gave it some
combinations of numbers,

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:34,190
you would get incorrect results,
and it was designed that way.

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,270
Then we have operation faults.

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,900
For example, operator and user mistakes.

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,980
For example, the operator accidentally
tells the system to shut down, and now,

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,780
of course, it no longer provides the
service that it's supposed to provide.

14
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,880
And then we can have environmental
faults, such as fire that

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,740
burns down the system, power failure,
sabotage of the system,

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,435
all things that in the environment may
cause the system to have an error,

17
00:01:02,435 --> 00:01:04,480
ar not perform the service.

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,450
Note that these are all false.

19
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,040
Some of them don't result in a failure.

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,360
For example, the FDIV bug
doesn't result in a error or

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,218
a failure, if you never really use
the wrong combination of numbers for it.

22
00:01:18,218 --> 00:01:24,890
A software bug in a rarely used function
may never result in an actual error.

23
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,200
Operator faults may not cause
a system to actually have an error.

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,250
For example if you shut down the system,
but at this time, for example, nobody's

25
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:39,920
trying to use it to get service from it,
it might not be an actual failure.

26
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,230
And then, we can have a fire but
if we protected our system from fire,

27
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,810
a fire in the system room may
not actually result in an error.

28
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,770
For example we can have a switch
over to another system.

29
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,950
Power failure can be mitigated so
it can be a fault, but

30
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,090
may not result in an error.

31
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,510
For example,
if our battery power supply lasts

32
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,130
long enough to overcome
the power failure, and so on.

33
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,310
So again these are faults
according to their cause.

34
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,970
Any of these faults might result in
errors, and subsequently failures, but

35
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,210
for all of them it is possible
that we get a fault but

36
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,300
not an error or a failure.

37
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,870
We can also classify faults by duration.

38
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,740
For how long do we have
the fault condition?

39
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,330
For example we can
have a permanent fault.

40
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,500
Once we have it,
it doesn't get corrected.

41
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,000
An example of a permanent fault is
when we want to see what's inside

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,300
the processor and
now the processor is in four pieces and

43
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,370
we don't know how to
put it back together.

44
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,110
We can have intermittent faults.

45
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,345
They last for a limited duration
of time but they are recurring.

46
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:50,410
So it's not like we get this type
of fault, and for a while it causes

47
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,200
things to not work fine, but then it
just disappears and never comes back.

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,420
This is something like, every couple
of seconds something happens.

49
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,130
A good example of intermittent fault
is when we overclock our system.

50
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,730
It works fine then crashes,
then we reboot it, it works fine,

51
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,780
it crashes, and so on.

52
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,970
So for a while it works fine, but
then the same type of problem recurs.

53
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,460
And then finally we have the transient
faults, which are when it lasts for

54
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,625
while, then just goes away.

55
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:21,020
A transient fault is for example,
when an alpha particle hits chips, so,

56
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,510
for a while,
it has all sorts of problems, but

57
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,345
then once we reboot it, it's no longer
going to have these problems and

58
00:03:27,345 --> 00:03:31,760
they're not going to occur again, until
much later when something else happens.
