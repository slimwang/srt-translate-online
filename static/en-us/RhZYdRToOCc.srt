00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,700
You're probably thinking at this point, this is really low

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,420
level. I really want to be able to pinch, zoom, and

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,590
rotate a single visual element. Well, that's a complex gesture

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,970
and there's no built-in gesture recognition in the web platform.

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,970
However, there are some great gesture recognition libraries out there.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,110
Hammer JS, JQTouch, even what's built into Centure touch. If

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,460
you want more complex gesture support you might want to look

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,530
at one of these. Rather than attempting to roll your own.
