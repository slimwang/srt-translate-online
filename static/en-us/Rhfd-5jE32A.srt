Let's look at the code that I wrote to do this. Here's all that stuff that we

2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:07,418
had to do just to make the computer happy. And then here's the interesting

3
00:00:07,418 --> 00:00:13,486
part. I wanted to print on two lines, so I used system out print line twice. On

4
00:00:13,486 --> 00:00:19,000
the first line, I wanted to print hello, so I put hello in quotes. And I passed

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,533
it out to system out print By putting it in the parentheses. On the second

6
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:26,986
line, I want it to print out world, so I write world in quotes and again, put

7
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:33,187
it in the parentheses. To run this in the Udacity IDE, I just copy this. I'm

8
00:00:33,187 --> 00:00:40,324
going to use Cmd+C or Ctrl+C depending on whether I'm on a Mac or a PC. And

9
00:00:40,324 --> 00:00:48,183
then I'm going to go to the Udacity IDE and I'm going to paste it in. Now I can

10
00:00:48,183 --> 00:00:57,520
test run it. And like I expected it prints hello and world on separate lines.
