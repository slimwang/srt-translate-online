1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
Now that you understand the AVAudioRecorder,

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,899
it's time to get the code into

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,450
Pitch Perfect. I’m currently open to the

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,279
RecordSoundsViewController.swift file.

5
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:11,968
Add the import statement for AVFoundation

6
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:13,740
right below the import

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,649
statement for UIKit. Inside the

8
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,359
RecordSoundsViewController class,

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,760
let's add a AVAudioRecorder property

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,018
called audioRecorder. While we're at it,

11
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:26,789
I’m also going to remove the

12
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,649
didReceiveMemoryWarning function, we don't need it

13
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:35,009
right now. In the recordAudio function,

14
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:36,869
add these lines of code for creating the

15
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:38,640
audio session and telling the AVAudioRecorder

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,369
to start recording audio.

17
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:42,689
You can find all the code that I have here

18
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:45,600
directly under the video. At this point,

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,308
our code is able to record the audio and

20
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:49,140
save it to the recordedVoice.wav file.

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,539
But what about when we want to stop

22
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,058
recording? That should be handled when

23
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:56,070
the Stop Recording button is pressed, and

24
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,659
you've already wired up that button to

25
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:01,229
fire the IBAction stopRecording.

26
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:04,379
Let's go there. In the stopRecording

27
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,629
function, add these three lines to stop

28
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:09,060
the recording. These lines both stop the

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,129
audio recorder and set the shared

30
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:14,879
AVAudioSession to inactive. And that's all

31
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,618
it takes, Pitch Perfect should now be

32
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,829
able to record your voice. To check that

33
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,118
things are working, let's print out the

34
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:29,079
file path when we start recording audio.

35
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:33,159
Let's go ahead and run our app. When we

36
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,840
click the Record button, we can see a

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,879
file path to the recordedVoice.wav

38
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:42,479
file.
