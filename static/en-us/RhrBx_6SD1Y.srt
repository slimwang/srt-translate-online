1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,543
This first trinomial can be factored as x plus 4 times x plus 6. We want factors

2
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:10,887
of positive 24 that sum to positive 10. The second trinomial can be factored

3
00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:15,428
into x plus 5 times x plus 4. We want factors of positive 20 that sum to

4
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:19,594
positive 9. Once we have our factored form, we cancel the factors that appear in

5
00:00:19,594 --> 00:00:24,190
the numerator and the denominator so we're left with x plus 6. Divided by the

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,917
quantity, x plus 5. Great work if you've got this as your final rational

7
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:29,763
expression.
