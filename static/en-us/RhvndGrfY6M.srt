00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,497
The last personality disorder that we're going to discuss, some of you may of

2
00:00:03,497 --> 00:00:10,901
heard of. It's called, antisocial personality disorder, or ASPD. Now this is

3
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:15,536
formally know as psychopathic or sociopathic behavior. Now antisocial

4
00:00:15,536 --> 00:00:19,622
personality disorder, is a serious and potentially dangerous disorder. It is

5
00:00:19,622 --> 00:00:23,838
marked by extremely impulsive deceptive, violent, ruthless and callous

6
00:00:23,838 --> 00:00:29,086
behavior. The key here is antisocial personality disorder focuses on outward

7
00:00:29,086 --> 00:00:33,805
behaviors. Where as the term, psychopath typically focuses on inward

8
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:39,110
characteristics. People with antisocial personality disorder are more likely to

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:44,378
engage in criminal, deceptive and violent behaviors. For example, an individual

10
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,972
with this disorder may break the law repeatedly. Be able to act charming and

11
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:53,554
witty, steal and fight often. They won't show guilt or remorse, and they can

12
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:57,770
become very angry and arrogant. Now, they're really good at manipulating other

13
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,890
people, and have a complete disregard for the safety of others. Many more men

14
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,262
than women have this disorder. And it's common among people in prison. As with

15
00:01:07,262 --> 00:01:11,611
other disorders, genetic and environmental factors are known to contribute. For

16
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:15,202
example, children who suffered from child abuse people with an antisocial

17
00:01:15,202 --> 00:01:18,565
parent, or people with alcoholic parents, are at an increased risk for

18
00:01:18,565 --> 00:01:23,640
developing this disorder. In addition a lot of research has revealed, that

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,117
those are the antisocial personality disorder, especially the violent

20
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:30,879
criminals, have amygdala that are unusually distorted in size, activity, and

21
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,160
function.
