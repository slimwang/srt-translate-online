1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is adults.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
To see this, let's look at how the data is spread out along this scatter plot.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We can see that from the mean somewhere right around here

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the spread between the high and the low points is something like this,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
whereas for children's heights the spread looks more like--

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Looking at ranges doesn't really tell you what the standard deviation is,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
but they are both measures of spread,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and when there aren't really outliers such as in this case, they tend to tell you the same thing.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And then just looking at the data,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
it looks pretty clear that it's spread out more in this direction than in this direction.
