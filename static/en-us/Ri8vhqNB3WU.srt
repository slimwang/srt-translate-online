1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,220
We don't need to worry about
reporting on its progress.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,380
So for unused params we should
specify Void as the data type.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,840
For the third and final generic param,

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,035
we want EarthquakeAsyncTask to take
a string URL as input for the task.

5
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:19,365
The task should return a list
of earthquake objects,

6
00:00:19,365 --> 00:00:22,295
which we can use to update
the list view in the screen.

7
00:00:22,295 --> 00:00:24,570
So here, we'll specify List
