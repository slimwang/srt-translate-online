00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,320
Some good ways to create competition is
by letting players compare their high

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,260
scores or
achievements with other players.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,500
So for example, I might choose to keep
track of the level a player gets to and

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,220
how many aliens they shot.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,340
And make a leaderboard to show who has
the highest score in these categories.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,520
You can also keep track of who
maintain the least amount of damage or

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,330
any other competitive
measures you can think of.

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,880
You could also build an option for
a two-player game.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,410
So that two players compete
to shoot the most aliens.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,090
The important thing is that you create
competition by involving a larger part

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,530
of your gaming community and letting
them compare their game performance.
