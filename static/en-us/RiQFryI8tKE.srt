1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here's my solution. I have to define the start state given a set of people that are on the here side.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I have to define the here side and just make sure that we throw in the flashlight there.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Then on the other side there's nobody.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Lowest<u>cost</u>search--starting from the start state, we've already defined the successor function.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm defining a new function to test for a goal.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We already defined the cost function.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The new function to test for the goal is right here.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It says if not here--in other words, if there's nothing here, if there's nobody here at all,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
it's the empty set, or if here is only the set of the flashlight.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That normally wouldn't happen, but I guess it could happen

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
if the initial problem was there's no people and just a flashlight.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Then you've got a solution with doing nothing at all.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I just wanted to make sure I covered that trivial case.
