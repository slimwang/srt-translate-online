00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,569
There are lots of ways to loop
over arrays in JavaScript, and

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:05,810
each way has its pros and cons.

3
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:07,869
For loops are very versatile and

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,519
give you complete control
over the looping process.

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,649
You can explicitly define
where to start and

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,609
stop in the array, whether you want
to skip over values in the array, and

7
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:19,649
even whether you'd like to break out of
the loop early, using a break statement.

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,019
When it doubt, you can probably
use a for loop to do it.

9
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:27,469
forEach gives you a concise
way of looping over an array

10
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:31,329
if you know you are going to be looping
over every element from start to finish.

11
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:34,809
You have less versatility than
you do with a regular for loop.

12
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,910
But you can access each element
directly, which is nice.

13
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,319
And you don't need to use an index
of an element to do that.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,200
Map is one more ray method you'll
want in your Java Script tool belt.

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,885
Similar to forEach, you can define
a callback function that performs

16
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:53,000
an operation on each
element in the array.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,969
The difference here is
map returns a new array

18
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:59,179
with the new values to
your function calculated.

19
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:00,880
So there you have it.

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,170
There are tons of ways to
iterate over a data in array.

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,939
And you can check out even more of them
by reading the Mozilla documentation.

22
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,560
But for now,
you've got three you can pull from,

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,890
depending on what you
need to accomplish.

24
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,120
For loops, forEach, and

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,870
now map, if you need to create
a new array using our function.
