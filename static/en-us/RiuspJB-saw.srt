00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,520
3 j s also has some built in support for object rotation. The call is like this,

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,280
you can specify x y or z for the axis of rotation. The object will rotate around

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,250
it's center along that axis in a counter clock wise fashion. The angle is

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,200
specified in radians which computers like, as a human I like degrees. So here

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,640
I'm specifying 70 degrees then converting this number to radians by multiplying

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,032
by PI over 180. Here we can see the direction is counterclockwise if you were to

7
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:31,850
point the x axis toward you. A way to remember this direction is the right-hand

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,000
rule. Even though it looks clockwise in this figure, if you put your thumb along

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,032
the x axis and rotate around you'll see it's indeed following the right-hand

10
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:40,392
rule.
