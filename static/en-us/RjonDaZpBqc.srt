00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,970
Consider this graph.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,380
Suppose you want to coarsen two subsets
of vertices into super vertices.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,250
That is, suppose you want to merge these
two vertices into a super vertex, and

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,050
you also want to merge these three
vertices into a super vertex.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,530
Structurally, you would get
the following coarsened graph.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,410
Here's what I want you to do.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,980
I want you to compute
the weights of the vertices and

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,580
the edges in the coarsen
graph representation.

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,570
Type your answers into the boxes.

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,380
These red boxes are for edges,
and the brown boxes are for

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,330
the two super vertices.

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,890
Assume that all vertex and
edge weights in the original graph,

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,964
on the left, are equal to 1.
