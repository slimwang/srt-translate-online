00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,880
I'm going to help you get going with your code. And, the first

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,980
thing you're going to need to do, is set up your development environment.

00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,710
Actually, that's the second thing you need to do. The first thing

00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,100
I'm going to have you do is download the code that you're going to

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,880
be using in this course. So to get the code, all you

00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,950
have to do is click this Download ZIP button here in the

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,490

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,640
downloaded it, expand the ZIP and you'll see all the

10
