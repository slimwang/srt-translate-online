1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,460
Now let's implement
the startOver method.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,470
How should we implement this method?

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,590
Which class should be responsible for
navigating back to the root of the app?

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:13,130
In this case, the answer is
the UINavigationController class.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,200
Each ViewController has
a navigation controller property.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,640
It's an optional that references
the navigation controller that a given

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,650
ViewController is embedded in.

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,800
When a ViewController receives
the indication to start over,

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,400
it can communicate with
the navigation controller.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,960
And here you can see the careful
unwrapping of the optional.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,990
We could just pop off the current
view controller like this, but

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,180
we want to go all the way
back to the beginning.

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,060
So we call popToRootView controller.

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,090
Here's a recap of the two
properties we just learned about.

15
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,022
The navigation item property
specifies features of the nav bar.

16
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:50,420
The navigationController property
provides a reference back to

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,940
the navigation controller for

18
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,810
programmatic control of
view controller popping.

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,270
Now take some time to get to
know these properties and

20
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,360
get that start-over button working for
all the endpoints in your story.
