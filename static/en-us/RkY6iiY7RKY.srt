00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's now do the variances. The first one we can copy over, but what is the second number?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Well, you might vaguely remember that the sum of two coin flips or sum of any two

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
of anythings you do, the variances just add up.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
With this formula in mind, we find that the variance of two coin flips is 0.5,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the variance of the sum of 10 coin flips which is 2.5, which is 10 times the number over here.
