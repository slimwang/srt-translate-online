00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,907
In addition to the evolutionary model of motivation, we also have what's called

2
00:00:03,907 --> 00:00:08,194
the drive reduction model. And, if you remember from lesson three, we talked

3
00:00:08,194 --> 00:00:12,794
about the brain and homeostasis. And homeostasis is at the center of the drive

4
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:17,542
reduction model. Now, this model states that our bodies will strive to maintain

5
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:22,660
homeostasis. Psychologists have suggested that we have what's called a set

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:28,002
point and a set point is an ideal fixed setting of a physiological system. Such

7
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:33,094
as our temperature or even our respiration. Now our brains have the ability to

8
00:00:33,094 --> 00:00:36,922
detect our physiological states and in turn our brains can activate a feedback

9
00:00:36,922 --> 00:00:42,810
system that helps the body maintain physiological states. At their ideal set

10
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,380
point. Let's take a look at an example. Let's say you find yourself in the

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:53,110
Upper Peninsula of Michigan in January, without a hat, coat, or shoes. Now,

12
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,391
that's a very cold place to be. According to the drive reduction model, what

13
00:00:56,391 --> 00:01:01,132
would happen to your body? Well, first your brain would detect those changes in

14
00:01:01,132 --> 00:01:05,068
your physiological states. Most notably temperature and it would start a

15
00:01:05,068 --> 00:01:09,144
cascade of events that would allow you to try to increase your temperature. For

16
00:01:09,144 --> 00:01:13,350
example, you may rub your hands together. Rub your hands on your arms to warm

17
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,406
yourself up. Jump up and down or even eventually begin to shiver. So this

18
00:01:18,406 --> 00:01:22,365
demonstrates how our body detects the change in our temperature. And it being

19
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:25,415
outside of the ideal set point, and allowed you to do things to try to raise

20
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:27,300
that temperature.
