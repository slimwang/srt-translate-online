1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,180
The code to do this is almost identical to the code we've used in

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,350
our scatter plot.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,270
First, we create an extent, but in this case we're using our nested object.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:16,030
And in our accessor function, we have to first reach into the values attribute

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:22,310
of our object and then grab the attendance, which we then use in our D3 scale.

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,730
In this case, we're setting it up to be a square root scale with input domain

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:33,050
equal to the extent we just created, and range on the order of 0 to 12.

8
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,000
Now, both for the type of scale we use.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,030
Whether it's the square root, logarithmic, linear, and

10
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,240
what output range we choose.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,360
It often takes some experimentation and

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,710
playing around with values to find out what visually looks the best.

13
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,030
And now we can properly scale our attendance values,

14
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,150
returning them in our accessor function for

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,870
the radius, and reload our page to see what affect this has had.

16
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,300
Well, as you can see here,

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,280
the circles have shrunken back down to a manageable size.

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,780
And we can see that there's some variation in how big they are,

19
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,400
which corresponds to the attendance for each
