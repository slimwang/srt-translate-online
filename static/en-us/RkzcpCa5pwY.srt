Clock radios are a common consumer device which people can use without any

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,420
training and without normally making any mistakes. Never the less they

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,870
are complex, as the state chart we have produced indicates. In fact, the clock

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:17,540
radio that I have at home has a bug in it. If you get awakened by the radio,

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,980
turn it off and then change the alarm time to a later time. For example,

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,140
to waking your spouse, the radio comes back on. It still thinks that within,

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,560
that it is within the hour window. Okay I call that a bug and

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,360
I think that the original designers of the radio should have detected this

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,140
particular situation and change that implementation. In any case it is

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,230
only by carefully modeling and validation that such situations can be avoided.

11
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:52,470
State charts are a device that can help you do that careful thinking and

12
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,930
hopefully lead to better implementations, better understanding of

13
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,700
complex situations and ultimately better implementations of them.
