Here is my answer. Here is the expand command.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It takes the omega vector and turns it in to a 4 x 4

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and assigns the existing coordinate to 0, 1, and 2

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and expands to make xi vector of 4 x 1

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
where it uses the previous dimensions of 0, 1, 2, and 0.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That turns out to make a larger matrix and larger vector.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now, I go and add in the measurement constraints.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In all of those, I have to relate to the last coordinate,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
which is my measurement coordinate from the first, the second, and the third pose.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And I have to subtract -z0, 1, and 2 from the corresponding robot poses

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and add them all up back to the last pose.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If you implement this correctly, then you get a omega and xi

13
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that, once you implement this solution equation, gets you this solution over here.
