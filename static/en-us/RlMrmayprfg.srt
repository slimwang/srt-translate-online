1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,080
It would be good if when I get to
the end of my story, I could start over.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,680
So that I can see all the different
possibilities for the tigers fate.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,876
Here's what that would look like.

4
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:19,390
Where in the storyboard,
should we put the start over button?

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,760
We could drag separate buttons into
each of the end points in Storyboard.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,470
But we need to consider this,

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,630
what class is the object that
would receive these actions?

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,490
If we look in the Identity Inspector,
we see that the View Controller for

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,820
each story node is a UIViewController.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,520
We can't add an action method directly
to a Stock UIViewController class.

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,240
The name of the subclass we're
using is MYOAViewController,

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,920
as you can see here in
the project navigator.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,820
So, we'll go back to the Identity
Inspector, and we'll add that class name

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,795
so that we can programmatically
add a button to each story node.

15
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:55,355
By the way,

16
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:59,435
a detailed review of these steps will be
provided in the next part of the lesson.

17
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,905
Okay.
Let's see about adding that

18
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:03,015
button in code.

19
00:01:03,015 --> 00:01:06,440
Every View Controller has a property
called a Navigation Item.

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,003
This item can be used to
control the title and buttons.

21
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:13,535
Here in the Navigation Item
documentation,

22
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:16,000
you can see that it has
a right bar button item.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,740
With these two lines of code,
we can add the right bar button item in

24
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,190
the viewDidLoad method and
specify the title, start over.

25
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,400
Now, we'll run it and see where we are.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,940
Well, there's our button, but

27
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,970
naturally it doesn't lead anywhere
because we haven't set the target yet.
