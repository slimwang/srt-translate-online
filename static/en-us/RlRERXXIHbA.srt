00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,807
The SyncManager does schedule 
your SyncAdapter jobs

2
00:00:02,807 --> 00:00:05,400
but they don't have anything to do
with what goes over the wire.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,130
There's no standard 
synchronization protocol.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,720
And while they are
tied to AccountManager,

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,850
they have nothing to do 
with storing account information.

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,640
However, they will 
auto retry requests,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
if network conditions are spotty.
