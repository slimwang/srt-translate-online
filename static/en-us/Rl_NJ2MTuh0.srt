I think it will be helpful for us to visualize the relationship between, total

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,768
income and total pay in taxes. So, let's graph it. If we want to graph income

3
00:00:09,768 --> 00:00:14,746
on the horizontal axis. In taxes owed on the vertical axis, both measured in

4
00:00:14,746 --> 00:00:19,670
dollars. What will the slope of the line we draw represent. Will it represent

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,551
the tax rate, written as a percent? The tax rate written as a decimal, the

6
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:28,189
total tax paid, or the total income earned.
