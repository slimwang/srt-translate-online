00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,320
The signature gives the name of the program, the names and

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,570
types of the input arguments, and the name and type of the results. For SORT,

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:14,460
the signature looks like the following. Vector of type integer Y equals the SORT

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,290
of the Vector of type integer X. That is, SORT takes a single argument named X,

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,990
that has a datatype, which is a Vector of integers.

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,870
And produces, produces, as a result, Vector Y, which also holds ints.
