1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,260
So, by now you may be a little curious as to why are we trying to do this?

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,070
So, let's look an example that we have looked at before.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,420
You may recall this image that we looked at before,

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,820
where we generated a panorama.

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,740
And if you look at this carefully, you'll see,

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,270
again, that there are different subimages in this image.

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,720
So for example, you can see some of the boundaries of different images here.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,453
And of course, each and every one of them is a separate image of their own, and

9
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:26,441
what we're interested in now is taking all of these images and

10
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:29,950
merging them together so you would have a full panorama.

11
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,530
So this, of course, is the output.

12
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:37,130
Now you cannot see any lines across the whole spectrum of this panorama.

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,940
All different images have been merged together.

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,867
I will flip back to the previous one again.

15
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:48,492
So just looking at these flips,

16
00:00:48,492 --> 00:00:52,198
you should be able to see that the basic boundaries between

17
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:57,040
different subimages have vanished to generate a complete smooth image.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,580
And that actually is what, the output we were looking at.

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,600
So in this lecture we will look at is how to go about coming at

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,790
various techniques we can to be able to blend images so

21
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,180
these types of edges that exist when you merge two images together vanish.
