1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,460
So, what'd you get?

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,710
I got 70 microns.

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,690
One round trip, from center to corner
and back, is l square root of 2.

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,490
Recall that your goal is to do
three trillion of these round

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,170
trips, per second.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,840
So how do you get to 3 trillion
operations per second?

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,020
Each operation is a round trip,
each round trip is l root 2,

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,540
units of distance.

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,080
So think of this distance, l root 2,
as being in units of, say, meters.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,500
You can travel this distance
at the signaling speed,

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,850
which is the speed of light,
by assumption.

12
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,689
Solve this equation for l.

13
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,100
Assuming I did the math right,

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,410
you should get about 70 microns
to one significant figure.

15
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,300
That is really tiny.

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,900
In fact,
it's about the width of a human hair.

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,700
Here's the point of this exercise.

18
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,980
To hit the target compute speed,
assuming information propagates

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,540
at the speed of light, a sequential
computer has to be really, really tiny.
