00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,860
Welcome to lesson three. In the last lesson, you've built

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,850
out your data model by connecting objects with relationships. Before

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,930
we talk about what you're going to do in this lesson,

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,640
let's follow Samantha and Andy back to the music festival.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,910
>> So this festival was tons of fun but

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,310
clearly at its core, it was a big business.

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,070
>> Yeah. We had to buy tickets to get in. We paid for

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,450
food. We bought a couple beers. We even paid to ride the Ferris Wheel.

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,240
>> And some people were even paying to do arts and crafts.

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,040
>> Music festival managers aren't just making

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,480
money, they have to spend it too.

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,750
>> Right! They have to pay for the bands, they

13
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,980
have to pay the salary of their employees. Pay for equipment.

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,440
>> So obviously, they're keeping track of all these revenues and costs.

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,849
>> And these numbers are so important that

16
00:00:39,849 --> 00:00:43,700
they probably want to understand them quickly and easily.

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,570
>> And in Salesforce, that means

18
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,670
visualizations like charts, reports and dashboards.
