00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,070
There are, however, some issues with design methods. You as a architect or

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,520
designer have to make some choice. Are you going to go do things top down,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,378
bottom up, inside out? There are a variety of choices there.

4
00:00:13,378 --> 00:00:16,827
Are you going to begin by thinking of the procedures and functions? Or

5
00:00:16,827 --> 00:00:20,331
are you going to begin by thinking in terms of the nouns and objects like you

6
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:24,320
would with objectory development. A topic which we'll come back to later in

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,290
the lesson is the issue of conceptual integrity versus cooperative development.

8
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:35,460
An important decision in many, software development shops is the trade off or

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,400
the tension between doing a design that takes a little bit more time.

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,680
In order to save yourself effort and money in the long term,

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,030
by supporting maintainable and general structures. Or are you going to be

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,950
dominated by short term delivery schedule. And finally, is the role of tools.

13
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,610
What, what tools are you going to use in terms of your particular design.
