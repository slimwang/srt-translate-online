1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,490
Now life gets uglier, rotation.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,490
What I have here is a figure, or I think this is also from four-side composite

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,310
slides, and what I'm showing you is two coordinate frames, A and B.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:19,570
And you'll notice that A has an I vector, a J vector and a K vector.

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,490
And B has an I vector, a J vector, and a K vector.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,570
And one of the important things to realize is that this P value,

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,410
the vector from the origin, is, can be expressed in two ways.

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,210
It can be expressed as some components in the a frame times the x, y,

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,550
z components, or some components in

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,320
the B frame with the components in the x, y, and z frame, right?

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,980
They're the same vector, right?

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,450
And what's key is understanding that there are these basis vectors and

13
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,640
we need to know the amount of component that multiples each of them.

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,700
What we want to be able to do is say we're going to rotate the frame from A to

15
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,350
B, and that's what this says.

16
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:10,360
What this says is given my point described in A, I'm going to have a rotation

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,870
operator that would give me the P now expressed in the B frame.

18
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:21,388
And R A to B means describing frame A in the coordinate system of B and it says,

19
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:26,473
so if you gave me the location of a point in terms of the components of A,

20
00:01:26,473 --> 00:01:30,524
this is and it's only a rotation after applying R,

21
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:33,490
I get the components in the frame B.
