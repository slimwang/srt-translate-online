1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,210
That brings us to this specific lesson

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,270
that we're going to cover in this lecture. DFS

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,490
wants to intelligently use the cluster memory

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,070
for the efficient management of the metadata associated

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,100
with the files. And for caching the

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,390
file content cooperatively among the nodes of the

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,339
cluster for satisfying future requests for files.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,420
In other words, what we would like to

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,150
do, is since we know that a disk is slow, we would like to avoid going to the

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,870
disk as much as possible. And retrieve the data from the memory of a peer in the

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,070
network if in fact that peer has previously

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,570
accessed the same file. And that's the idea behind

13
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,800
cooperative caching of files. But in order to fully

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,790
appreciate the question that we're asking and the answer

15
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,360
that we're going to discuss in this lesson,

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,140
it is important that you have a very good

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,500
understanding of file systems. If you don't have

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,990
it, don't worry. We have supporting lectures that will

19
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,880
help you get up to speed, and you can get this knowledge by diving into a good

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,820
under graduate textbook that covers this material well.

21
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,970
And the textbook that is used in the under

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,790
graduate systems course CS 2200 at Georgia Tech is a good resource for that.
