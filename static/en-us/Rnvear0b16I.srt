1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For which of these problems that a numerical approach be appropriate:

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
to determine the heat capacity of the oceans,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,000
to prove that Ï€/4=1-1/3+1/5-1/7 and so on and so on up to infinity, or

4
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to determine whether a control system is unconditionally stable or not.
