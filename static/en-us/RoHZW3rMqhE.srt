00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,075
The shocking truth is that the squares marked A and B are actually the same

2
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:08,476
shade of gray. If you don't believe it, here's a bit of proof. An image where

3
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:12,853
two vertical bands with the same shade of gray are overlaid on the image. So,

4
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:18,170
you can see here and here that these gray bars, they're all the same intensity.

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:23,852
And that they're also the same intensity as this A and this B square. So, these

6
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:28,576
are all the same gray, believe it or not. If you still don't believe it, you can

7
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:32,668
print out the original image and cut out squares A and B and hold them up next

8
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,117
to each other. See the additional course materials for where to get these

9
00:00:36,117 --> 00:00:41,284
images. As professor Adelson notes, this illusion proves that the visual system

10
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:45,270
is not a very good light meter, but that's not its purpose. Our visual system

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,230
tries to compensate for shadows and other distractions so that we can properly

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,483
perceive the nature of the objects in view.
