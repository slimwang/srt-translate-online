1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,730
The correct answer is all the above.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,935
For example,
by checking the HTTP referer header,

3
00:00:05,935 --> 00:00:10,753
bank.com would notice that
attacker.com is the referer, and

4
00:00:10,753 --> 00:00:14,520
then bank.com can stop
the payment requests.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,170
Similarly, bank.com can generate
a token and embed it with bill pay

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,020
form that is sent to the user's browser,
so that when it receives request from

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,610
the browser it can verify that
the request are from that bill pay form.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,020
In addition, these practices
will prevent a malicious script

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,630
from using the live
session to good site.
