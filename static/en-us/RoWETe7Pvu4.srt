1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,030
The number of columns in each odd row will be two, and in each even

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,800
row will be one. This is because the width is 1,900. So if we start from

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,420
all the way on the edge, we can fit 800 plus another 800 is 1,600, but

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,720
not another 800 which would give us 2,400. So that calculation was 1900

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,250
over 800, and then we lost the decimal. In the even

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,870
row, we had to subtract 400 from 1,900, because

7
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,730
we can't use these first 400 meters. Then we

8
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,255
can fit 800, and at this point we're at

9
00:00:34,255 --> 00:00:36,790
1,200, and if we add another 800, we would be

10
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,980
at 2,000, but that's more than 1,900, so that

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:45,080
wouldn't fit. So that calculation was 1,900, minus 400 over

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,880
800 and then we dropped the decimal. Let's write

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,300
an equation for this. Write it down and skip if

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,406
you know the rest. To calculate the number of columns per odd row, we calculated

15
00:00:56,406 --> 00:01:02,710
the width, which was 1,900 divided by the diameter, which was 800.

16
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:08,070
And then dropped the decimal. To calculate the number of columns per even row,

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,830
we started with the width, subtracted the

18
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,200
radius, or 400. Divided by the diameter,

19
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,790
and then again, tossed the decimal. Write

20
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,800
this down. You're going to want it for later.
