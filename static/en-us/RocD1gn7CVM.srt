1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,880
>> Image editing software like Photoshop and apps like Instagram or

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,000
Snapchat allow you to apply visual effects to images.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,810
You might be thinking why would I want to edit images in a browser?

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,240
>> It's a good question.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,720
For one thing, most photos only exist in digital formats.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,499
The computing power needed to process a single image is well,

7
00:00:18,499 --> 00:00:19,680
pretty much negligible.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,853
And doing things locally allows the user to make changes without a full

9
00:00:22,853 --> 00:00:24,425
round trip to the server and back.

10
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:26,564
And most importantly, it's actually a lot of fun.

11
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:27,545
>> Yeah.

12
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:31,605
We might make an image black and white by averaging the red, green and

13
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:32,880
blue values.

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,820
>> Or we could invert the colors by assigning the pixels to the compliments of

15
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,540
their current values.

16
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,691
>> Or maybe we wanted to turn down the lights and turn on night vision mode.

17
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:44,605
>> We'll be working without the help of an external library.

18
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:47,629
But check the instructor notes for software packages and

19
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:51,293
applications to make advance photo editing easy inside the canvas.
