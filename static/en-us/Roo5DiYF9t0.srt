00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now that we know how to reliably solve differential equations, we can return to rockets.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What make things easy is that we're going to fire the rocket only for seconds, not for minutes.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Think of what would happen if you could give the spacecraft an ultra-short but ultra-strong boost

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that would lead to an instantaneous change of the velocity.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
After that of course, also the position changes.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We have different trajectory but the only thing that we need to take account of

7
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to incorporate that boost is to change the velocity.
