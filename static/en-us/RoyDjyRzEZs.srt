00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,290
The thing that we're squaring here is everything inside the parentheses. So, we

2
00:00:05,302 --> 00:00:10,681
just want to multiply 5xy cubed by itself. If we expand this multiplication and

3
00:00:10,693 --> 00:00:15,412
then simplify, we end up with 25x squared y to the 6th. What we can see is that

4
00:00:15,424 --> 00:00:20,272
our end result here, takes each factor from the original quantity inside

5
00:00:20,284 --> 00:00:26,448
parentheses and squares it. So, 5 squared is 25, x squared is x squared, y cubed

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,205
squared is y to the 6th. So, you can think of this as the exponent distributing

7
00:00:32,217 --> 00:00:37,271
to every single factor that's multiplied together inside the term.
