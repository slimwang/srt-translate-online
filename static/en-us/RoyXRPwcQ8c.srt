00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Our next guest is Vukosi Marivate, who is currently a graduate student in computer science.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
He studies machine learning, but he's also a keen observer of the impact

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
of technology on world cultures.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
He's been in several technology companies,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and he's going to share some of his experiences with us.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We have with us Vukosi Marivate.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Vukosi lives in South Africa, and he's currently going to graduate school

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
in the United States to get his PhD in computer science.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
He has interned at a number of different companies,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and this summer he interned with a company called Meebo

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that does some social networking.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Can you tell me a little bit about Meebo?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What is it that they have been doing and where are they now?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
[Vukosi Marivate, Graduate Student, Rutgers University]

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Meebo was a company that did a couple of things.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
One was that they had a chat app.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Another is that they also did advertising through something called Meebo bar.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
They also then had a new product that was being developed

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to give you news, so you would actually log into the service,

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
put up what your interests are, and you would either be friends with other people on the network,

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and from there would actually mine the data that's created by all these people

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
to actually now give you news and information that's relevant to you.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Do you have a sense of what sort of algorithmic work they had to do

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
to support their company?

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
In most cases when you're looking at networks,

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
the things that are very interesting to do first

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
are dead simple ways to actually recommend who people should be friends with.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This goes across the spectrum whether you're on Facebook,

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
on Linked In, on Twitter, or Meebo, and Google+.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The other things that become more interesting is finding out who's important in a graph.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This is actually not as simple as just looking at who has the most connections.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Either has the most followers or the most friends and things like that,

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
but actually be who is the person where information flows through.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
There are algorithms that try to actually do this,

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and people are developing them using different metrics

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
to try to figure out who's important given a topic, let's say.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Finding out who is very important given ice cream in California.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Those kinds of problems normally require you to do

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
some mathematical modeling of the networks that you have.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Do you have a sense of what a really simple example of an algorithm might be

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
that would determine importance? Maybe not what people are really doing.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But something related to it.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
One could be looking at giving keywords that people use.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Given who uses those keywords, and then looking at if a person uses that keyword,

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
who then after that shares that keyword more and more.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Just looking at something that's called a "cascade"--

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
how information moves through a network,

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
but if you can look at the origin of where that keyword started

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and see how fast it grows, maybe, or how many people it gets to,

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
you can then go back to figuring out who then is important.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So, if you can figure out, let's say, who is important in burgers, right,

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
then you could then target advertising towards that person.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're advertising your product, and if they spread it, then you can then get to more people.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So, it's different to advertising a burger to me.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I probably don't have a lot of people who follow me because of my knowledge of burgers.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But there could be other people out there who people follow because of their information,

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
so if you can figure out who those people are, then you can advertise to them,

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and they can spread information.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I did a project at Rutgers where it tried to figure out

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
who was important given an edu-tainment TV show.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
In this case, I was trying to found out who was important in trying to spread information about HIV.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
In this case, it was not advertising but it's actually very important

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
in educating people.

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If you can figure out who spreads that information well,

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
you get to more people and you can have more impact.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That seems really important--yeah.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I mean, not just--all over the world, right?

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
There's these issues that are taking place.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What's your sense of what social networks are like in other countries outside the United States?

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Is it similar to the way it is here or are there variations?

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Because of differing bandwidth constraints,

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
you have some social networks more used in some countries than others.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You have countries that use Twitter, because it's very easy.

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
To get on it's very low bandwidth, and also it spreads information very quickly.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
More quickly than Facebook, and it's open.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Obviously, everybody knows about the Arab Spring now,

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and Twitter was very pivotal in that.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
In some countries there are other social networks that are very big there.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
They might not be big in the United States.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
In South Africa and some of most of Africa use something called "Mxit"--M-X-I-T,

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
which is based in South Africa. It was created there.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It has a huge user base in South Africa.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I think Orchid is still very big in South America,

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
which isn't quite as big as Google, but it's still spreading.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Just locally it's very big there.
