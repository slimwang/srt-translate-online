00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
Let me summarize. You learned two really important

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,673
things that we use every day in robot programming

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,606
and they were somewhat complementary. First

4
00:00:07,606 --> 00:00:09,574
we talked about smoothing which took a discrete

5
00:00:09,574 --> 00:00:13,239
path and turned it into continuous smooth path.

6
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:14,565
And then we turned about how the robot can

7
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:16,949
follow this smooth path, using a control

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,417
mechanism called PID. With this, you can

9
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:21,132
actually implement quite a bit of robotics,

10
00:00:21,132 --> 00:00:23,386
with no matter what robot you have, apply

11
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:26,953
a planner, apply a smoother, apply a controller

12
00:00:26,953 --> 00:00:29,648
and it will do just fine. In fact, this is about

13
00:00:29,648 --> 00:00:31,799
the level at which our DARPA Robot Challenge

14
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:33,599
car won the DARPA Robot Challenge . The

15
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:36,327
Google car itself has a little bit more juice

16
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,719
in it. It considers the case that the steering

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,942
wheel itself has inertia and that the steering

18
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:42,889
wheel was driven by something called torque

19
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:45,124
, not by position, but leaving this aside, you

20
00:00:45,124 --> 00:00:47,275
really got a gist out of what’s happening in

21
00:00:47,275 --> 00:00:49,152
robotic driving. And now we’re able to really

22
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:52,325
control an actual robot. Congratulations,

23
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:56,325
that is really, really cool.
