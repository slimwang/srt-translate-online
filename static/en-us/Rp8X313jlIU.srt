00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,789
So, if we walk these two distances, we know we need to add them together to find

2
00:00:03,801 --> 00:00:07,425
our total distance. I can't add the fractions yet because they have unlike

3
00:00:07,437 --> 00:00:11,326
denominators. I want you to find the common denominator for these two fractions.
