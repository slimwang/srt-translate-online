1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,380
There's definitely other entities and
companies that could utilize the data.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,890
We already are sharing information
with other shelters in our community,

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,880
we're all part of a group
called The We Care Coalition.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,950
We share data, as far as difficult
medical cases, difficult behavior cases.

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,900
We also share our save rate, meaning
the amount of animals that we bring into

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,450
the shelter versus the amount of animals
that we actually save and rehome.

7
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,830
We share that with organization
called Maddie's Funds,

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,100
which they provide a free
adoption day every single year to

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,470
communities based on what
their save rates are.
