1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,750
Now, I don't want you to feel intimidated by all of these complexity classes

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:10,370
rather you should be proud of yourself and I would say congratulations to you

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,380
for having learned so much in this course about computational complexity

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,620
where you met Alice, Bob, and Carol and later, we also met Dave

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,000
We didn't know anything about their problems.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,830
We didn't know if there was a good algorithm for vertex cover or if we just couldn't find one.

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,890
Similar for clique and independent set and shortest tour.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,509
Later, we also learned about SAT and then we started out with the concept of NP completeness,

9
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,050
which suggested that many of these problems here are hard.

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,700
Then we went on to search trees to show how some of these problems

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,259
nevertheless can be solve efficiently, and we introduced the concept of pre-processing.

12
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:45,500
We showed that some problems are fixed using parameter tractable

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,540
using either the size of the solution or some parameter such as distance

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,370
from triviality as a parameter.

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,650
We talked about constant factor approximation algorithms, the concept of a PTAS,

16
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,730
problems for which there's likely no constant factor approximation algorithm

17
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,300
unless P=NP.

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,909
We talked about Monte Carlo randomized algorithms.

19
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:08,280
We talked about Las Vegas randomized algorithms.

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,810
And we talked about which of these problems, although worst-case analysis

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,509
might suggest otherwise are usually very well solvable in practice.

22
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:19,500
This is my final quiz for you in this unit.

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,570
What I would like you to do is think about all the things you now know about these problems

24
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,210
what you know about vertex cover, what you know about clique and independent set,

25
00:01:28,210 --> 99:59:59,999
about shortest tour, and 3-SAT and then just make check marks here on what you know.
