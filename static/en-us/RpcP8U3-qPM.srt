1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now we're going to use Euler's formula to give us a handle on how fast edges grow

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
relative to the number of nodes in a planar graph.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We're going to make use of two other facts.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
One is that every region in a planar graph has to be encapsulated--has to be bounded--

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
by at least three edges for it to be a region.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It might be more that that, but it has to be at least three.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If you think about three times the number of regions,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the number of edges has to be at least that big, though, we're counting each edge twice,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
because each edge can actually participate in two regions.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Twice the number of edges has to be bigger than or equal to three times the number of regions.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Rewriting Euler's formula, we have this--rewriting this equation, we have this.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Substituting in, we have this.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's multiply through by 3. We get 3m + 6 â¤ 3n + 2m.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Subtract m from both sides and subtract 6 from both sides, a

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and we get m, the number of edges, can't be any bigger than 3n - 6,

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
which this expression is in Î(n).

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The most edges that we can have in a planar graph is at most linear in the number of nodes.
