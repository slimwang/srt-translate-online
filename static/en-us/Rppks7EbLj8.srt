1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,204
For the first calculation, we have that 99% of

2
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:05,868
the time it only costs four cycles, and 1%

3
00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:08,840
of the time it costs 100 cycles. For a

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,849
total of 4.96. And for the second, we have that

5
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:15,774
90% of the time, it costs four cycles, and

6
00:00:15,774 --> 00:00:19,500
10% it cost 100 cycles. Giving us a total

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,830
of 13.6. This may be a little bit counterintuitive

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,560
to see that a relatively small change in the percentage

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,410
can have such a dramatic change in the speed. And

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,890
the key is to think about the fact that it's actually

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,207
really the miss rate that matters here. We're improving it

12
00:00:36,207 --> 00:00:40,071
by a factor of ten, with having a 99% hit rate.
