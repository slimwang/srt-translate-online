1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,058
There is however,

2
00:00:01,058 --> 00:00:03,750
another way of thinking about
the tracking that I just showed you.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,837
Let's not worry too much about
the mean shifting part of it and

4
00:00:07,837 --> 00:00:11,294
just this idea of using
the color distribution as a,

5
00:00:11,294 --> 00:00:16,910
the matching of the color distribution,
the similarity as a sensor model.

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,958
Okay?

7
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:21,318
Because when we do this mean shift and
we're tracking the single peak,

8
00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:24,230
we're a little bit back to like
our Kalman universe, right?

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,000
Where the idea is there's
a single hypothesis.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,389
We could just use this similarity
function, the matching function

11
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:37,370
of the color distributions as the sensor
model for particle filtering.

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,791
That is your particles spread out and
they want to say, well,

13
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,744
what's the probability
of getting this sensor

14
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:46,583
measurement if that's
actually the mice state.

15
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,516
Well, you can simply say, well,

16
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:52,649
it's just a measure of how close the
color distribution is using that body

17
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,333
chart distance of some other way
of comparing of distributions.

18
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,463
And in fact, people have done this and

19
00:00:58,463 --> 00:01:01,000
now I have to show you
a totally unfair slide.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,402
And the reason it's unfair
is this slide I found,

21
00:01:04,402 --> 00:01:09,940
I was looking is in a presentation
given online, talking about mean shift.

22
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,449
I don't actually know the source of
this picture, so I can't give you the,

23
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,500
the reference to look it up, etc.

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,375
And then they show this
interesting thing where the mean

25
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:25,083
shift is tracking this cute little
kid and then falls apart, okay?

26
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,560
Now why would it fall apart?

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,750
This is a little bit sneaky.

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,730
You'll notice this brown envelope
cardboard box in the background.

29
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,293
It has some color distributions
similar to the face of the kid.

30
00:01:37,293 --> 00:01:40,004
So, if you've ever thought little kids
are really, pretty much cardboard boxes,

31
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:40,960
you're right.

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,833
Or at least,
that's what mean shift says.

33
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:47,168
And then what they showed is that
if you used a particle tracker,

34
00:01:47,168 --> 00:01:50,800
particle filter tracker,
it falls off a little bit.

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,000
See, it fell off, but
then it catches back on.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,840
That's what particle filters do, right?

37
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,167
They entertain multiple hypothesis.

38
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:02,707
So, even if some weird hypothesis is
looking good as long as the real one

39
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:05,421
eventually becomes better,
it'll come back to it and

40
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:07,400
that's what its showing here.

41
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,287
But basically, the idea is you can use
the similarity function of the two color

42
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:16,000
distributions as your sensor model for
a particle filter.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,469
And this relates to this idea
of what I said before that,

44
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:20,583
particle filters really
are pretty flexible.

45
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:24,370
You can pull out whatever sensor model
you want to use as long as you can put

46
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,480
it within this Bayesian
framework of p of z, given x.
