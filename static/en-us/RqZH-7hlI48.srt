Three.js gives you a bunch of ways to form rotation matrices. Here's what one of

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,238
them looks like. A rotation around the z axis. The Greek letter theta is the

3
00:00:08,238 --> 00:00:12,167
angle of rotation. The cosine and sine of this angle are used to form a somewhat

4
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:17,343
symmetric piece of the matrix here. The rest of the matrix is left alone by

5
00:00:17,343 --> 00:00:22,015
leaving these values in the third row 0 and this value here being 1 this has the

6
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:26,810
effect of leaving the z coordinate untouched. This makes sense since when you

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,278
rotate around the z axis the z values shouldn't change. Here's a real rotation

8
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,934
matrix around the z axis. For rotation angle of 53.1 degrees. As an example the

9
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:42,849
coordinate 1, 0, 0 transforms to the coordinate 0.6, 0.8, 0, the coordinate is

10
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:47,818
rotated counter clockwise around the origin. One way top look at things is the

11
00:00:47,818 --> 00:00:51,636
rotating a point from one location to another. Another way to look at it is that

12
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:55,572
you're changing the frame of reference. The rotation transform can also be

13
00:00:55,572 --> 00:01:00,025
thought of taking original point. I'm looking it up to see what value it has on

14
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:05,592
these two new axis. For example on our new x axis the point's coordinate is 0.6,

15
00:01:05,592 --> 00:01:10,960
on our new y axis the point's coordinate is 0.8, on the left we're rotating

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,712
coordinate with respect to the axis. On the right we're rotating the axis and

17
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:21,274
then seeing where the coordinate lies with respect to these axis'. Either

18
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:25,462
interpretation is correct and both have their strengths. If we rotate the first

19
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:29,947
interpretation so that the x and y axis are aligned with the second, we see that

20
00:01:29,947 --> 00:01:34,506
the transformed point is in the same orientation to the axis in both cases. This

21
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:38,400
second interpretation is the one that helped me understand how a dot product is

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,191
rotating a point. And in earlier lesson, we've talked about how the dot product

23
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:45,510
between two normalized vectors gives us the cosine of the angle between them.

24
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,885
Rotation is a similar use of the dot product. We use the cosine of the rotation

25
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:53,980
angle to give us two new axis, both of which are normalized, that is the links

26
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,096
are both one. The dot product between our test point coordinates, and each

27
00:01:58,096 --> 00:02:03,410
rotation axis gives us the coordinate of the new location. For example, 0.6 is

28
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:08,630
here, and 0.8 goes over here. A dot product projects one vector onto another,

29
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,970
which is what gives us these coordinates. That was a simple test case where the

30
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,726
vector to our test point was of length one. If we do the same analysis for

31
00:02:16,726 --> 00:02:20,350
another point, we get the same result with both ways of thinking. Here's a new

32
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,606
point, which has the same location on both of our graphs. On the left, we rotate

33
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:29,680
the point to its new position. Then read the coordinates off of its axis. On the

34
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,036
right, we rotate the axis and read the points coordinates with respect to these

35
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:39,515
axis. For example, here's X's and Y's. The way we read off these coordinates is

36
00:02:39,515 --> 00:02:44,162
to take a dot product between each axis and the vector to the point. So here's

37
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:48,295
our x axis and here's our vector. And we take a dot product between the two to

38
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:52,670
get this value here. This is what a matrix does. It computes a dot product. When

39
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,166
we use the dot product for materials both vectors were normalized. Here our axis

40
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:01,997
is normalized, but the vector to the point is not. The vector here could be of any length.
