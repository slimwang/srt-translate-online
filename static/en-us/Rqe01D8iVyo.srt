00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,421
Right now, Grant's booth area at the Expo is 10 feet wide by 15 feet long. That

2
00:00:05,421 --> 00:00:10,708
gives him a total area of 150 feet squared. Since area is just length times

3
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:16,268
width, which is 10 times 15. Now this whole slingshot game is taking up a ton of

4
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:21,351
space. In fact, he's already way outside his boundaries in terms of where the

5
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:25,982
ball is ending up. He's also worried that if people throw really poorly, they're

6
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:30,365
going to hit people in other booths. That would definitely not be good marketing

7
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:34,612
for Grant's Gleaming Glasses. The person in charge of the Expo told Grant that

8
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:38,712
he can, in fact, expand the space that he is in under one condition. He has to

9
00:00:38,712 --> 00:00:43,332
increase his dimensions by the same amount In both directions, if he's going to

10
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:48,091
make this any bigger. For now, I'm going to call that link that we're going to

11
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:52,834
add on, x. Grant, ambitious as always, wants to double the area of his booth.

12
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:57,539
That way he'll have 300 square feet of space to do whatever he wants with. The

13
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,221
question is, how much does he need increase these dimensions by? What does x

14
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:04,325
need to equal to make this happen?
