Thanks Kai/g. Let's do an exercise where we match the methods with their

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,090
classes. Don't worry if you're not sure how to do this yet. I haven't actually

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,145
given you enough information, just go with your gut. Here's the first one.

4
00:00:09,145 --> 00:00:14,710
BirthDay.getmonth. Here, the method is getmonth. "Hello world!".length, here

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,829
length is the method. Anniversary.addDays, here the method is addDays. And

6
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:27,910
lolcatsPic.draw, here the method is draw. Enter the letter for the class, in

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,830
the box next to the method call.
