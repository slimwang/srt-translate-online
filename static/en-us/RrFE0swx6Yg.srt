1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,080
Listing education is your next step
in building your master resume.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,200
An important thing to note about
the education section, is that it can

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,880
include a variety of forms beyond
the traditional college experience.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,650
Just be sure to present this in an
organized way on your targeted resume.

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,335
Within the education section,
include any degrees,

6
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:20,150
certificates, credential, etc.

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,200
Also note, high school education
need not be included on your resume

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,670
after college.

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,950
When organizing this information,
organize the category,

10
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,560
university degrees,
certificates, courses, workshops.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,140
This helps visually
organize your experience.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,080
Within each subheading, place the most
recent experience at the top.

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,070
It might be helpful to note that you
don't need to include the specific years

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,280
that you graduated.

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,480
You didn't have to include a GPA, but
if you've got a great GPA, a 3.5 or

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,260
above, for example, you can.
