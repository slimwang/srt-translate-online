1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,540
I started with the smiley face.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,230
I added the meta tag with a character
set of utf-8 to the head of the page.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,800
This is so
that Unicode characters get recognized.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,910
Then all I had to do was go to
the Unicode site and copy and

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,980
paste this smiley face here.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,010
To add the social media icons,

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,750
I added a link to Zocial in the head
using the weloveiconfonts website.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,770
At the bottom of the page,

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,130
I added a footer tag with a div
inside with an id of social.

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,400
Inside, there are four a tags,
each of which has a different class.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,570
Notice how all the classes
start with zocial, and

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,620
then a dash, and
then the Zocial icon that I wanted.

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,710
So I've got Twitter,
Facebook, Google+, and Digg.

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,000
I thought the logos looked just
a little bland on their own, so

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,505
I wound up using some CSS
to give them some shadows.

16
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:47,760
And in the end, I thought
the flourish was just a little silly.

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,210
So I added a slight border using
border-bottom to the end of the article.

18
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,850
I think this is a little bit classier
and it avoids some extra bytes for

19
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,230
the flourish.

20
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,270
You could have also used
some kind of svg here, but

21
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,150
I decided to go with a little
bit more subtle approach.

22
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,870
Oh, and here's my svg logo.

23
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,680
It's pretty simple, so I just simply
inlined it here inside the header.

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,350
All right.

25
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,660
This blog is looking
much more reasonable.

26
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,560
We've dropped some unnecessary bytes in,
added some social media icons.

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,540
At the end of the next lesson,

28
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,212
you'll have one more opportunity to
really make this blog's images shine.
