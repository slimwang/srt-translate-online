00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,030
Congratulations, we're now at the end of this course. We're so proud

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,200
of you. It's been great to have you with us all this time.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,830
>> You're well on your way to building

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,460
great applications that run in the Google Cloud.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,590
>> But guess what?

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,900
>> We're going to be launching more courses about the Google

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,080
Cloud Platform so make sure you look out for those.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,260
But in this course, you also saw how to build

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,350
a mobile app that can talk to your Google Cloud applications.

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,130
>> Talking of mobile apps, we're going to be launching

11
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:33,310
a course soon on how to build an Android application.

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,960
>> So make sure you look out for that one. But before we

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,900
leave you, just one final thing you have now seen what you can

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,060
do with App Engine today. Let's have Urs HÃ¶lzle a senior VP of

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,930
the infrastructure Google tell you about

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,170
the future of the Google Cloud platform.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,030
So we're back here with Urs. In this course, we learned a lot about App

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,170
Engine. Urs, what can we expect from Google

19
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,460
Cloud platform and app engine in the future?

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,819
>> A lot of innovation because what I'm really most excited about is that

21
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,900
we're just at the beginning of something that I think is going to be really big.

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,720
>> You know, we're proud of what we have today but what we're

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,260
really aiming for is getting to something that five years from now is

24
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,840
so much better.

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,630
>> I think the rate of innovation that we're going to see in NetCloud

26
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,770
is going to pick up and we hope to be a big part of that.

27
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,730
>> But our goal really is to take what we have and make it so much easier to

28
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,250
scale, so much easier to program, so much easier

29
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,360
to be on mobile, so much easier to analyze data.

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,090
>> And then really get a platform for you

31
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,860
that is everything that it is today but much

32
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,470
much better.

33
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,020
>> Really to the point where, if you remember what you thought was

34
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,290
great today, we really have a great product that you know five years from

35
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,860
now you'll kind of remember and say wow, you know, I'm kind of, I was

36
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,730
naive to think that this was great because if I look at today's product.

37
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,000
>> You know, was really just the beginning of it that's what I'm most excited

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,140
about. Do you have any final words to the students that have now learned a lot

39
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,810
about App Engine?

40
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,729
>> Now that you know App Engine, you're actually in a great

41
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,610
position to try out other parts of our platform and one of the

42
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,360
things that we're really going to work on is make it very easy

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,648
to combine App Engine with VM's or would be Query or with storage.

44
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:28,560
>> So that you can mix and match and implement your application not just in

45
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,250
pure app engine but really combine in with any other part that we have in our

46
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,720
infrastructure and still have it be very easy for you to both

47
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,950
write and run that's the path we're on and I hope you

48
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,700
enjoyed app engine and you'll enjoy the other parts even more. That's

49
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,990
right. We've barely started on this

50
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,290
great journey to build Google Cloud applications.

51
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,170
>> So keep your coding fingers up to date and stay

52
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,530
on top of what's possible in cloud computing because day by day

53
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,610
the Google Cloud platform gets better and better. So you can be sure that you'll

54
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:07,900
always. Build the best applications when you run them on Google Infrastructure.

55
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:14,684
See you. [NOISE]
