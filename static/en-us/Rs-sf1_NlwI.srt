If you've been with me so far, you know

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,514
that nucleus is providing only threads and IPC. It

3
00:00:06,514 --> 00:00:09,190
doesn't provide the abstraction of an address space. Because

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,670
this is implemented inside the kernel of the Spring

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,219
system. But, it is not what Spring calls as

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,810
X micro-kernel because nucleus that contains only the threads

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,740
and the IPC. Whereas Liedtke's description says you should

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,600
have all three in the microkernel, and in fact,

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,330
the Spring system does have it. It is just that in

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,150
the Spring system they name things

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,490
differently. They call nucleus their microkernel,

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,750
but the idea of a kernel in the Spring system contains

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,220
all three entities, even though the nucleus doesn't contain the address space.
