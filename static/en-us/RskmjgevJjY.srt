00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,780
Now as you can tell, Box2D is a fantastic library and the best part is it's

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,374
actually free use. And then we can go download it off the internet and put it

3
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:11,448
in our game. The author's only ask one thing though in their licensing. That

4
00:00:11,448 --> 00:00:15,815
you give them credit for using their work. Now back to GDC 2011, a very popular

5
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:21,247
mobile game developer who is actually using Box2D in their game. But actually

6
00:00:21,247 --> 00:00:25,417
forgot to credit the Box2D authors. This actually came to a head at GDC, when

7
00:00:25,417 --> 00:00:29,668
the very popular game makers were actually on stage during a panel. Some lonely

8
00:00:29,668 --> 00:00:32,951
representative actually stood up in the audience and asked them a question from

9
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:37,712
the crowd. Asking them what physics engineer are you using, to which they

10
00:00:37,712 --> 00:00:41,784
responded, Box2D. The individual then said hey, did you know that licensing

11
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:46,006
actually requires you to give attribution to them? They said didn't know that,

12
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:49,950
and he said cool. My name's Aaron Cotto, I wrote the library. Would you be

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,530
willing to give me credit? Of course, the person said let's talk afterwards.

14
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,258
The point is this, all that open-source software out there comes with some

15
00:00:57,258 --> 00:01:00,660
license. So before you actually go grab it, make sure that you read through

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,440
their licensing terms very, very carefully. And that you're abiding by their

17
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,384
using in a proper, legal way. Otherwise, you might get an angry Aaron Cotto

18
00:01:08,384 --> 00:01:10,410
showing up at your next GDC talk.
