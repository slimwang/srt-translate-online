In this exercise you'll finish adding a hand to the original robot. You'll see

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:07,076
in the initial code I've created one grabber for the hand by using the create

3
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:10,852
robot grabber function. It starts like this, with just this one piece of the

4
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:14,012
hand. Your goal is to create a hand that has two grabbers that slide along the

5
00:00:14,012 --> 00:00:17,977
cylinder and rotate together. I've provided sliders for both of these controls.

6
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:21,458
When you're done, the hand should look like this. The hand z control rotates it

7
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:25,510
as a whole. The hand spread slider opens and closes the hand. Note that for this

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,864
exercise you'll have to modify both the fill scene method and the render method.
