00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,120
So far, we have learned a lot of
different fun things to do with images.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,060
Now let's get to an even more
interesting topic, and that is how to do

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:13,600
similar kinds of things of both analysis
and synthesis, but apply to video.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,149
The simplest way of thinking
about it is, images over time,

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,760
a sequence of images forms a video.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,450
In this lesson, I'm going to
introduce a variety of methods or

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,710
representations that will let us do
the same kinds of things that we've done

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,330
with images, but the constraint of time
or sequence of time will be added to it.

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,700
But look at the representations and
actually start thinking about how we can

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,780
apply some of the things we have learned
in respect to images applied to video.
