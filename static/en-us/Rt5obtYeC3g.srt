1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Again, we start from the SIR equations.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now, we include initial conditions, namely that the initial number

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
of susceptible persons should be 98,900,000.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We want to have 100,000 infectious persons at the start and 1 million recovered persons at the start.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Your task is now to model that 5 million people are vaccinated at the beginning.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Here are four options of which you have to pick the right one.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
A--change the 5 to a 4 in both equations, B--subtract 100 persons per day from the S equation,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
C-- change these initial conditions to 93,900,000 persons and 6 million persons,

9
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
D--add 5 million persons per day to the R equation.
