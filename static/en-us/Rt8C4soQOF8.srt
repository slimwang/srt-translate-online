>> The equation should be y equals 5 x plus 10. If you got that right, excellent

algebraic thinking. We know we pay $10, that's our fixed cost, the registration

3
00:00:11,022 --> 00:00:16,458
fee. The 5 times x comes from the $5 per hour. We pay $5 per every hour we drive

4
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:21,976
the car. And, of course, if we add those two parts together we get y, our total

00:00:21,976 --> 00:00:22,411
cost.
