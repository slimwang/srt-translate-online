1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,000
UITableViews have two delegate
protocols, with a total of 44 methods.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,400
The two protocols
are the UITableViewDelegate,

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,080
which governs responses to user events,
and

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,780
the UITableViewDataSource, which enables
the table to access data in cells.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,940
So, think of the delegate as
being associated with events.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,360
And the data source is being associated
with data, appropriately enough.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,870
The table uses its delegate protocol
to ask event questions like these.

8
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,172
What should happen when
a button in a cell is tapped?

9
00:00:31,172 --> 00:00:34,110
What should be the response
to cell selection,

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,410
how should I respond when
a user begins editing a row?

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,200
What should happen when
a cell is deselected,

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,440
the table uses it's data source protocol
to ask data questions like these.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,010
How many rows do I have,
how many sections do I have?

14
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,640
What are the titles for the sections,
what is the cell view for each row?

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,900
Here I've opened the class reference for
the UITableViewDelegate.

16
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,600
Where you can find a complete
list of the protocols methods.

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,430
Many are related to managing sections,
like the ones we saw in the context and

18
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,760
settings apps.

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,320
Don't worry about those as much for

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,680
now, since we'll be focusing
on single section tables.

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,220
Visit the documentation on your own,
skim through the list.

22
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,360
And for each method,

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,600
think about the question that
the view is asking its delegate.

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,970
When you're done,
answer the quiz question.

25
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,760
Think of yourself as a table.

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,130
If you could only ask three
of these questions and

27
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,210
you needed to build a single section
table, which would you pick?
