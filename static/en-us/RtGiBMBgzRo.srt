00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
One cannot discuss anti-lock braking without asking whether or not

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
such an improved safety feature actually saves human lives.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Some researchers argue that humans tend to stick to a certain riskiness of the behavior.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The envelope of what can be considered risky behavior is pushed up

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
with introduction of anti-lock braking.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And many drivers are going to stay with the original level of riskiness, which means that

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
with the introduction of anti-lock braking systems, they are going to drive faster and brake harder

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
relying on the improved brakes.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In the end, it all boils down to saying that psychology matters.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
To improve safety, we cannot only look at technology or to cite an example from history--

11
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
when your ship is supposedly unsinkable, why should you care about icebergs?
