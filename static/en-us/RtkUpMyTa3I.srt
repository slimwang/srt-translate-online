00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,500
Notice that the two symbols to enclose the ranges of values listed down here are

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,883
square brackets and round parentheses, just like we see on our number line.

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:13,305
Since up here, we have a square bracket to include the negative 2 in our range,

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:17,583
and we have a round parentheses to not include the 6, we'll just match those

5
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:21,974
with either end of the interval that they belong to down here. So this is the

6
00:00:21,974 --> 00:00:22,953
correct answer.
