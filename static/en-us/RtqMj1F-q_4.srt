1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,905
The algorithm you've analyzed for
reductions and

2
00:00:02,905 --> 00:00:04,710
broadcasts is a tree-based scheme.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,160
You showed that it was
sub-optimal in the beta term.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,030
What that really means is that
it's a perfectly fine algorithm,

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,860
as long as the messages are small.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,450
But what if you care about
the case when n is very large?

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,210
After all,
if beta is much smaller than alpha,

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,020
then you can utilize a network bandwidth
better by sending larger messages.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,530
Let me turn this question around on you.

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,250
Why is the beta term so large?

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,890
That is, can you explain to
me intuitively in English,

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,950
what is the problem with the algorithm
that leads to this extra factor of log P

13
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,530
communication?

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,060
Type your explanation here.

15
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,070
Note that the question is somewhat open
ended so I'm not necessarily looking for

16
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,540
a fixed answer.

17
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,480
Well actually, I am looking for
a fixed answer, but

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,550
I want to see what you come up with.
