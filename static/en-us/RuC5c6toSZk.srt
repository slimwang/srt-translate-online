00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome to office hours for week 4.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I noticed that Units 3 and 4 were quite abstract.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Will the remaining units in the course be similarly abstract?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That is a good question.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Units 3 and 4 were relatively abstract--

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
to some degree, intentionally so.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We wanted to cover the basics of grammars, context-free grammars,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
how we might parse them ourselves--

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and we taught you a particular algorithm for that in class--

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and then how to interface with a tool that uses a similar algorithm

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and then given a context-free grammar and a description of how to build a parse tree

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
or an abstract syntax tree puts it all together.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That was difficult material.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And if you thought it seemed a little more abstract than the rest of the course,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
you are absolutely right.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And part of that is that we want to challenge you.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is a world-class education, and these are the sort of concepts that we would go into

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
at a top-tier university covering these topics.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We want to make sure that you understand languages from the inside out

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and thus that you can manipulate in your mind grammar rules--

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
the backbones, the essential syntactic constructs of languages.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We want you to know them, how to change them, how to implement them.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That said, the course really does go up and then go back down a bit

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
in terms of level of abstraction or difficulty.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
In Units 5 and 6, we're going to turn our attention to interpreting parse trees,

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
interpreting abstract syntax trees.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What comes next after a parser?

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, we try to figure out the meaning of a program.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We'll look at interpreting HTML, interpreting JavaScript,

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
as well as fun, off-to-the-side software engineering tasks like debugging programs

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and also optimizing them to make them go faster.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I think you'll find that Units 5 and 6 will be significantly more concrete and grounded

33
00:01:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
than Units 3 and 4 and possibly even a little easier.
