1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,040
The, the answer for this one is simple.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,020
If you look at it here, there is a gradient change.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,030
So, if I'm going up there,

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,050
all of a sudden there was a big change and then back to zero.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,140
This one, again, shows a negative.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,240
So, this one is A.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,790
B has a lot of noise.

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,200
But, it's not enough, and

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,930
you can actually kind of see a replica of this thing, except with a lotta noise.

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,930
There is signal, there's a little bit of hump, end coming up,

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,170
and there's a little bit of hump coming down.

12
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,970
So, while there is significant noise here, it's not enough, and

13
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,860
you can most probably detect it, but it's going to be hard.

14
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,770
But if I really increase the 0.25, all of a sudden you notice,

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,380
there is just no information here that allowed me to kind of look for

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,530
a sudden gradient change, which is where, perhaps, an edge would be.
