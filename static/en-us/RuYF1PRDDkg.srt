1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:09,070
Earlier, we rewrote Grant's balance after one year as 10,000 times 1 plus 0.03.

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,760
Here, we can clearly see those two quantities we were just talking about. The

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:22,494
principle 10,000 right here, and the interest rate, 0.03 right here. So, what

4
00:00:22,494 --> 00:00:25,718
would happen if we kept our expressions in this form, but found the balance

5
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:31,087
after year two? First things first, though, let's remember how we found this

6
00:00:31,087 --> 00:00:37,763
quantity here. We took the principle, and then, since this is the amount of

7
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:41,582
money in the account at the start of this year, we multiplied it by the

8
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:48,764
interest rate. That's how we got this quantity. Now, we know that to find this

9
00:00:48,764 --> 00:00:51,708
balance after two years, we're going to need to start with the amount of money

10
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:54,652
that's in the account at the beginning of year 2, which is this quantity right

11
00:00:54,652 --> 00:01:00,729
here. So, this amount is going to sneak around and end up as our starting

12
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:05,750
point. Now, I'm about to give you a bunch of boxes to fill in, but please don't

13
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,755
be overwhelmed. You're very well-prepared to do what I'm about ask you to do.

14
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:16,624
It's not a big deal. What I would like you to do is to substitute into these

15
00:01:16,624 --> 00:01:22,545
green boxes a certain quantity. And I'll give you a hint, the same quantity

16
00:01:22,545 --> 00:01:27,120
belongs in each of these boxes. Think using this equation right here what

17
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:34,220
quantity that is. Then, based on what you end up with right here, I'd like you

18
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:41,019
to write this in a more compact form right here. However, keep 1 plus 0.03

19
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:46,023
written as is. Don't change it to 1.03.
