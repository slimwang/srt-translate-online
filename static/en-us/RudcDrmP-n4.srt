1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now we're ready to define what a perfect cipher is

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and to see why the one-time pad satisfies this property.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The notion that we want a perfect cipher to mean

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
is that if an attacker intercepts a message they receive the cipher text

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that provides them with no additional information at all about what the plain text was.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We have a message. It's being encrypted with a key.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The attacker is intercepting that cipher text as it's sent over the insecure channel.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What we want to know is that an attacker who sees just the cipher text

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
learns nothing about the message.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you followed the definition of conditional probability,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
you should be able to decide how to define that formally.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We'll make that a quiz.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The question is which of these is the property that we want in order for a cipher to be perfect?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That is, to have this property that the cipher text reveals no information about the plain text.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to introduce some notation.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Our message is selected from the set of all possible messages.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We have some other message we'll call m*, also selected from M.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We don't know if M is equal to m*.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Both of these we could think of being drawn from the set of messages.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We have some key drawn from the set of possible keys.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
For this quiz your goal is to understand how we can formally define what a perfect cipher is.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is the scenario: we have an attacker whose heard of cipher text.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We want to know that by hearing just the cipher text the attacker has learned

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
nothing new about the message.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We've introduced some notation here.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We have a set of possible messages--the uppercase M.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We can select lowercase message m*. Those are both messages selected from M.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The attacker's goal would be to tell is the intercepted cipher text the same as message m*.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's the attacker's guess.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We have encryption using some key selected from the set of all possible keys.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We don't know what the key is. Here are the possible choices.
