00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,510
The Andrew File System was a bold new experiment in the CS department at CMU.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:12,090
The intent was to enable students across campus, to be able to walk up to any

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,900
workstation on campus, and start using it. All

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,100
the files stored in a central server on

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,190
the local area network. Will be accessible in

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,310
a safe and secure manner from that workstation.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,220
The assumption is that the network itself is untrusted. In this lesson we will

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,360
use, the Andrews system as a case study to see how Private key

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,840
cryptographic infrastructure can be used for the

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,920
security and authentication of such a system.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,730
The focus in this lesson is a distributed file system being made available to

12
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:56,750
a user community. And the year is circa 1988, and the state

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,630
of the computing at that time looked as follows. Local area network

14
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,540
and client workstations connecting the servers and the local disk on the

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,560
workstation serve as efficient caches of

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,120
files that maybe downloaded from the server.
