1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,320
Of course, the correct answer here is 8 bits.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,710
And the way to think through this in the binary world is 2 raised to the n,

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,906
where n is equal to 8.

4
00:00:09,906 --> 00:00:13,450
Would give you a value of 256,

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,970
which basically will allow us to have values from 0 to 255.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,350
Different types of images do have different ways or different number of bytes or

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,900
bits of information we would use.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,550
We could actually imagine a binary image

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,590
which bit allow only basically looking at values of 0's and 1's, and

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,850
that would be a binary image or a black and white image.

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,110
Of course, we can imagine also having images 2 raised to the 24,

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,230
where a lot more information is stored beyond just 0 to 255,

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,470
and I"ll actually be showing an example of that a little later.
