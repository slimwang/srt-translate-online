1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,230
Okay, so at this point we have
designed the experiments and now what?

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,039
And now it actually becomes easy.

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:10,510
Now that you have the experiments, you
need to run the test cases a number of

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,200
times using the [INAUDIBLE] ranges
of the experimental factors.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,060
Compute the metrics,
the averages over of those n times and

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,020
then represent the results.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,820
When it comes to representing
the results, I'm not going to go

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,330
into further discussion in terms of
best practices and how to do that.

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,410
But just keep in mind that the visual
representation can really help

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,010
strengthen your arguments.

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,300
And there are a lot of papers that will
be discussed during this course that use

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,840
different techniques on
how to represent results.

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,300
So you can draw some ideas from there.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,618
Or there are other
documentations online,

15
00:00:46,618 --> 00:00:49,564
there are also courses that
are taught at Georgia Tech or

16
00:00:49,564 --> 00:00:53,779
also in the Audacity's platform that
talk about information visualization.

17
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:56,729
So you can benefit from such
content in terms of how

18
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:59,555
to really visualize your results.

19
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:02,205
And make sure that you don't
just show the results.

20
00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:06,965
Actually make a conclusion, spell out
what is it that these experimental

21
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:10,975
results support as far as
your claims are concerned.
