1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:05,680
Partnerships are a great way to maximize
or initiate distribution of your app.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,550
Partnerships can be mutually
beneficial for many companies and

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,640
can be cost effective when
you're just starting out.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,450
When thinking about potential partners,
you need to think about touch points,

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,340
which are the methods you use
to connect with your customers.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,020
So is it a face to face meeting,
is it through online ads, or

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,720
is it through a partnership?

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,090
You'll need to figure out
the lifestyle of your customer.

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,270
And when they need to solve a problem,
you have the solution for it.

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,920
For Embarkment,
our customers will be looking for

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,280
a solution to their dog sitting
needs when they are going to travel.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,640
Let's think about the behavior of a
person that goes on vacation, and where

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,130
we might find an opportunity to connect
with them, when they need us most.

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,030
This person might book his
flight online, maybe search for

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,840
a hotel or AirBnB in his destination,
and perhaps also rent a car.

16
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,230
>> For example, we could consider
partnering with a travel agency to be

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,660
their preferred dogsitting service.

18
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,460
When booking with a travel agency,
you'll have add-on options,

19
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,040
like renting a car, booking a hotel,
flights, getting travel insurance, and

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,570
now we'll pitch them adding dogsitting.

21
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,700
Now we need to consider why somebody
else would want to partner with us.

22
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,600
In this case, we would be great for
a travel agency

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,700
because they're now able to offer
a more holistic booking experience and

24
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,740
being the one stop shop for
their customers.

25
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:19,720
>> More than that,

26
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,840
these players are usually basing
their model on affiliate networks.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,770
So, they get a fee for each click or

28
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,260
conversion coming from
their site to ours.

29
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,000
For us, it's great because they're
putting us in front of people who

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,330
are planning to travel, and

31
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,250
we will be paying them only for
a successful outcome.

32
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,420
Either leads, which are clicks.

33
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,080
Or customers, so conversions.

34
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,240
It's a mutually beneficial relationship.

35
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,510
>> Take YouTube, for example.

36
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,090
When they were just starting out they
sought a partnership with Myspace

37
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,520
to host their videos, and
look where YouTube is now.

38
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,660
You're actually watching
a YouTube hosted video right now.

39
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,004
On that note, let's hear from
Steve Chen, a YouTube co-founder.
