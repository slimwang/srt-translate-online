1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And my answer is quite simple--again, it runs my experiment a 1000 times using the for x in range

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
it summons a new list and this on the list is the mean of the list produced by flip.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Flip itself every single time I run it will give me a 1000 0s or 1s or truths or false

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and using the function mean, I compute the mean of that.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But now I have an outer loop where I do this calculation of the mean a 1000 times.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It summed them into a new list and that's my new list and that list is continuous valued.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
These are printed out by saying print outcomes after generating it.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What I see is a list of 1000 numbers--it all have around some by 0.5,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
some of it is 0.046, some is 0.515.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
These are the empirical means for these sequences of a 1000 coin flips.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
See how it flip effectively 1,000,000 coins here, and this is the corresponding histogram

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
plotting the frequency of the coins.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
[#000000]
