1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,410
One common way that developers go from a
starting concept to a polished final app

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,230
is to have a visual model
in mind as they go.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,820
To create a cohesive design for
your app, it's a good idea to draw out

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,120
a model of what you want
your final app to look like.

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,699
In fact, it's often the job of
a designer to create these models,

6
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:21,089
which are referred to as mock ups.

7
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:25,719
A mock up is a model of an Android app
that's used for design evaluation.

8
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:28,939
It's usually a picture or
animation of the final app.

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,274
And detailed mock ups include
specific colors to use, and

10
00:00:32,274 --> 00:00:34,244
markings called keylines.

11
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:37,524
Keylines are used to
specify the exact size and

12
00:00:37,524 --> 00:00:40,664
spacing for components in an app layout.

13
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:43,854
Then, for every detail that's
provided in a mock up,

14
00:00:43,854 --> 00:00:47,951
it's your job as a developer to
implement that in the app code.

15
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:52,121
You might be wondering how a designer
makes these decisions about layout and

16
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:54,042
which colors and fonts to use.

17
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:58,329
And in general, they follow something
called material design guidelines.

18
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:02,039
Material design for Android is
a set of principles and guides for

19
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,659
creating useful and beautiful visuals
and interaction across platforms and

20
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:07,804
devices.

21
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:10,700
And next, we'll go over these
guidelines for choosing color and

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,710
fonts that work best for you app.
