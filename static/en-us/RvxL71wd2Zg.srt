1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] The answer is 0.2,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and this follows directly from Bayes' rule.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In this formula, we can read off the first 2 values straight from the table over here,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and we expand the denominator by total probability.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Observing that this is exactly the same expression as up here,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
we get 0.1 divided by 0.1 plus this expression over here can be copied from over here,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and P of not A is directly obtained up here.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Hence we get 0.5 over here, and as a result we get 0.2.
