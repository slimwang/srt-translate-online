00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,545
Since our point estimates are based on our samples, our point estimate for the

2
00:00:05,545 --> 00:00:12,360
difference will be 5.08 minus 7.8 which is negative 2.72. But we still want to

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,260
know how this compares to other differences. And so we need to find the

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,683
standard error of the differences.
