00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,830
Welcome to lesson two. In the last lesson, you created

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,270
an app that tracked the very basic elements in a

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,500
music festival. Before we talk about what we're going to learn

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,140
in this lesson, you're going to hang out with Samantha and

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,420
Andy in a real music festival, and get a better

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,210
idea what exactly what your app needs to do. There

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,100
were just so many things going on, I mean obviously

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,870
there are the bands, and the stages, and the attendees.

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,870
>> And lots of stuff.

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,520
Food, drink vendors, but there were some unexpected things too.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,820
>> I really liked the view from the Ferris Wheel. That was pretty cool.

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,720
>> Definitely, and then the silent disco is awesome.

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,690
>> Oh my goodness taking off those headphones, and

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,600
then not being able to hear the music anymore.

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,850
>> Yeah. That was like trippy.

16
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,750
>> Very surreal.

17
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,870
>> The bubble guy.

18
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,950
>> That was super cool, and the alien parade.

19
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,270
>> There are those ladies on stilts who you refused to dance with.

20
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,630
>> Look, I don't have as much rhythm as you okay, Andy?

21
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,880
>> Alright, so it's safe to

22
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,740
say there's a lot going on, but despite all

23
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,140
the chaos, the festival overall was pretty well organized.

24
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,330
>> And yeah, we were able to find our way around the festival to make it

25
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,440
to the right stages at the right times, and see the bands we wanted to see.
