1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,734
We still have to do the same things
we had before, so you remember, in,

2
00:00:03,734 --> 00:00:06,630
in tracking,when we were doing
tracking we had this notion of

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,260
a dynamics model for and
it was a linear model.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,200
So the idea is that at each time step,
we have some prediction that,

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,610
allow, us say, well, if I have some
density about where I think I am,

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,920
what's my new density?

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,010
And in that particular case,

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,970
it had to be linear in order
to make the math work out.

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,302
That was, you know,
the underlying part of the, the Kalman.

10
00:00:29,302 --> 00:00:31,380
All right but in general,

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,530
we can have a more general
state transition matrix, right?

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,150
So the idea is that what is the expected
change from time T to T plus one.

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,760
Okay so if I'm at some point or

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,200
if I'm guessing that I'm at some point
I can say what's my expected change.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,980
So what's important about this and the
reason I'm going on and on about this is

16
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,180
besides just having a sort of dynamics
model that says how things are likely to

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:02,040
evolve I can also intru, include
a notion of perturbation or control.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,400
All right.

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,700
So, the perturbation means if I was
here, maybe I know that I added,

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,290
I took two steps to the right.

21
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,640
Now Megan's freaking out again.

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,400
All right, I'm back.

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,170
All right.

24
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,387
So what I would do is
I would say that okay,

25
00:01:17,387 --> 00:01:22,200
the the expected state
transition is that

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,250
I take where I am, I take two steps to
the right, and then I add some noise.

27
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,300
So it's a little bit like, remember when
we talked about that in a linear model

28
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,930
I could actually have a different
linear transition at every time t,

29
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,820
but usually we keep them constant,
here, we're going to have the notion

30
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,120
of an input, and the input is
represented as u, u for input.

31
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,470
Don't ask me.

32
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,200
You, if you, if you want to know why,
ask some control theory professor,

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,950
because they always use u as the input,
so it's their desire.

34
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,090
Anyway, so we're going to see a u sub t.

35
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,220
That's the control, or the input,
or the perturbation that got added

36
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,730
to the system at time T and
we assume that we know that, alright?

37
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,770
So what we've done is we've changed
our filtering just a little bit so

38
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,014
that besides just taking observations,
we're going to assume we have

39
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:15,260
observations plus assume, that we have,
we know what the inputs are, all right?

40
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,990
Lots of words but
I hope that you follow that.
