1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Well, this is a lot of boxes to check for one quiz

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but I don't think it's that hard to think about so let's go through this.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In a clique, each node is connected to each of the other nodes.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So the degree is linear in the number of nodes but think about path links.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Every node is connected to every other node.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So the path you can always get directly from one node to any other node.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
A very, very small world but it's a small world because everybody knows everybody.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And we know that that's not what our world is like.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now if you go to a small private school you may have exhibit exactly this kind of effect.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
All right, next let's think about a ring. What happens in a ring?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, the degree in a ring is always 2. All the nodes have a degree of 2.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So it's a constant degree, but what about a path link? What's the longest path link in a ring?

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, some of the nodes are really nearby but some of them you have to go all the way

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
to the other side to get to them and that could be as big as the number of nodes N

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
divided by 2 because it's the opposite side.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
After you get further and further and further, you start to get closer again.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So the path link is actually linear in this case. Balanced tree is really interesting.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So the degree here, well a node might have a parent and two children.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is a balanced binary tree in particular.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The root node has a degree of 2 and all the leaves have a degree of 1, so it's never more than 3.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No matter how many nodes were in the graphs so the degree is constant.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But let's look at the path link.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Any node can get to any other node by going up to the root

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and then back down to the other node you want to get to.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Getting up to the root takes logarithmically not many steps.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And then going back down also takes logarithmically not many steps.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So it's like two log n but that's actually a pretty short path for a big graph.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's not that many hops you have to make to get to where you're going.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
All right finally let's look at our friend the hypercube.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
In a hypercube, each node is numbered with log n bits and it's connected to all the other

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
nodes in the network that have names that differ by at most one bit.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There's at most logarithmically many of those.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So each node in the hypercube is connected to log n and other nodes.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The degree is a big data of log n.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now what about path link. If I want to get from one node to any other node, what do I need to do?

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So we didn't talk about this before but it's actually kind of neat.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So let's imagine we want to get from some node and here's its label 010

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
to some other node and here's its label 111.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We know in one hop we can go from 010 to 110.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And then in one more hop we can go from 110 to 111.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
In fact, to go from any node in the hypercube to any other node in the hypercube,

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
all you have to do is go through the bit positions one at a time and to reverse

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
the corresponding edge if the source and the target differ in that bit position.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So in at most log n hops we can go from any position in this hypercube to any other position.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So again pretty short paths.
