1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,980
For completeness we'll go ahead and

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,570
explore duality in the context of
a maximum flow problem as well.

3
00:00:06,685 --> 00:00:11,990
We can cast it as a linear programming
by letting fuv be the flow, and

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,900
letting cuv be the capacity
along an edge u,v.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,350
Our goal is to maximize
the flow out of the source

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:25,520
subject to the conservation of flow
constraint and the capacity constraints.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,780
And of course flows must
be non negative as well.

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,930
To express the dual, we'll use Yu for

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:37,690
the conservation constraints and
Yuv for the capacity constraints.

10
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,270
Two subscripts mean
a capacity constraint,

11
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,340
one subscript means
a conservation constraint.

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:50,450
The dual problem is to minimize the sum
over all the edges of Yuv times Cuv.

13
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,340
Note that the Yus have no role
in the objection function

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,770
because their coefficients are 0.

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,774
The constraints for
the dual involve several cases.

16
00:00:58,774 --> 00:01:04,800
We'll consider first those arising from
the objective function coefficients for

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,770
edges out of the source being 1.

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,090
These flows appear once in
the capacity constraints, and

19
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,950
once for the receiving vertex for
the flow in their conservation equation.

20
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,830
The case for
edges going into the sync is analogous.

21
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,230
The flow is present in
the capacity constraints and

22
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:31,220
in the conservation of flow
constraint for the sending vertex.

23
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,170
For all other edges the flow
appears in the capacity constraint.

24
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,640
And in the conservation equations for
both the sending and

25
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,450
the receiving vertex.

26
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,190
And of course these dual
variables have to be non-negative.

27
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,660
The interpretation of these dual
variables can be a little tricky, so

28
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:55,130
I'm going to rearrange them to isolate
the two indexed variables, the ones

29
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,690
corresponding to edges and the ones
that appear in the objective function.

30
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,280
On the left hand side.

31
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,380
This makes it a little easier
to see what's going on.

32
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,440
Actually, I think this
would make a good exercise.
