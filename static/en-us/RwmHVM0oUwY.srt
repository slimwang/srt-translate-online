00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,490
Okay, so now you're well on your
way to use ads in your app.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,990
And the time has come to implement,
an interstitial ad.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,680
So to implement the interstitial,
here's what we'll do.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,690
We will implement the interstitial
activity that will contain two buttons

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,490
for the initial text, Load Interstitial
and Interstitial Not Ready.

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,090
The Load Interstitial button
will have a call back method

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,615
called loadInterstitial.

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,740
When this method is called,
we will disable the button and

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,440
then change the takes to
Loading Interstitial.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,830
The other button will have
a property in interstitial activity

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,020
called mShowButton.

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,010
It's callback method
will be showInterstitial.

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,670
And for the first part of this we
will leave that implementation empty.

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,540
As you can see, when the activity
is loaded, this button is disabled.

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,200
Therefore, we will set it
to disabled in onCreate.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,190
And finally for this first step,
we will create a string

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,660
resource called interstitial_ad_unit_id.

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,900
This string resource we will
set to the following value.

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:09,940
And as you may have guessed, this is the
test ad unit ID for interstitial ads.

20
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,550
So let's look in more detail how
these things are implemented.
