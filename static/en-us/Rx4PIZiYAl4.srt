00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,780
When writing code in many languages,

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,560
it's common to have features that span multiple files.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,950
Let's say you have a function that currently takes one argument defined in

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,860
one file and a call to this function in another file.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,800
If you want to change this function to take an additional argument,

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,280
you'll need to simultaneously change code in both files.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,870
In many of the non-code oriented version control systems we

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,720
mentioned previously, files are tracked one at a time.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,340
If I open two Google docs and edit both of them,

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,220
then later I want to find the versions of the files before I made either of

11
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,120
the edits, first I have to find the right version in one doc, then dig through

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,660
the other one's log to find the revision for approximately the same time.

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,510
That's doable, but really annoying.

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,020
Let's consider a few situations to

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,700
think about whether tracking files individually or together makes more sense.

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,200
For example, competition-style coding.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,120
In case you're not familiar with them, most coding competitions just ask you

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,170
to solve a problem that can be done in a single file.

19
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,950
Another example would be an HTML file and

20
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,080
a CSS file that together make up a web page.

21
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,450
Or maybe some photos you've Photoshopped.

22
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,110
Or a novel, split up into multiple chapters.

23
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,370
For each of these situations,

24
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,170
if you think it makes more sense to track the files together rather than

25
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,090
separately, check the box next to it.
