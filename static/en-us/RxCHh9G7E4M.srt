1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,640
In a general sense,
the purpose of a company or

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,930
other organization is to create value.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,590
That value can be physical or
digital, intellectual or social, but

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,640
most companies or organizations
are not made with an idea of hey,

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,280
I want to invest a lot of money and
waste a lot of employees'

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,649
time to make something that is
completely useless and worthless.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,330
To create value, first you need
an idea for a product or service but

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,820
having an idea isn't nearly enough.

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,810
Customers don't pay for just ideas.

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,670
They want to see something that does
what they need, a functioning product,

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,270
a working service.

12
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,550
An idea that you don't actually
ship is nothing but vapor water.

13
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,480
There are often a lot of people involved
in taking a product or even just

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,800
one feature from idea to delivery and
these people have to communicate.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,470
They have to pass the product to be
from one person or team to another for

16
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,210
design implementation,
testing and delivery.

17
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,850
And, in the software business,
organizations doing these things have

18
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,670
often fallen into a particular
pattern or anti-pattern.

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,250
It's a pattern that can
really get in the way.

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,160
This classic organizational structure
has strict borders between development,

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,170
quality assurance,

22
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,010
operations and other groups involved
in delivering a product to the user.

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,800
One team finishes their part then passes
the product in it's current shape to

24
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,740
the next department for
the next step and

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,090
no matter how efficient the process
within single departments,

26
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,010
if there are high walls in between them
problems and inefficiencies creep in.

27
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,360
All too often, there's not a lot of
communication between departments and

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,230
the attitude might be, throw it over
the wall it's not our problem anymore,

29
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,790
we met our deadline.

30
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,040
And if the customer at the end
throws the product back saying,

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,170
this is not what I wanted,
then a nasty cycle of blame can start.

32
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,880
This kind of organization can
have a lot of different problems.

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,720
It tends to be slow and
ineffective at delivery.

34
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,160
It can't learn from failures because
people are blaming one another.

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,050
It's hard to make changes especially
large and sweeping changes.

36
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,350
Operational problems tend to
stack up and become worse and

37
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,510
everybody involved is pretty unhappy.

38
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,320
These were challenges that a lot of
organizations faced, especially as teams

39
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,090
and the services they ran got larger,
it got harder for them to work together.

40
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,090
Developers and operations teams, both
technical functions in the company, but

41
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,169
with different interests and

42
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,550
cultures, seemed to be
particularly badly affected.

43
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,270
In 2009, a grassroots movement of
practitioners started that became what

44
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,120
is now known as DevOps.

45
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,060
This movement is experience-based,
decentralized and open to all, but

46
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,620
it has gained a lot of traction
in both the open-source world and

47
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,560
in big-enterprise companies and

48
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,810
as the problems its solves are becoming
more and more apparent in more and

49
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,170
more companies, so
is the adoption of DevOps growing.

50
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,820
But what exactly is DevOps and
how does it help?
