00:00:00,136 --> 00:00:05,175
Here's a code snippet that specifically shows the data movement calls, these cudaMemcpy calls.

2
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:08,545
What I'd like you to do is fill in the question marks here.

3
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:12,312
Your choices are going to be cudaMemcpy host to device,

4
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:16,425
cudaMemcpy device to host, or cudaMemcpy device to device.
