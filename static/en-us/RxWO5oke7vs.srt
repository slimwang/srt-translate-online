We haven't really used graphs to help us solve inequalities but it is possible.

2
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:09,169
Thinking about how we could graphically solve equations which of these graphs do

3
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:13,456
you think will help us show the inequality x squared is greater than 16. And

4
00:00:13,456 --> 00:00:17,810
which one do you think will help us show x squared minus 16 is greater than 0?

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,692
Fill in either a or b in each box.
