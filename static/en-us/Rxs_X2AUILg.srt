1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,270
Now, look at your page and compare it to the design mock and

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,920
make sure that you go deeper than just a simple visual check.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,180
See if the defining parts are correct.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,780
The layout, margins, fonts, colors, etc.

5
00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:16,791
For example,

6
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:22,190
does the image in the mock up look different than the image on your page?

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,260
In comparing the two,

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,810
you can see that there's actually a space here and we dont' have a space here.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,970
You can use Dev Tools to find the proper value of the margin for

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,980
the image class.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,600
Once you've refined it in Dev Tools, you can then save it to your CSS file.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,860
You can look to the design mock to find this information.

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,410
The background and color for the title is also incorrect.

14
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,100
Now, often these colors are provided within the design document and

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,390
you can see these small boxes on the left-hand side and

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,290
the color in a hex code is defined there.

17
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,660
But you can also use different color-picker tools to get the same information.

18
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,110
As you refine the design, answer the following questions, first,

19
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,820
what margin size gets the design closer to the mock?

20
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,590
Also, what is the background color for the header?
