1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,020
So here is one possible solution.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,320
We have the filterPlayground method,
which is exposed to the API

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,350
with the request type of VoidMessage,
response type of ConferenceForms.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,570
Starts out by building an empty query,
then filters the query by city equals

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,310
London, then by Conference.topics
equals Medical Innovations.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,820
Let's just sort it by conference name,

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,540
because that makes it
a little bit neater.

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,040
And then return,
the ConferenceForms object,

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,330
which is a copy of each
conference returned by the query.
