1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,800
We have now explored the data set and drawn a few histograms.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,810
This particular quiz is not graded.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,650
But please do follow the exercise along.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,900
Use what your learned in lesson two about the irreducible variance to treat

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,610
the average values of the three variables as random variables and

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,300
the standard deviation as the irreducible variance int he data.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,150
So write code to do the following.

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:33,540
First, draw histogram of f naught of the charged amounts.

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,428
Then in the same plot, make another histogram of f

10
00:00:39,428 --> 00:00:43,550
naught plus 1 times the standard deviation of f naught,

11
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,290
which is another variable given in your data.

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,833
In the same plot again,

13
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:54,830
draw a histogram of f naught minus 1 times the standard deviation of f naught.

14
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,080
You should see something like a histogram with a error band.

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,010
Once you are done with that, click on the box here.
