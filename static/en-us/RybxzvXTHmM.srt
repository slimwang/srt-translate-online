1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:01,550
Policy shaping.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:02,540
>> Policy shaping.

3
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,689
>> Did you make up that word because
I'm not sure I understand what that

4
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:05,840
word means.

5
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,770
>> So I did not make up the word policy
and I did not make up the word shaping.

6
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:10,562
>> No I know that.

7
00:00:10,562 --> 00:00:15,040
[LAUGH] No, I'm sorry that
the combination of those two words.

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,010
>> Well I'm not going to say I
made it up although maybe I did,

9
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,970
one of the papers that we're
going to read is actually a paper

10
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,230
that I was a part of the author team on.

11
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,970
And it's all about introducing
the notion of policy shaping.

12
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,958
And it's really a very simple idea,
it's sort of what I just described, that

13
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,786
what human beings are actually doing
is giving you direct policy advice.

14
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:37,298
And so they're trying to shape what
the policy should be directly,

15
00:00:37,298 --> 00:00:42,680
as opposed to trying to say something
about what rewards ought to be.

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,600
Does that make sense?

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,120
>> Yeah I think so.

18
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,590
I mean I guess now, before I was
thinking about shaping differently.

19
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,110
But now it's sort of feeling
like sculpting to me,

20
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,470
like you have a policy out there and
you're going to apply pressure and

21
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,700
smoothing in different places to
have it be a little bit different.

22
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,720
>> Right, so think about it this way.

23
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,350
There's actually I think
a direct way of doing this.

24
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,010
When you do policy shaping,
what have you actually done?

25
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,954
What you've actually done is you've
taken whatever the reward function was

26
00:01:06,954 --> 00:01:11,250
in say some particular state or
some particular action and

27
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,020
let's say was zero.

28
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,550
And what you said is no, this is
the wrong answer, the wrong value,

29
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,020
it should not be zero here.

30
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,940
It should actually be something else,
it should be, well I don't know,

31
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,590
three so you've actually replace
the original reward function

32
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,370
R with another reward function R prime
instead this is actually the reward

33
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,130
function that you should
be learning over.

34
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,620
And that's really what reward
shaping does for you, right?

35
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,250
I mean, if you think back to the
examples that you were giving with all

36
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,530
the reward shaping, you were
replacing reward values, agreed?

37
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,920
>> Yeah, though in the case where we
were doing potential base shaping,

38
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,130
we also had to make sure that whenever
we sprinkled some positive reward in,

39
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,380
there was negative reward someplace
else to balance it out, so

40
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,080
you didn't get new positive
reward cycles happening.

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,870
>> Right now that's true but regardless
of where you sprinkle them and

42
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,630
what kind of constraints you put up you
still took what was originally a reward

43
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,580
value of something like zero and
replaced it with another reward value

44
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,080
>> I agree with that.

45
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,020
>> Plus three, minus three,
seven, doesn't matter.

46
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,810
So you change the reward function.

47
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,860
So in exactly the same way policy
shaping is about changing the policy.

48
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,420
There's some policy that
the agent currently has and

49
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,830
you're saying actually in this state,
rather than whatever it was you

50
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,740
think you should do,
you should do in fact this.

51
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,140
So maybe I'm confirming what you already
had, maybe I'm telling you to do

52
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,690
something different, but regardless
I'm overriding your policy function.

53
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,340
In the same way that in reward shaping
you're overriding the reward function.

54
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,440
>> Okay, that makes sense.

55
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,740
>> Right, so this is what
policy shaping is all about and

56
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,360
it happens to line up with,
it turns out in practice,

57
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,910
the way people are actually
trying to convey information.

58
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,830
And so then the real question is,
what do you do with this?

59
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,080
How do I take this information
that's being given,

60
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,130
if it's not being given in the form of
rewards, we know how to do that, but

61
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,300
it's actually being given
in the form of a policy.

62
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,220
What should I actually do about it?

63
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,340
>> So I was interpreting what
you described as saying,

64
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,470
if a person gives positive feedback for
an action in a state and it's not

65
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,050
the action that the agent would have
taken that state, then just replace it.

66
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,300
Just make a modification of the policy
so that, that's the action that's taken.

67
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,520
Is that the way to do it?

68
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,230
>> Well, ideally that is
what you would do, right?

69
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,270
If a person tells you, look,
you should go up here, or

70
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,150
you should eat a ghost here,
you should just do it.

71
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,240
But that actually requires something be
true, which as the lawyers would say,

72
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,980
assumes facts not in evidence.

73
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,530
And that is,
that the person's actually right.

74
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,580
What if the person's wrong?

75
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,570
>> Yeah, but certainly we should at
least have that as our assumption.

76
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,140
I mean, if we don't think the person
is right then this is a really

77
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,550
easy thing to do policy keeping.

78
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,880
Just ignore the person.

79
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,160
>> But what if the person is
right most of the time, but

80
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,630
can occasionally be wrong?

81
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,690
>> I see.
>> But what if the person's right but

82
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,430
actually meant to say at
the time step before?

83
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,680
>> I see, so maybe there's a way to
use all these different things as

84
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,330
evidence and
then to combine them together to get,

85
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,640
I don't know kind of a best guess
as to what the right answer is.

86
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,630
>> Exactly and that's why it's
policy shaping and not policy doing.

87
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,910
So I'm going to try to give you a little
quiz and see if we can kind of work out

88
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,610
what the right thing to do is under
the circumstances, where a person

89
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,210
might tell you to do something and
might not always be right about it.

90
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:13,920
Seem fair?

91
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,420
>> Yeah.
