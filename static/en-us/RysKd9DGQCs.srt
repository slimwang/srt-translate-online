00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,890
One further nuance to mention about associations, is the idea of links.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,791
Just like classes can have instances, associations can have links. For

3
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:17,746
example, if we had the situation where a company hires people,

4
00:00:17,746 --> 00:00:24,676
we might have a situation where IBM hires Bob. IBM hires Alice.

5
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:32,900
Hewlett-Packard hires Tom. Hewlett-Packard hires Alice.

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,450
She has two, two jobs. In this situation, we would have four different links.

7
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:43,800
One for each pair involved in the association. Notice in this particular

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,970
diagram that in addition to indicating all of the particular instances

9
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:55,730
of the classes, that the lines here are going to indicate links.

10
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,830
That is lines between rectangles for

11
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:05,379
which the rectangles are instances indicate links, that participate

12
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,180
in association. Notice also that we have role names here and we have qualifiers.
