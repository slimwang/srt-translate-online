1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:05,056
For the CarShareApp, we crated four classes. There was the CarShareApp, which

2
00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:10,693
used the simulation, which used cars and persons. The simulation and car

3
00:00:10,693 --> 00:00:16,180
classes go together and are specific to the CarShareApp. The person is more

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,970
general and could possibly be used for other situations. These three classes

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,810
could be organized into packages. The person class might go into a more

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,866
general, com.udacity package, and the simulation and car, would go in a more

7
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:36,280
specific, carshare package. The CarShareApp, is just a main program, that we're

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,456
writing that uses these other things, so we'll keep it in the default package.

9
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:44,506
Creating packages in BlueJ is a little bit funny, so I'll show you how to do

10
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:50,094
this. From the car share project. I'm going to look up at the menu. It's at the

11
00:00:50,094 --> 00:00:55,186
upper left for me, but it might be right along this bar for you. I'll go to

12
00:00:55,186 --> 00:01:01,391
Edit> New Package, and then put in the package name. Com.udacity.carshare. Now

13
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:08,730
the package appears here in Bluejay. I can open it up. This is the com package.

14
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,020
This is the Udacity package and this is the Car-share package in the Car-share

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,681
package I want to put the car in simulation classes. So to do that i will go to

16
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:22,776
that Edit menu again and then I select Add Classroom file and then inside the

17
00:01:22,776 --> 00:01:29,355
folder that contains all of the Car-share I'll select the car and add it. Now

18
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:33,427
the car shows up in the Car-share package. But I need to add the simulation

19
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:40,375
too. Edit > Add Classroom File > Simulation > Add. Now in the Udacity package I

20
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:45,792
want to add the person. Edit > Add Classroom File and this time I'll select

21
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:51,036
Person. And now its here, so this compiles but if I go back to the Car-share

22
00:01:51,036 --> 00:01:57,062
package and try to compile these or find cannot find symbol class. That's

23
00:01:57,062 --> 00:02:01,271
because person is no longer right beside simulation so i have to tell Java

24
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:07,474
where to look for the person class. Where do I look for the person class? In

25
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:13,580
com.udacity. Now before I ask you a question, I've got one more clean up task.

26
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,930
Right now there are actually two persons. There's one in com Udacity, and

27
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,495
there's one in Car-share seven. So, all of the classes that I copied into

28
00:02:21,495 --> 00:02:26,247
different packages, I need to remove. So I'll remove car, and it's okay that

29
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:31,505
I'm permanently removing it because I copied it. And then I'll remove person

30
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:36,771
and I'll remove simulation. So like I just mentioned, right now Car isn't

31
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:40,668
compiling. What import statements would you need to add to this project to make

32
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:44,762
it compile again? Go ahead and reorganize all of the classes into the right

33
00:02:44,762 --> 00:02:50,954
packages. Then to get the CarShareApp running again. To which class should I

34
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:55,770
add the import com.udacity.person? Write none if I never need to import this.

35
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,510
To which class should I add the import com.udacity.carshare.car? And to which

36
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:07,053
close should I add the import com.udacity.carshare.simulation? And remember

37
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,998
write none if you never use a particular import statement. And separate answers

38
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:15,161
with commas, if you find that there are two classes that use the same import.
