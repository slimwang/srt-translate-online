1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is easily obtained if you just

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
subtract -3 for each step.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We get 88 and 85 over here.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We could also reach the same value going around here.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So, 85 would have been the right answer,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and this will be the value function after convergence.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's beautiful to see that the value function is effective

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
the distance to the positive absorbing state times 3

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
subtracted from 100.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So, we have 97, 94, 91, 88, 85 and so on.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This is a degenerate case.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If we have a deterministic state transition function,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
it gets more tricky to calculate for the stochastic case.
