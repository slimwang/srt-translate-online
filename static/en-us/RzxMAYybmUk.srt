00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,259
Here's a question for you. What is it that makes us most human? Is it our

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,098
opposable thumbs? Is it walking on two feet? Well, I would argue, it's the

3
00:00:09,098 --> 00:00:13,700
brain, its overall size and structure. Now, the brain has not always looked

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,490
like this. 3 million years ago with the first humans, habilis, it was much

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,392
smaller. And then, we had erectus, and then we had neandethal, and in the last

6
00:00:22,392 --> 00:00:27,745
200,000 years we've had us, modern humans, or homo sapiens. And the thing that

7
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:30,800
really has changed across these different species is the frontal lobe, right

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,196
here. It's bigger, it's more complex. And it's the frontal lobes that really do

9
00:00:36,196 --> 00:00:39,730
make us human. It's where we think abstractly, it's where we have working

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:45,505
memory, think about the past and the future. And, we're creative. And it's that

11
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:49,730
creativity saw first or long ago in the, the cave paintings, and we continue to

12
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:56,448
see, currently, in modern society, to expose of creativity. Art, science,

13
00:00:56,448 --> 00:01:01,842
music, dance, and so on. So, I would argue, it's the brain that makes us most

14
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:03,070
human.
