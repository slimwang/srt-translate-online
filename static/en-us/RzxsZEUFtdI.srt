The answers.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:07,849
For P and P implies Q, we know that
P is true in these bottom two cases.

3
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:11,077
In P implies Q,
we saw on the truth table for

4
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:15,579
P implies Q is true in the first,
second, and fourth case.

5
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:24,339
So the only case that's true for both
P and P implies Q is, the fourth case.

6
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:29,009
Now, this formula,
not the quantity, not P or not Q,

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,219
we can work that out to
be the same as P And Q.

8
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:40,420
And we know that P and
Q is true only when both are true.

9
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,300
So that would be true only in the fourth
case and none of the other cases.

10
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:47,250
And now, we're asking for

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,119
an equivalence or
bi-conditional between these two cases.

12
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,259
Is this one the same as this one?

13
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:57,250
And we see that it is the same,
because they match up In all four cases.

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,740
They're false for each of the first
three and true in the fourth one, so

15
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,930
that means that this is going
to be true no matter what.

16
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,240
They're always equivalent,
either both false or both true and so,

17
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:12,399
we should check all four boxes.
