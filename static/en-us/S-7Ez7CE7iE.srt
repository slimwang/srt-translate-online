00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,450
In our growing diagram, the indicator that is the frequency indicator,

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,939
is a single state which I have labeled here frequency. And there is

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:13,220
no transition, that is the user can't directly move that vertical bar around.

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,120
It will be the job of the station knob when the user does undergo a particular

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,970
transition. By turning the knob to somehow affect the station machine,

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,280
concurrently executing machine. As I said,

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,870
we will delay dealing with that until a little later.
