1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:09,599
We've got 50 particles with a lifetime of one second. So that would be one second plus one second plus one second, and so on,

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:19,299
50 times. And we've got 50 other particles with a lifetime of five seconds, plus five seconds, plus five seconds, plus, and so on,

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:30,832
50 times. Divided by the number of particles, which is 100. So it's 50 seconds plus 250 seconds.

4
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:40,899
Which makes 300 seconds divided by 100. Is three seconds. So the solution should be three seconds.

5
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:48,166
And there's something to note here. We could have computed the area below that curve--

6
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:52,232
Well, below that staircase, and divide that area by 100.

7
00:00:52,233 --> 00:01:04,599
That's the same. The area is 50 times one second, plus 50 times five seconds, which is our numerator,

8
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:11,266
and we have to divide that by 100. And of course, that's going to be true no matter what the shape of this curve is.

9
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:18,967
So this is the area divided by the initial number, the total number of particles.
