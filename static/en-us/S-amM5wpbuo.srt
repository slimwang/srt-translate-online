00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,300
In the last lesson we've trained
a simple logistic classifier on images.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,520
Now, we're going to take this classifier
and turn it into a deep network.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,660
And it's going to be
just a few lines of code,

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,450
so make sure you understand well what
was going on in the previous model.

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,290
In the second part you are going to take
a small peak into how our optimizer does

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,688
all the hard work for you computing
gradients for arbitrary functions.

7
00:00:25,688 --> 00:00:28,951
And then we are going to look
together at the important topic of

8
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:32,991
regularization, which will enable us
to train much, much larger models.
