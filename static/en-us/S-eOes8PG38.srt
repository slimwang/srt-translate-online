1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,650
Why is this an important application class to consider? Well,

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,450
obviously the Internet has just opened up so many different opportunities for

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:13,030
applications. That means, not only more applications but more customers,

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:19,150
heavier load, increasing demand on the resources. Hence,

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:24,260
performance and resource consumptions considerations, nonfunctional constraints.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,750
Also, the hardware resources themselves have become more specialized.

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:34,220
Think about ATM machines or card readers at gas stations, or

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,680
mobile phones, or square card readers.

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,260
Just all kinds of devices that have their own peculiarities.

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,640
Also we've seen increasingly powerful applications, okay, that involve

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,280
integrations of existing components, and sometimes even negotiation among them.
