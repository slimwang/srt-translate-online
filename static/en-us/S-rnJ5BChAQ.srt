00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,268
We've broken down non-predictive data
analysis in the four categories,

2
00:00:05,268 --> 00:00:09,880
geospatial, segmentation,
aggregation and descriptive.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,100
Let's talk about each category.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,120
First, what is geospatial analysis?

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,030
This type of analysis
uses location-based data

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,290
to help drive your conclusions.

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,510
Some examples are identifying
customers by a geographic dimension,

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,490
such as zip code, state, or county.

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,670
Calculating the distance between
addresses and your stores, or

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,600
creating a trade area based upon your
customer locations for further analysis.

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,220
Some types of geospatial analysis
require the use of special software,

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,190
such as software that can convert
an address to latitude and longitude.

13
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,600
Or software that can calculate
the drive time between two geographic

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,360
points on a map.
