Welcome to the lesson on Feature Selection.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,910
I think Albert Einstein probably said it best when he said you

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,020
should make everything as simple as possible, but no simpler.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,070
This is the idea behind feature selection, that you want to have

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,110
the minimal number of features that it takes to really capture the trends and

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,760
the patterns in your data.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,210
Your machine learning algorithm is only going to be as good as the features that

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,300
you put into it.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,910
So this is a place where you should really put some time and

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,740
attention as a machine learner.

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,900
There are two major things that are involved here.

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,740
The first is that you should have a way to select the best features that

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,130
are available to you.

14
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,450
In other words getting rid of the stuff that doesn't help you very much.

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,230
On the other hand there will be hopefully patterns in your data that you

16
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,660
need to draw out, and so potentially adding new features can

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,270
be ways that you can use your human intuition to access those patterns.

18
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,400
We'll go through both of these examples in this lesson.
