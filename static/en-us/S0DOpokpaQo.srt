1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's spell out what this first term means --

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
(t + h + 1)³--

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
here comes the trick -- I write it as

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:23,000
((t + 1) + h) * ((t + 1) + h) * ((t + 1) + h).

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I just reshuffled the different terms --

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
t + 1 + h, t + 1 + h and 3 factors of

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that sort gives the 3rd power.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What do i get? (t + 1) * (t + 1) * (t + 1) = (t + 1)³.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Then I get terms of that sort--

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
h * (t + 1) * (t + 1),

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
h * (t + 1) * (t + 1) is, of course, (t + 1)².

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How many terms of that sort do I get?

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
h * this one * this one is one of that sort.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
(t + 1) * h * (t + 1);

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
second one, and (t + 1) * (t + 1) * h;

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
a third one, 3 terms of that type plus everything else has h² in it --

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
h * h * (t + 1) or (t + 1) * h * h

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
or even h * h * h,

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So, whatever happens to appear next is the h² times something.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So what do we get?

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:54,000
1/h times -- (t + 1)³, (t + 1)³ cancels -- 3h(t + 1)² + h² times something.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And look what happens -- we divide by h,

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
h/h cancels, h²/h becomes h,

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and in the end, we are left with 3(t + 1)², and this term is negligible.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So the answer would be 3(t + 1)².

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Of course, you may already know that there's tons

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
of rules how to compute derivatives.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
In the end, they're just shortcuts of such computations.
