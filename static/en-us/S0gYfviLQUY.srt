1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,090
Okay so if you've followed all the
previous steps correctly you're going to

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,910
end up with source code
that looks like this.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,270
First of all in your build.gradle file
you should see the entry here for those

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,110
services libraries, as we've discussed
and as we've been using all along.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,850
Next in your AndroidManifest file
you should see a number of things.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,200
First, you can see where I've
added the OpenGL libraries.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,340
Second, you can see where the service
libraries have been added and

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,920
it's the same as you've been doing all
along when building applications that

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,530
use the services.

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,410
Third is the API key.

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,210
And if you remember from the early
example you created API key and

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,890
you were able to put the API key
in your meta data as shown here.

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,140
Now before you run this application, you
have to associate this application with

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,670
the same API key in the developer's
console, and I'll show that in a moment.

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,800
And then finally is
the user's permissions.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,500
As you can see here,

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,222
we have INTERNET, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE,
and WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE setup.
