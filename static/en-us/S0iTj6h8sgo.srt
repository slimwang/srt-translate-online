1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,000
So I'm going to start off with for

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,240
job in work dot jobs, which is giving me the jobs array in the work object.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,510
Then I'm going to append HTMLworkStart to the work experience div,

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,970
which we can see right here in our HTML.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,110
Then, I'm going to work on formatting the employer in the title.

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,136
To do so, I use the HTMLworkEmployer and

7
00:00:21,136 --> 00:00:24,096
HTMLworkTitle strings that are in helper.js.

8
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:26,122
Calling the replace method on both of them,.

9
00:00:26,122 --> 00:00:29,710
I will replace the placeholder data with our employer and

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,060
our title from the work.jobs object.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,556
Notice here I'm using job, the iterator from the for

12
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:42,060
in loop, as the index of the job that we want inside the work.jobs object.

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,470
This variable, formatted employer title,

14
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,490
is a concatenation of formatted employer and formatted title.

15
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,980
We're just adding them together.

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,490
This last line here .appends the formatted employer title,

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,230
which we just created to .work-entry:last.

18
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,190
Now this is an interesting syntax.

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,180
In jQuery, we're selecting every object with a class work-entry.

20
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,210
We know we want a class because it has a dot in front of it.

21
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,250
But then, this colon last tells us that we specifically want to

22
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,200
append this formatted employer title to the last element

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,060
with the class work-entry on the page, which should be the one we just created.

24
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,450
Let's go ahead and check our work.

25
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,870
We've refreshed the page and we can see that within the work experience section,

26
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,040
we can see our two entries for

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,180
work experience for Planet Express and Panucci's Pizza.

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,180
>> And it looks good too
