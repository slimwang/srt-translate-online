00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,750
The problem that the composite pattern addresses is how to

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,670
organize information about whole parts relationships. That is,

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,510
situations where you have to keep track of data about things and their parts.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,820
This is a common problem in software development. Think, for example,

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,660
about user interfaces which are built from widgets such as windows, menus and

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,010
forms. That are made by, made up of other widgets, text boxes, dialogues,

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,290
color choosers, and so on. Other examples of composites include web pages made

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,900
up of frames, pictures, texts, and links. Documents made up of chapters, tables,

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,090
diagrams, and paragraphs. And UML diagrams made up of boxes and lines.
