00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:06,460
Here's the Sent Memes view, it's
the first screen presented upon launch.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,770
The Sent Memes view keeps track
of all recently sent memes.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,850
Here you can see a few that I
sent to my teammates earlier.

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,219
You can see the memes in a table view or
a grid.

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,210
Notice how I can switch back and
forth using these tabs.

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,770
When I press the grid icon,
the collection view appears.

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,090
When I press the table icon
the table view appears.

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,710
The grid is created using a UI
collection view controller.

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,080
It's similar to the UI
table view controller but

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,510
has a more flexible layout mechanism.

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,930
Both of these views access
the same meme model objects, and

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,190
they're embedded in
a tab bar controller.

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,150
From the Sent Memes page, the user
can go back and create new memes.

14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,627
When I press the button with the plus
icon in the right corner the meme

15
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:49,406
editor slides up from the bottom.

16
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:51,400
Now I can make a new meme.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,450
Here I'll make one about my
favorite cow on the beach.

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,901
And of course when we're done with
our new meme we'll want to share it.

19
00:01:01,618 --> 00:01:05,720
Here, let's send this one to Sebastian.

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,946
When the meme has been sent,
the meme editor slides back down and

21
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:11,470
the Sent Memes view is revealed again.

22
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,180
And this time the collection
includes the new cow meme.

23
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,540
And that's meme me 2.0.
