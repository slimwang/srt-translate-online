1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,660
I have to tell you this
worked extremely well.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,420
These are some examples taken both from
their original paper and some others, so

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,440
they were showing it running on
all of these different images.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,310
Some of which are shall we say,
you know, typical computer vision images

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,650
where the face is right there,
some of them are much harder, right?

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,170
Now you'll notice, and we'll get to this
in a minute, that this guy is missed.

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,750
You know why he's missed.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,970
It's not, because he's not good looking.

9
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,310
I have no idea whether he's good
looking, that's up to you guys.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,930
It's because he's turned this way, and
the thing was trained on frontal faces.

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,260
Here's some more examples.

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,190
You know, I love the Star Trek one
that it worked really well, but for

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,260
some reason Scotty there, James Doohan,
I don't know if it's the mustache,

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,280
whatever it is.

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,250
This thing likes Vulcan's more
than it likes Scottish people,

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,420
can't explain why?

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,120
But basically the idea is the thing
was able to work, extremely well.

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,040
It also dates it a little bit, because
here's a picture of the Seinfeld Cast,

19
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,310
so that tells you something
about when this work was done.

20
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,430
Some interesting errors.

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,660
Notice this one down here, okay?

22
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,580
So we got all the faces on
the soccer player, football for

23
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,020
those of you not in the states.

24
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,610
All right?
But,

25
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,660
take a look at the ball at
the bottom there, right?

26
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,660
Now if you kind of squint
at that a little bit, oh,

27
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,380
I'll just take off my glasses and
look at that and say,

28
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,970
oh yeah, it's George and they say,
no, that's a soccer ball.

29
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,720
The distribution of the pattern was
kind of close and it labeled it.

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,120
Here's some more examples.

31
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,240
And again, you'll see that this profile
was not done so well, so what do you do?

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,290
Well, how about training some profiles?

33
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,610
Again, train the classifier using the
same types of rectangular features and

34
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,270
now all of a sudden you
can find faces site,

35
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,000
you know, these faces here and
those faces there.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,080
Couple of cute things
that were done by folks.

37
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,810
They found faces in video.

38
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:49,440
That was done easily, but the video came
from broadcast video that had annotated,

39
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,530
subtitles, including characters, and
they started to be able to associate

40
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,370
different faces with
different characters.

41
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:59,390
So eventually, as you can see, it would
recognize Buffy the Vampire Slayer,

42
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,070
because after all who would be
complete without recognizing Buffy

43
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,410
the Vampire Slayer, but
the work was very cool.

44
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,860
So here's an article pulled out 2007, so
most of you used Google's Street View.

45
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,050
Well, when Google's Street View
first came out,

46
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,990
there were people's faces in it.

47
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,510
Actually it's not totally true
because they knew this was

48
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,360
going to be a problem.

49
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,200
But as you could imagine, people didn't
want their faces, and by the way,

50
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,780
not just one.

51
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,920
In the United States you can push
back a little bit in terms of faces.

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,820
In Europe, you have a much greater
right to your own face, or

53
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,200
I should say to the image
of your own face.

54
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,960
So it was very important that
Google be able to remove,

55
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,510
the faces of people
from their street view.

56
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,650
So to remove them,
you have to detect them,

57
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,060
and they're not going to pay 9 million
undergraduates to sit there and

58
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,420
click on all the faces, so
that you run the recognizer.

59
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,070
Here's a thing pulled out from iPhoto.

60
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,554
Most of you have an image in
our introduction you know,

61
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:54,042
on the back of your camera
where it finds all the faces.

62
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:58,141
Many of those systems use either
the Beulah Jones method or

63
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:00,220
some version of it.

64
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,360
I do like the, Lana had this picture
of things that iPhoto thought was face.

65
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,500
Here's a picture of a sort of a teddy
bear made in chocolate chip cookies, and

66
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,160
iPhoto thought it was a face,
because the pattern is about right.
