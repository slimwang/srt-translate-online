Welcome to the homework assignment on computer vision.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I will first ask you a few questions about perspective projection

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
in which you will exercise the math that we explored

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that relates the size of an object in the scene, uppercase X,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
with the depth for the range to the pinhole camera Z, the focal length f,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and the size of the projection, small x.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Remember from class the following equation.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm literally dropping the minus sign. I want all numbers to be positive in this example.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So please don't worry about the minus sign that might not occur

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
in this specific version of the equation.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll give you three values for X, Z, f,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and would like you to understand what the missing value is.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
X is measured in meters and the same with Z.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
f is in millimeters and so is lowercase x.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Here's my first question. Suppose X is 10 m in size.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's 100 meters away. Suppose our focal length is 10 mm.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How large is our projection lowercase x in millimeters?

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now we're asking you what is the focal length if an object of size 20 m that is 400 meters out

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
if we observe it to be 1 mm on our projection surface.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Suppose we have a 2 m sized object that with a 40 mm focal length

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
appears to be 1 mm in size. What is the distance of this object to the camera?

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Finally, say a known object is 300 m away.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Our focal length is now 100 mm, and the object is again 1mm.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
How far is this object away in meters?
