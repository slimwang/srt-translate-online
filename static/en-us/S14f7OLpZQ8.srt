00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,840
This is one of my favorite parts
of user research, because it shows

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,740
just how much of the process you can
go without, if you're in a rush.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,830
Of all these options, the only two that
we thought were going to critical when

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,580
we started, was whether the user
can create a new event, and

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,300
whether users can easily find
a way to check off tasks.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,770
Once we identified that you had trouble
finding the way to check off a task,

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,370
that also elevated the question of
whether users would like to be able to

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,510
check off tasks on the home
screen to critical.

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,820
There are a couple of informational
questions which you may consider

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,520
critical, as well.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,450
Knowing how to make the check boxes
stand out as well as figuring out where

12
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,040
to put our delete buttons
are important parts of the story.

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,800
Given all this feedback and

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,820
that we have data on every critical
question, the main task of our app.

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,900
And the things in
the way of those tasks.

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,480
It looks like our
prototype was a success.

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,030
We haven't decided whether our
design was a success though.

18
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,640
To do that,
we need to be sure we have enough data
