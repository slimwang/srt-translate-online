00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,540
Okay. Now that you've been through the material from Lesson

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,030
One, let's see if you can complete the concept map

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,420
that we showed earlier. Remember a concept map is just

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,950
connecting words to each other using other concepts or words that

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,820
are relevant to both. For example, a genome is a

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,640
genetic instructions for traits, and both are influenced by something that

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,850
belongs in this blank here. What I want you to

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,790
do is fill in each blank you see in the concept

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,870
map using words that you find in the word bank

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,500
over here. If you think you know the correct word for

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,820
that blank, just take it from the word bank and

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,350
type it into the box you see in the concept map.
