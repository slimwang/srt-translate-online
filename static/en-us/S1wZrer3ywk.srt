00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,910
In the instructor notes,
you'll find the URL for this revel.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:09,080
The first step is, unsurprisingly,
on branch step one.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,760
So, make sure you checked
it out correctly.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,990
Now, let's go to Xcode.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,250
Let's first take a look
at the main storyboard.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,890
As you can see, it's very simple, and

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,670
it has one image view,
a slider, and three buttons.

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:31,460
The slider changes the alpha channel or
transparency of the image view.

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,920
So, it's basically there so
we can tell if the UI is blocked or not.

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,960
If you can move it while it's downloaded
it means the UI is not blocked.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,730
Whenever you lick on
any of these buttons,

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,530
a large image will be downloaded.

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,570
This is by far the easiest way to block.

14
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,310
So for each button we'll
write a different action.

15
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:58,550
The first button, over here, sync, will
use a naive serial code that blocks.

16
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,740
The second button will use in
an asynchronous version using GCD.

17
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,440
And the last button,

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,320
will use a more elegant version
that takes a completion closure.

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,090
Let's get started.
