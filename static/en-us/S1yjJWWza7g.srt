1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,510
In this case, the distribution on the right is going to have the larger sum of

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,060
squared errors, and it should be fairly straightforward to see why.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,130
You can compare point by point, these would be all the errors on the left.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,990
There's very similar sum of squared errors on the right for these data points.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,660
But, then on the right, you have all these additional data points.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,850
And each one of those is going to contribute a little bit of error

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,420
that we'll add to the overall sum of squared errors of the fit here.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,660
So what that means is that the distribution on the right has a larger sum of

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,650
squared errors even though we agreed that it's probably not

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,130
doing a much worse job of fitting the data than the distribution on the left.

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,840
And this is one of the shortcomings of the sum of squared error in

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,530
general as an evaluation metric.

13
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,950
Is that as you add more data the sum of the squared error will almost certainly

14
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,310
go up, but it doesn't necessarily mean that your fit is doing a worse job.

15
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:53,250
However, if your comparing two sets of data that have different number of

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,460
points in them then this can be a big problem, because if your using the sum of

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,630
square errors to figure out which one is being fit better.

18
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,360
Then the sum of squared errors can be jerked around by the number of data

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,040
points that you're using, even though the fit might be perfectly fine.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,770
So this motivates me to tell you about one other evaluation metric that's very

21
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,910
popular when evaluating regressions.
