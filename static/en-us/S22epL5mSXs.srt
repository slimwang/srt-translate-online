1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,850
So now with that kind of magic function if-better we could solve all the three problems

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,920
we have looked at so far in polynomial time.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,840
We could solve vertex cover, we could solve independent set,

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,740
and we could solve clique in polynomial time.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,830
Now theoretical computer scientists like to divide problems into so-called complexity classes.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,890
And a complexity class basically contains all problems that can be solved

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,140
on a given machine within a specified time or a specified memory or even both.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,200
But we're going to stick with time for now.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,650
So if we draw this as a matrix and put time here and the machine here

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,680
then so far we learned about two different types of time.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,400
We have learned about polynomial time and we have learned about exponential time,

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,280
and we have the normal RAM, the model that has basically the same capabilities as any computer

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,540
that you know, and we have just learned about the RAM that has the if-better function available.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,650
Each of these fields here in the matrix is a complexity class.

15
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:59,370
So this field here, for example, would contain all problems that can be solved

16
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,300
in exponential time on a normal RAM.

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:11,110
So vertex cover, independent set, and clique would all be contained in this class.

18
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,320
But of course they can also be contained in other classes and I would actually like you

19
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,300
to figure this out as our next quiz and the question is,

20
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,630
in which other complexity classes, so this one here, this one here, or this one here,

21
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,870
can we put our three problems vertex cover, independent set, and clique?

22
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,900
And I would like you to make a check mark if you're sure

23
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,840
that we can put these problems into that complexity class.

24
00:01:31,840 --> 99:59:59,999
If you're sure that we cannot do that or if we're not certain, I want you to leave that field blank.
