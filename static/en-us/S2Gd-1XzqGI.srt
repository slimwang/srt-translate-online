1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,936
For the moment I'm going to call the length of our flight path just the letter

2
00:00:04,948 --> 00:00:09,847
d. That will make dealing with it in equations much simpler. The Pythagorean

3
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:14,974
theorem says that because this is a right triangle, we can say that 200 squared

4
00:00:14,986 --> 00:00:19,932
plus 700 squared equals d squared. Simplifying that gives us 530,000 equals d

5
00:00:19,944 --> 00:00:24,380
squared. In order to get d by itself, what do we need to do? Just take the

6
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:29,093
square root of both sides. Taking the square root of d squared, just leaves us

7
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:33,471
with d. The square root of 530,000 gives us a number with a ton of decimal

8
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:38,100
places, but when we round it, we get 728, which, since we're rounding, I will

9
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:43,538
say is about equal to d. Since our flight is really kind of approximate any way,

10
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:48,968
we can add to it that this length from Grant's hometown to Udacity is about 728

11
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,378
miles.
