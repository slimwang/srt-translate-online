1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
We're going to assume that we have

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
what we know is a random oracle,

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which is an ideal cryptographic hash function.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And this random oracle assumption means that we can have

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
an ideal cryptographic hash function

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that match any input to H with a uniform distribution.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And, an attacker trying to find collisions

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
can do no better than a brute force search on the size of H.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So, that's what we will assume we have.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Before we go forward with that assumption,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I want to ask a quiz--whether random oracles actually exist.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The answers are: Yes, they do, and we know of one;

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
maybe they exist but we don't know of one yet;

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
or, no, it's impossible to actually build a random log.
