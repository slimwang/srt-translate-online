00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,750
For a second quiz,

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,750
imagine a program that plays tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,820
I've listed a set of four requirements,

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,230
put an F next to each of the requirements that is a functional requirement and

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,280
an N next to each that is a non-functional requirement.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,360
First, the system should check for illegal moves by the human.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,400
Second, the system should respond to human moves within 5 seconds.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,050
Third, the system must be written in Java, and fourth,

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,750
the system should allow the human to use either a X or O as his or her marker.
