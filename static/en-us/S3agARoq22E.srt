1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,718
Our hope in designing this program
was to create something that

2
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:06,810
combined the very best
materials on offer.

3
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:11,759
We wanted to deliver a class that was
better than anything any one person or

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,619
organization could do.

5
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:18,155
So we've combined the very best
foundational information with exclusive

6
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:19,092
new material.

7
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:23,623
We've also put together a team of the
best AI brains on the planet to act as

8
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,370
your guides.

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,740
We are delighted, this program
features my friend Peter Norvig,

10
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:30,859
director of research at Google,

11
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:35,409
who quite literally wrote the leading
textbook on artificial intelligence.

12
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:39,479
We also meet my friend Thad Starner,
who's founder and director

13
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,899
of the Contextual Computing Group at
Georgia Tech's College of Computing and

14
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:47,049
a researcher at my very own Google X.

15
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:50,359
In fact, much of the material in this
program is taught to computer science

16
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:54,909
master students around the world
including Stanford and Georgia Tech.

17
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:58,369
I hope that gives you a sense of
the quality of the teaching here.

18
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:04,159
Arpan Chakraborty and David Joyner, will
act as further guides on your journey.

19
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,269
Arpan has a PhD in computer vision,

20
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:10,849
while David won Georgia Tech's
Lockheed Excellence Teaching Award and

21
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:14,479
has been lecturing in AI for
more than three years.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,555
And in the next few videos, Dhruv
Parthasarathy who focused on AI for

23
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:22,982
both his undergrad and
masters degree at MIT.

24
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:25,978
And who is the director of
the AI Program here at Udacity,

25
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:29,795
will give you a bird's eye
view of this new nanodegree.

26
00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:31,890
You'll even see more of me again.

27
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,123
So now, over to Dhruv who'll show you
what you built during this course.

28
00:01:37,123 --> 00:01:40,118
