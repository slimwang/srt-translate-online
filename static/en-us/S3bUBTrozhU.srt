So far, we have two methods in our class. We have add friend, and un-friend.

00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,480
Now, since John and Maria are no longer friends, John went on a friend adding

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,090
binge. He forgot who was in his friends list because there were so many of

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,390
them. We need a method to get all the friends in John's friends list. For

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,170
example, it might return Ann, Fred, Barney. What is the public interface for

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,020
the method that lists friends? If you need a hint, think about what the method

00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,805
call would look like.
