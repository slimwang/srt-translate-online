1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,860
So what we're going to do is in order to figure how to

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:09,480
go from an image to the shape we're going to talk about this reflectance map.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,880
So the reflectance map relates the brightness I of (x, y).

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,050
And again I'm just going to talk about sort of the brightness in the image

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,860
assuming that the image is linear with respect to the light that is hitting it.

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,380
So I'm not going to talk more about radiance or irradiance etc.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,910
I'm just talking, talking about the lightness or

8
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,220
the brightness of the image, all right.

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,619
So the reflectance map relates the image brightness to the surface orientation.

10
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,290
Remember (p,q).

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,080
For a given source direction and a given surface reflectance, okay?

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,140
So this assumes for the moment that you know the source direction and

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,470
you know the surface reflectance.

14
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,390
Let's first consider the Lambertian case, all right?

15
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,010
So here we have our same math again.

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,180
We're going to assume that we've got some source brightness,

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,860
which we'll just call k here.

18
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,010
We have some surface albedo row.

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,250
And we're just going to use our same equation as we had before

20
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,030
that row times k times the cosine of the incident angle, right.

21
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,130
That's the angle between the source and

22
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,100
the normal, is what's going to determine how bright our image is.

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,120
And what we're going to do for the next little bit,

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,060
is we're going to assume that just row times K equals one.

25
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,510
Or another way of saying it is,

26
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:27,310
we're just going to assume that our image intensity is the cosine of the angle.

27
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,490
You could make it proportional to the cosine of the angle, but

28
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,240
the idea is that it's a fixed number.

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,530
In fact, later we are going to assume that it's proportional.

30
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,640
Clearly what matters in the brightness that we see is this angle,

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,090
the incident angle between the normal and the light source.

32
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,200
Alright, so here is the mathematics of our Lambertian system,

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,790
and in order to try to keep everything straight, I've sort of color coded.

34
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,100
The normal is pinkish, purplish.

35
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,530
Magenta, is that fuchsia?

36
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,140
Yeah, I don't know.

37
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,660
I don't really know my colors.

38
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,400
And this sickly green bluish I don't know, some color.

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,320
So we got sickly purple and sickly green.

40
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,258
But just keep them straight, all right?

41
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,770
But the idea is the purple is the surface normal,

42
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,210
the green is the direction towards the illuminant.

43
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,470
So the dot product that we showed before is just

44
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,650
p times ps plus q times qs plus 1 over the normalization.

45
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,200
And we refer to that as R of p,q.

46
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,580
And this is the reflectance map in this Lambertian case, okay?

47
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,910
So this R of p,q.

48
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,310
So what is that going to look like in pq space.

49
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,030
Well to take, figure that out, we can actually just do it algebraically.

50
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,540
But it's actually kind of cooler to do it geometrically.

51
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,760
All right.

52
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,390
So here we have our light source.

53
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,850
And we have some vector pointing up to our light source.

54
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,240
Now if I have, if my normal is some theta i away from it,

55
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,218
that means that it is in some cone.

56
00:02:58,218 --> 00:03:02,070
Around that that light source direction, right.

57
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,030
So for that constant cosine of I, or some constant theta of I,

58
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,930
that's a cone around the illumination direction, alright.

59
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:16,730
Well, I can project, remember, pq space allows me to map any direction,

60
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,850
any surface orientation, to a PQ location, right?

61
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,790
So I'm going to project that constant cone up into PQ space and

62
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,870
I'm going to get this, this elliptical.

63
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,770
It's not really ellipse.

64
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,150
I'm just going to get this cone sliced by a plane.

65
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,660
And the idea is that everywhere along that curve

66
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:45,510
is the same cosine angle between the surface-normal and the source direction.

67
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,520
So that means that it's equally bright.

68
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,710
Those are referred to as iso brightness contours in pq space.

69
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,200
That's a lot to say, but basically, along that curve in,

70
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,100
in pq space, I get the same intensity.

71
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,920
Because that curve represents the set of

72
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,060
possible angles that are the same cosine theta away from the source direction.
