00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I will now talk about fitting Gaussians to data or Gaussian learning.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You may be given some data points, and you might worry about

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
what is the best Guassian fitting the data?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now, to explain this, let me first tell you what parameters characterizes a Gaussian.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In the 1-dimensional case, it is mu and sigma squared.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Mu is the mean. Sigma squared is called the variance.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If we look at the formula of a Gaussian, it's a function over any possible input X,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and it requires knowledge of mu and sigma squared.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And as before, I'm just restating what I said before.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We get this function over here that specifies any probability

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
for a value X given a specific mu and sigma squared.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Suppose we wish to fit data, and our data is 1-dimensional, and it looks as follows.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Just looking at this diagram makes me believe

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that there's a high density of data points over here

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and a fading density of data points over there,

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
so maybe the most likely Gaussian will look a little bit like this

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
where this is mu and this is sigma.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
They are really easy formulas for fitting data to Gaussians,

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and I'll give you the result right now.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The optimal or most likely mean is just the average of the data points.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There's M data points, X1 to Xm.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The average will look like this.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The sum of all data points divided by the total number of data points.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's called the average, and once you calculate the average,

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the sigma squared is obtained by a similar normalization

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
in a slightly more complex sum.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We sum the deviation from the mean

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and compute the average deviation to the square from the mean,

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and that gives us sigma squared.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So, intuitively speaking, the formulas are really easy.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Mu is the mean, or the average.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Sigma squared is the average quadratic deviation from the mean, as shown over here.
