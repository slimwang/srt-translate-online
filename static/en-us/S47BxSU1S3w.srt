1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, what value should E choose for P?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Remember, you've got an infinite number of choices

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
for any value for P.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Well, if E chose a value of P

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
such that this value here

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
was larger than this value here,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
then O would know to always play 1,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and similarly, if this value was larger,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
then O would know to always play 2.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So, it seems that what E wants to do

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
is choose the value of P such that these 2 are equal.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So, how much is that? Well, let's see.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is 2P - 3 - P.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's 5P - 3,

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and we want to set that equal to -3 + 4 - P.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's -7P + 4.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And let's gather the terms together.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So, that would be 12P = 7

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
or P = 7/12.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So, if E chooses the value of P = 7/12,

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
so 7/12 of the time play 1,

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
5/12 of the time play 2,

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
then O doesn't know what to do.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No matter whether he chooses 1 or 2, he gets the same result.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And you can do the same calculation over here,

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and it turns out that Q also equals 7/12.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Now, let's take this strategy of P = 7/12, 1,

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and feed it back into the matrix for the game,

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and if E plays this strategy of 7/12, 1, 5/12, 2,

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
then no matter what the strategy O plays,

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
the value of the game to E, the utility to E is -1/12.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And then we can do the same computation over here.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If Q has the strategy 7/12, 1, and 5/12, 2,

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
then we plug that back into here, and no matter what strategy E chooses,

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the value there is also -1/12.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And so now we've shown that the utility to E

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
is greater than or equal to -1/12

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and less than or equal to -1/12.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
In other words, the utility to E

40
00:02:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is exactly -1/12, so we've solved the game.
