00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,946
The way I solved this puzzle was to first align my right hand to the directions

2
00:00:05,946 --> 00:00:10,370
given in the beta, X south, Z west, and Y up. If I could do it, then I know the

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:15,446
system was right-handed. Easy enough, my right hand aligns just fine. If I try

4
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:18,694
the same thing with my left hand, I can get 2 out of 3 axis to align but the

5
00:00:18,694 --> 00:00:22,760
third is always in the opposite direction. So, we know the beta version of

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,348
minecraft used right hand coordinates. I could solve the second half of the

7
00:00:26,348 --> 00:00:29,780
question by reorienting my right hand and again, noticing that the fingers can

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,916
properly align with the axes. So, it is also right-handed. However, you don't

9
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:38,186
really need to use your hands to figure this out. What happened within the world

10
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:41,976
itself was simply that the sun started to rise form a different direction. None

11
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:45,458
of the world's data had changed at all. The only thing that had changed was our

12
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:48,950
perception of which direction was east. Since the world was the same as before,

13
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,702
the underlying coordinate system itself had not changed. Realizing this, I could

14
00:00:52,702 --> 00:00:56,926
conclude that the released version is still right-handed, just like the beta,

15
00:00:56,926 --> 00:00:59,393
but it never hurts to check with my right hand.
