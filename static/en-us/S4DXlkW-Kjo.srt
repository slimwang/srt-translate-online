1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,060
Now that we know our test is failing,
let's start iterating

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,080
on our implementation and
get this test turned green.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,680
We'll need to first edit our
source/AddressBook.js file and

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,095
start writing our
implementation in there.

5
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:15,825
If we look back at our spec
runner we'll see the error

6
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:21,145
AddressBook is not defined, and
that error resides on line 3 of our

7
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:26,305
AddressBook spec where we were
instantiating our object.

8
00:00:26,305 --> 00:00:29,665
This is an easy error to fix,
we'll just write a constructor function.

9
00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:35,330
If we refresh our spec runner, we'll see
a new error; Contact is not defined.

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,410
To resolve this error, we also need
to write a contact constructor.

11
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,640
To keep everything organized,

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,330
I created a new file called Contact.js,
in my source directory.

13
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,860
And once again,
I wrote a quick constructor function.

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,630
I also had to add this file to my
spec runner, so that it gets run.
