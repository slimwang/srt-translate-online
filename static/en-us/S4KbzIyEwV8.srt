00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,892
>> Unlike the mode, the mean take all values into account because we add them

2
00:00:04,892 --> 00:00:09,745
all up, then we divide by how many values there are. And just to remember, we

3
00:00:09,745 --> 00:00:14,636
pretty much always write these calculations as decimals when we don't get whole

4
00:00:14,636 --> 00:00:19,436
numbers. So, I'm going to calculate the mean for Nursing. And remember, mean is

5
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:24,682
often represented by x bar. So, the mean is 58,350 plus all the rest of the

6
00:00:24,682 --> 00:00:30,633
values in the column divided by 5, because there are 5 values. And when we do

7
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:36,744
that, we get that the mean salary for Nursing, from these values at least, is

8
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:42,758
58,948. So now, find the mean salary for the five Geography majors. I'll call

9
00:00:42,758 --> 00:00:47,370
this x bar sub geo, for Geography. Write your answer in the box.
