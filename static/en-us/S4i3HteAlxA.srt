1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,360
Let's look at the answers.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,380
The first one says we can exclude
a query that we run to derive

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,080
the data from a table that we have
in the database, could exclude

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,460
certain sensitive attributes like social
security number or something like that.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,250
And users can only be given access to
the view where this sensitive data

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,020
is not there.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,540
This is a new derived virtual table
we're talking about, so it doesn't have

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,490
all the attribute values,
in particular the highly sensitive ones.

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,120
So this answer is the correct one.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,990
The next one is not correct because
it says view can only be accessed by

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:37,830
a single user.

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,630
We actually didn't talk about that,
doesn't have to be.

13
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,854
Have a virtual table, or, it depends on
what sort of access control you have in

14
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:48,119
place, but it doesn't have to
be accessed by a single user.
