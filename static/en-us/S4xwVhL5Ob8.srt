00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What I think the best answer is is that we're doing system or validation testing.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
That is to say we're testing the whole system as a unit,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and we're trying it on some small subset of our users

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
to try to validate the fact that the changes we've made

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
are good and that they work and they're not going to cause any sort of major problems

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
when we roll it out for the entire user base.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're not doing random testing because there's no random element here.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're not doing differential testing because we don't

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
have multiple implementations of anything.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We have a single system that we're looking at.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We're not doing integration testing because the character of the testing

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that we're doing here does not have the flavor of putting

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
multiple modules together that haven't been tested together previously.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Rather, we're rolling something out and seeing what happens.
