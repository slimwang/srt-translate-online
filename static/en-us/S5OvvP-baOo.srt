00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,968
Our point of intersection is right here. Because this point lies on the line y

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:12,073
equals 19, we already know that its y-coordinate must be 19. Its x-coordinate we

3
00:00:12,085 --> 00:00:18,370
can find by just tracing this down to the x-axis, straight below the point. And

4
00:00:18,382 --> 00:00:24,842
that is 5. So, our point of intersection is 5,19. The x-coordinate here is 5, so

5
00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:31,283
x must equal 5. Let's check this in our original equation. We started off with

6
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:37,179
the equation 3 x plus 4 equals 19. Let's plug in our x value to see if this

7
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:43,261
works. On the left-hand side, we'll have 3 times 5 plus 4, which simplifies to

8
00:00:43,273 --> 00:00:49,407
19. The right-hand side has no variables, so there's nothing to change, and we

9
00:00:49,419 --> 00:00:56,014
can just write 19. Sure enough, 19 equals 19. So, we're good. x equals 5 is the

10
00:00:56,026 --> 00:00:58,001
correct answer.
