1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,480
By now, you should have built
a small neural network using NumPy.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,780
However, deep learning networks can have
hundreds or thousands of hidden layers.

3
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:11,689
Clearly, NumPy is not up to the task.

4
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:14,080
Instead we'll be using
TensorFlow to build and

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,140
train deep learning models
in the rest of this course.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,350
If you haven't heard of it,

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,940
TensorFlow is a neural network
library developed by Google Brain.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,620
But before you get into TensorFlow

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,050
we've built a lesson to help you
learn about differentiable graphs.

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,240
The fundamental abstraction TensorFlow
uses to run and train networks.

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,560
You'll build a small library called
Miniflow that will be your very own

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,600
version of TensorFlow.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,899
Along the way, you'll gain an
understanding of differentiable graphs

14
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:43,429
as well as backpropagation.
