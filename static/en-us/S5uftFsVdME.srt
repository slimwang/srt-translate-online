00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,636
One thing we know about the stress response, is some of the effects it has on

2
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:07,712
the brain. If you remember from lesson three about the brain, or even our

3
00:00:07,712 --> 00:00:12,862
memory lesson, we know that it's important for learning and memory. In fact,

4
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:16,502
the hippocampus has a large number of receptors for cortisol, which again, is

5
00:00:16,502 --> 00:00:21,703
the stress hormone. We see the stress-related release of cortisol can cause

6
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:27,557
dendrites in the hippocampus to shrink. Now, if you remember from Lesson three,

7
00:00:27,557 --> 00:00:32,546
dendrites are what come off of a neuron to collect information. This shrinkage

8
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:37,335
can interfere with several types of memory. Moreover, we see that stress can

9
00:00:37,335 --> 00:00:42,894
decrease the amount of neurogenesis. So, new neural growth in the hippocampus,

10
00:00:42,894 --> 00:00:47,722
which in turn inhibits synaptic plasticity, which will interfere with learning

11
00:00:47,722 --> 00:00:53,630
and memory. So, in short, stress is bad for learning and memory.
