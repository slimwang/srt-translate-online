To write out 3.1 times 10 to the negative 7th, we need to divide 3.1 by 10,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:10,928
seven times. So that means we need to move the decimal point seven times to the

3
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:16,474
left. Let's do it. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So this is where my

4
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:22,678
decimal point belongs now. Let's fill in our zeros. We have one to the left of

5
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:29,560
the decimal point, and then we have six more zeros before we get to the 3. So

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,199
our answer is 0.00000031. That's a pretty tiny number.
