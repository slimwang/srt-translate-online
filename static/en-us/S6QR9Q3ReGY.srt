00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,270
In this lesson, we learned how
operating systems manage I/O devices.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,010
In particular,

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,360
we talked about the operating system
stack for block-based storage devices.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,830
And in this context,
we also talked about file systems, and

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,900
how they manage how files
are stored on such block devices.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,730
For this, I gave as an example,

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,450
some details of the Linux
file system architecture.
