1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,490
We'll discuss each of this in some
detail beginning with public and

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,688
private keys.

3
00:00:05,688 --> 00:00:11,290
They're used together to facilitate
the secure transfer of information and

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,140
for other purposes.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,329
You can think of them simply as two
numbers that are mathematically related

6
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:18,800
but in a very complex way.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,280
One of them is public and
is freely available.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,850
The other is private and must be
secured, accessible only to its owner.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,600
Given the freely available public key,
it is prohibitively expensive and

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,245
time consuming to calculate
the matching private key.

11
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,695
PKI rests on that core assumption.

12
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:42,455
If you've ever done banking,
paid bills or

13
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:46,315
purchased anything on the Internet,
you've used these keys.
