00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,210
Let's answer a few other questions about these algorithms--alpha, beta and gamma.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:11,550
First, I want you to tell me whether the best-case running time for given input size

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:18,330
is always no longer than the best measured time for each algorithm--true or false.

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,310
Also, I'd like you to tell me whether the worst-case running time for given input size

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,390
is at least the worst measured time for each algorithm.

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,120
I also like to know whether algorithm beta is the fastest for all inputs, not just 100, 200,

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,710
300 and 400 but any input I get that is algorithm beta faster always than alpha and gamma.

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,610
And finally, I'd like to know whether the small inputs the algorithm with exponential behavior

9
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,400
is sometimes faster than the algorithm with polynomial behavior.

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,700
So tell me which of these statements are true and which are false.
