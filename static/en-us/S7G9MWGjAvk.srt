1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,740
Now that you have some experience
presenting off the shelf

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,840
view controllers,

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,320
you're probably wondering how to present
your own custom view controllers.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,970
Here we have an app that
simulates rolling dice.

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,660
The first view controller with
the roll the dice button,

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,440
presents a second view controller
that displays a roll of the dice.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,460
The second view controller can be
presented in the same way as the camera

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,280
roll or the activity views and
alert views.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,990
But this time we have full control
over the displayed view controller.

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,990
The app is currently incomplete.

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,030
In a second, you'll be asked to download
it, and look at the Xcode project.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,470
But before we get into the Xcode files,
let's pause for a second,

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,540
to draw the object diagrams for
the two view controllers.

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,980
That way we can clarify
which IBOutlets and

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,390
IBActions the project should contain.

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,110
The first view controller is simple.

17
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,450
It's just a single button
with a single action.

18
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,010
This is the action that should
trigger the presentation

19
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,870
of the Dice View Controller.

20
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,490
The Dice View Controller
is slightly more complex.

21
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,050
It needs outlets to these two
image views that are for the dice.

22
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,680
It also has one button
with a single action.

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,740
This action will cause the view
controller to be dismissed.

24
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,204
If you look in the instructor notes
you should see a file called dice.zip.

25
00:01:07,204 --> 00:01:09,450
Go ahead and download that file and

26
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,650
then examine the Dice Xcode Project
with the following questions in mind.

27
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,810
Check off each question
as you find the answers.
