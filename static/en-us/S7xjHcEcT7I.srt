00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,855
>> Remember, for perpendicular lines, they're negative reciporicals of one

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:08,020
another. So, we're looking for slopes that are y over x, and negative x over y.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,442
While the slope of these two lines are opposite in sign, they're not

4
00:00:11,442 --> 00:00:15,225
reciprocals. I know the reciprocal of 2 is 1 half. So these lines can't be

5
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:19,309
perpendicular. Parallel lines have the same slope. These aren't the same, so

6
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:23,772
they're not parallel. It must be neither. For the second pair of lines, we know

7
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:28,270
that they must be parallel. The slope is 3 in both cases, so b. Here, I do have

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,773
opposite reciprocals of one another. The reciprocal of 2 5ths is 5 halves and

9
00:00:32,773 --> 00:00:37,299
the slopes are opposite in sign. I don't know what these lines look like, but I

10
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:42,042
know that they cross at a 90 degree angle because they're perpendicular. This

11
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,261
last one is really tricky. We need to remember that there is a 1 as the

12
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:51,240
co-efficient in front of the variables. The reciprocal of 1 or 1 over 1 is still

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,018
1. So these are reciprocals of one another and they're opposite in sign so the

14
00:00:56,018 --> 00:01:00,416
lines are perpendicular. If you got some of these wrong, be careful that you

15
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:04,605
weren't looking at the b or the y intercept. The y intercept doesn't determine

16
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:08,856
whether or not lines are perpendicular or parallel. It's only the slope, the m.
