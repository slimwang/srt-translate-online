00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,050
Hi, my name is Lorenzo, and
I'll be your instructor as we

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,780
explore the foundations of
full stack web development.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,010
In this course you will learn to build
your own data-driven web application,

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,630
but what does that actually mean?

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,260
Well, when I say web application
I'm referring to a web page or

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,890
collection of pages that allows your
browser to respond to user input,

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,608
similar to an offline
software application.

8
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:23,160
And by data-driven,
I mean an application that can store and

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,890
retrieve information from a database to
deliver customized content to the user.

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,140
Almost all of the popular websites
you interact with on a daily basis

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,080
are data-driven web applications.

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,660
Soon you will create a similar
website of your own.

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,700
In addition to creating web pages, you
will also learn to send data from your

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,150
server in other forms,
like JSON requests.

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,010
So that the data from your application
can be shared with other machines that

16
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,660
process JSON, like a data aggregator or
a mobile device.

17
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,463
Your mission in this course is
to help me create a menu app.

18
00:00:50,463 --> 00:00:53,805
You'll be building an interactive
web application that presents a user

19
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:57,920
a variety of menu items they can view,
create, modify, and delete.

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,770
In the first lesson of this course
you will extract data from a database

21
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,295
using Python.

22
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:05,209
We'll also be using a tool called
an object-relational mapping, or

23
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,720
ORM to manipulate queries
as objects in Python.

24
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,860
If you've never heard of an ORM,
don't worry.

25
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,730
You'll be very familiar with
it in just a few minutes.

26
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,640
In the second lesson you will build
your first data-driven web application

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,330
using only the libraries that
come installed with Python.

28
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,790
In the third lesson we will
talk about frameworks and

29
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,220
create an application using
the lightweight web framework, Flask.

30
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,020
You will understand how frameworks help
developers write code more efficiently.

31
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,945
Once you complete this course you
will easily be able to compare and

32
00:01:32,945 --> 00:01:36,140
contrast frameworks, and choose one
of your own for future projects.

33
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,918
Finally, you'll use what you
learned from lessons one, two, and

34
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:42,420
three to iteratively write code until
you have a polished menu application,

35
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,300
complete with API endpoints for
JSON requests.

36
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:45,910
Let's get started.
