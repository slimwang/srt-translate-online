Hey Suzanne, what are you doing?

2
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:03,889
>> I'm just taking a look at our app,
and

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,009
it looks a bit weird
on this tablet screen.

4
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:08,589
>> Yeah, it seems like there's a lot
of blank spaces on the sides here.

5
00:00:08,589 --> 00:00:11,730
>> I think it would look better
if I could change this layout and

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,570
maybe add some padding.

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,149
>> Well, Android actually
makes this pretty easy for us.

8
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,109
We can include different layout
files for different screen sizes and

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,919
orientations.

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,665
>> That's right.

11
00:00:20,664 --> 00:00:24,259
We'll just need to create another
layout file for this tablet size.

12
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,679
And Android let's us create these
files for specific screen sizes or

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:28,820
configurations.

14
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,980
Which we'll learn more about next.
