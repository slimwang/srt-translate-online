1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,830
>> You ready for a quiz?

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:01,550
>> Yes, I am.

3
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,090
>> Okay. Here's what I'd like you to do. I'd like

4
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,290
you to use these probabilities that we have written down here,

5
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,180
that, that constitute the joint distribution of, when you look out

6
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,310
do you see a storm, do you see lightning? And use these

7
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,300
numbers to answer some other questions that aren't directly in here

8
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,650
but you can figure it out. So, the first one is to

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,190
say, what's the probability when you look out the window at

10
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,088
2 PM in the summer, in Atlanta, that there's no storm, okay?

11
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:25,080
>> Okay. And, then the question is to say,

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,940
what's the probability that if there is

13
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,360
a storm, there is also lightning, okay? So

14
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,970
the probability of lightning given that there

15
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,652
is a storm. And we've done some stuff

16
00:00:33,652 --> 00:00:35,790
with conditional probability. So these concepts should

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,110
be familiar with you, but you should be

18
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,030
able to connect it up with, you know, the numbers in the table. You ready?

19
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:40,562
>> I am ready.

20
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:40,790
>> Go.
