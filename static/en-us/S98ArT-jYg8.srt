1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,755
Accountable care organizations are a key
feature of the new Affordable Care Act,

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:10,210
whose design is in part derived from
the PGP demo we just discussed.

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,940
There are currently a few hundred
ACOs being formed, or in operation.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:20,987
32 select pioneer ACOs are piloting
an even more advanced approach.

5
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:26,087
Like the Marshville Clinic,
pioneer ACOs must use advanced health

6
00:00:26,087 --> 00:00:30,650
IT to manage entire populations
of patients in a coordinated

7
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,620
manner to electronically
exchange healthcare data.

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,230
They must have the ability to
share performance feedback.

9
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,010
They must provide a portal providing
access to patients to their own data.

10
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,040
And they must have a demonstrated
ability to coordinate care.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,190
So which of the following is
the most advanced approach

12
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,314
to pay-for-performance?
