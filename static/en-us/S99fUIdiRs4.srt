00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,172
Let's continue writing some equations, but this time, let's try generating

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:08,351
equations from words instead of a graph. I want you to write the equation above

3
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:12,381
line that has a slope of negative 2 and that passes through the point 0 negative

4
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:16,798
4. Think about what this point is and think about slope-intercept form. I think

5
00:00:16,798 --> 00:00:20,333
you'll be able to figure out. You can write your equation here.
