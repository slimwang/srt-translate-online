00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,930
Just like we want compatible attributes for

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,960
a persona, we also want use cases that

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,000
make sense with our persona. So let's go

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,730
over two use cases for Dorm Room Debbie.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,410
So remember, a use case is the how, when and where, Debbie would use our pizza

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,100
application to order pizza. So one example might

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,013
be, she's going to order pizza at 4 am.

8
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:20,850
>> Right.

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,760
>> Another example would be, that she might

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,340
order a big group order with her friends.

11
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,740
So these two use cases are consistent with Dorm Room Debbie's persona. Can you

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,300
come up with another use case that would make sense for Dorm Room Debbie?
