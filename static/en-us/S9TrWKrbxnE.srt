1
00:00:00,175 --> 00:00:01,929
In a final exercise,

2
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,321
I'd like you to scatter plot

3
00:00:03,321 --> 00:00:05,611
the data that is modified,

4
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:07,592
by modifying two of those prices,

5
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:10,311
and please again, plot the data,

6
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:12,406
and answer for me the question,

7
00:00:12,406 --> 00:00:15,288
whether you can fit a line, or for differently,

8
00:00:15,288 --> 00:00:16,929
"is this linear?"

9
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:20,929
I really want you to go with a piece of paper to draw those points.
