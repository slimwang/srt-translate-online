00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,436
Emotions can help us in the process of our ability to remember through both

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:07,780
genetic processes, as well as biochemical processes. In fact, when we

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,710
experience an emotional event, it can actually cause a change in our genetics.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,358
Such that they build proteins and strengthen synaptic connections between

5
00:00:16,358 --> 00:00:22,166
neurons. We discuss this in detail in Lesson 3. So proteins stimulate the

6
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:27,039
formation of new synapses and even new neurons. This results in our ability to

7
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,526
make memories last for longer periods of time. On the biochemical side, the

8
00:00:31,526 --> 00:00:36,825
neurotransmitter, norepinephirine is important for the formation of memories.

9
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:41,832
Because it strengthens the synaptic connection between neurons. Remember that

10
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:46,179
neuroplasticity is necessary for making the connection between synapses

11
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:51,732
stronger, and thus make an event more memorable. One other variable that

12
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:56,860
affects our memory is sleep. Sleep can help us consolidate our memories.

13
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,325
Remember, however, from information that we previously discussed in this

14
00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:04,860
lesson, that our memories are not always perfectly correct. We know that

15
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,413
emotions can actually distort memories. In fact, it appears that emotional

16
00:01:09,413 --> 00:01:14,684
memories tend to be less accurate in details than nonemotional memories.
