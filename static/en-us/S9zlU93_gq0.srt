00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,850
So as I said these operations are easy in 1D and a little trickier in 2D, and

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,290
of course it doesnt work at all if you have sharp shape variations.

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,700
So here is a shape example I think also done by Ted Abelson.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,010
So here we have this sharp shape boundary right here, and

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,730
the question is what is the relationship between these, this square and

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,780
that square and actually you can take a look at these edges.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,010
Right? Well, you realize that these two are the same.

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:38,210
And yet this square probably looks darker to you than that square.

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,100
And in fact, here we go again.

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,550
You can see that there's not boundary here, and there's no boundary there.

11
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,010
These two squares are the same intensity,

12
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,886
which by the way are the same intensity as that.

13
00:00:49,886 --> 00:00:50,605
All right?

14
00:00:50,605 --> 00:00:57,080
So rednex would fail here because it would assume that this sharp boundary

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,470
was due to change in an object and not due to change in an illumination.

16
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,190
because when you have a sharp shape change you have

17
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,890
a sharp illumination change and rednex doesn't deal with that at all.

18
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,340
So what's going on here is refered to as sometimes as color constancy or

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,390
lightness constancy.
