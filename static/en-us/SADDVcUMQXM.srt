00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,698
>> Well now the range is 10 million minus 21,180. This makes the range

00:00:05,698 --> 00:00:12,435
9,978,820. That's a lot bigger than this range, just because we added one extra

3
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:19,337
datum. Mark Zuckerburg is an outlier, and this significantly increases the range

4
00:00:19,337 --> 00:00:24,344
of our data. In general, outliers increase the variability, but way too much

5
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:29,111
when we use the range as our measure. Therefore, the range may not accurately

6
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:33,879
represent the variability of data, especially in the presence of outliers.
