00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here's another nearest neighbor example, and now I'm going to ask a different question.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Given all the black data points,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I want to make sure that the red ones are classified as indicated

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and I am free to choose a different value for K.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Say I can choose K to be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Check any or all of the K values

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
for which you believe these 3 data points

8
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
are classified correctly relative to the black training data set.
