00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,850
Let's look at the solution to our tree height reduction quiz. We had this code,

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,110
and we are trying to transform it through tree height reduction into something

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,960
that minimizes the overall number of cycles it takes to execute this code.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,280
Here, the code takes six cycles to do because each of the instructions depends

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,770
on the previous one. Now, when doing tree height reduction, what we need to do

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,950
is really figure out what is the expression that this is trying to compute. And

7
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,980
then, rewrite that expression. So, here's what we have here. We have R1 plus R2.

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:42,370
Put the result in R10. Then subtract R3. Then add R4.

9
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:47,910
Then subtract R5. Then add R6. Then subtract R7.

10
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,850
So this is what we are trying to compute. How do we compute it with tree height

11
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:59,350
reduction? Well, the idea is to compute R1 and R2. That's what we're doing here.

12
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,910
And then, compute the rest of the things and then add them up in R3.

13
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:08,250
So here, what we need to do is we need to add up four numbers and then

14
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,640
subtract three numbers from that. So first, we will add up the four numbers.

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,110
We already added up R1 and R2. Now we're going to add up R4 and R6. Next,

16
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:25,490
the result of our two additions are going to be combined. So

17
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,970
we're going to add up what we have for R1 and R2 and what we have for R4 and R6.

18
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,250
So now in R10 we have the R1 plus R2 plus R4 plus R6.

19
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,036
Now we're going to subtract R3, R5 and

20
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:42,690
R7 from it. If we do it one at a time, that's going to be slow. So

21
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:49,000
what we are going to do is we are going to add up R3, R5 and R7 and

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,990
then subtract that from our R10. That's why we ave two adds here.

23
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,550
So clearly, what we are doing here is we are simply adding up R3, R5. And

24
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:05,040
then R7 is added to that. So this needs to be R11.

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,330
So now R11 has R3 plus R5 plus R7. And

26
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:17,220
now we subtract that from R10, and we get the final answer in R10.

27
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,440
Now let us see how many cycles we need to do this. To do that,

28
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,920
let's draw the dependencies. Here we have the dependence again. Like this.

29
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,310
So each instruction needed to be done right after the previous one is done.

30
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:36,980
Here there is no dependence between these two. There is a dependence here and

31
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,850
here. So the third instruction is to wait for the first two to complete.

32
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:46,260
There is now, no dependence here. So this one can be done right away,

33
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,550
even though it's the fourth instruction in our code. And

34
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:54,210
then there is a dependence here. And then finally, there is a dependence here,

35
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:59,140
and also our final R10 here needs to be brought this way.

36
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,090
So, if you look at what can be done in the first cycle, this can be done in

37
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,890
the first cycle, and so can this. This cannot because it has to wait. This can.

38
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,660
So this is also done in the first cycle. And then, this has to wait for that and

39
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,380
so on. So in our first cycle, we've already done three instructions,

40
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,670
half of the instructions that we had. In the second cycle, we can do this,

41
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,560
because these two complete in the first cycle. We can do this. Because it

42
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,830
only waits for this and that's been done. And, finally, in the third cycle we

43
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,593
have to do this because it has to wait for the results of the second cycle. So

44
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:38,878
we have completed our six instructions now in three cycles and we've got

45
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:44,602
an ILP of 2, which is twice as good as we had before the tree height reduction.
