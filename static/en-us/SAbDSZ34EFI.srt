00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I want to close with some general comments about the uses of models and simulation.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
All simulation of Apollo 13 is just one example of what can be done with these techniques

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
from mathematics and computer science.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
These techniques allow us to do experiments that can't be done in real life.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
They may be too expensive in real life.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
For instance, building 1000 cars to find the right aerodynamic shape.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
They may be too dangerous.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
For instance, if we ask the astronauts to actually try out different boost

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
or they may be outright impossible--for instance, we want to look at the universe

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that has different fundamental constants of nature.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We may use simulations for simple prediction, for optimization, to study causes and effects

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
for instance of earthquakes or climate change,

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and we may use models and simulation to determine unobservable quantities

14
00:00:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
such as the composition of the interior of the earth.
