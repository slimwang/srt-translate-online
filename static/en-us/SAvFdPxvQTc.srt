00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,820
>> Cameron just showed you how to solve problems based on solutions developed by

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,551
other people.

3
00:00:04,551 --> 00:00:06,903
Now this is a common practice in web development.

4
00:00:06,903 --> 00:00:08,256
So let's ask Jacques and

5
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:12,320
see how he approaches problem solving in his everyday work.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,258
I've got this broccoli stuffed animal.

7
00:00:14,258 --> 00:00:15,961
Let's see if we can get his attention.

8
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:26,044
>> So problem solving on the web is not exactly fun.

9
00:00:26,044 --> 00:00:28,423
But when you run into an issue with HTML or CSS,

10
00:00:28,423 --> 00:00:32,327
the chances that somebody else has run into that same issue are pretty good,

11
00:00:32,327 --> 00:00:34,404
especially when you're starting out.

12
00:00:34,404 --> 00:00:38,080
So checking sites like Stack Overflow.

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,060
Searching around on the web for

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,780
sort of the same type of problem you're experiencing.

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,813
This doesn't fit over that.

16
00:00:44,813 --> 00:00:47,680
Why is this shifting down below here?

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,150
Those sorts of things will most times yield the answer you're looking for.

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,360
One of the great things about the fact that there are so many people doing web

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,610
development is that those people run into the same types of problems.

20
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,960
So go check Stack Overflow.

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,970
Go check out the web.

22
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,210
You can probably find the answer that you're looking for.
