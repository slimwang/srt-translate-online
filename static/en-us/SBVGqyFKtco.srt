1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,600
So, here is our plan for the project. I will

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,530
start with step one, which is reading text. Now, here is

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,930
the file I want to check for curse words. For

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,790
now, I have some famous movie quotes in here. By the

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,640
way, this file could have contained some other text, like

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,350
the draft of an email or an article you wrote. I

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,210
have named this file movie_quotes.txt. Now, if you want to use

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,330
this exact file in this program. It is available for you

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,970
to download in the instructor notes. But you should

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,900
feel free to use any other text file on your

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,470
computer as well. Okay, let's start writing code. Now,

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,830
I created a program called check_profanity.py. You could have called

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,730
it something else as well. Inside it, I created

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,610
a function called read_text, which is empty for now. Now,

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,290
I know there is this function in Python called open,

16
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,260
which allows you to work with files on your computer.

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:56,010
This function takes in the address or the location of the file you want to open.

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,780
So, on a Windows machine, I will browse

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,980
to my file, which is movie_quotes.txt. Copy its location.

20
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,500
Paste that. And then add the file name

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:14,360
I want to open, which is movie_quotes.txt. Now,

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,830
if you're on a Mac, there is a helpful document in the instructor notes for you.

23
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,450
That document will tell you how to get the location of this file on a Mac.

24
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,700
I will refer to this file as quotes.

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,420
Now that I have a way of accessing movie_quotes.txt,

26
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,920
I will use a function called read. So,

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,320
I will say, quotes.read. This will allow me

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,290
to read the contents of movie_quotes. So, let

29
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,790
me save that in a variable called contents_of_file. Let

30
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,690
me print out those contents. And it's also

31
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,340
a good convention to close out any file that

32
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,320
we've opened through the program. Okay. Now, I'm

33
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,600
going to save and run this program and see

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,299
where it gets us.

35
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,400
And boom. Here is that output window with all

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,380
of the movie quotes that we had read from the

37
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,490
text file. Now, I don't know about you. But

38
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,508
it just blows my mind that we can read from

39
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:12,720
a text file with only a few lines of

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,570
code. Okay, so I am back at our program. Now,

41
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,880
before I continue to execute any more of plan. Let's

42
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,750
find out a bit more about this function called open.
