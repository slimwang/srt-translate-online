1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,590
The principal components analysis that I'm doing happens to live in

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:03,880
this function called doPCA.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,090
And it looks very familiar to a lot of the stuff we've done

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,540
before in scikit-learn.

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,770
You have an import statement where you

6
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,630
actually get the module out that has the code that you want.

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,910
You create, in this case, the principal components analysis.

8
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:16,820
You fit it.

9
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,350
And then you can return that as an object.

10
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,490
And so what I do is I, I get my principal components that, analysis that way.

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,060
And I can ask some very interesting,

12
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,750
some very important questions of it by accessing the attributes.

13
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,540
So let's explain these three lines.

14
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,420
This is how I actually get the information out of my PCA object.

15
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,910
The first, the explained variance ratio is actually where the eigenvalues live.

16
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,220
So by printing out this, this line here.

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,230
This is the way that I know that the first principle component has about 90,

18
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,100
91 percent of the variation in the data, and the second one has about 9, or

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,200
10 percent.

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,720
Those numbers come from this statement.

21
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,190
And then the second thing that I do is I look at the first and

22
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,040
second principle components.

23
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,770
I get these out of the components attribute of my PCA object.

24
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,290
So the components is going to be a list,

25
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,870
a Python list that has as many principle components in it.

26
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,850
As I ask for as a parameter.

27
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,930
So in that case, I have two principal components that I'm getting.

28
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,320
So I name them the first and second pc.

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,390
So in previous quizzes where we were talking about,

30
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,020
what's the direction in of, say, x prime in the xy original feature space,

31
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,290
we came up with two numbers that were sort of packaged together into a vector.

32
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,210
You can access that directional information through these components.

33
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,260
Once I've fit my principle components analysis I have to,

34
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,150
in order to do anything, perform something like a transformation of the data.

35
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,990
And this code I will just give you in the starter code for the quiz.

36
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,600
What I'm doing here is, I'm visualizing it.

37
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,010
The first line is in red.

38
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,050
I'll be plotting the first principle component,

39
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,450
the locations of all the points along that principle component.

40
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,650
As well as the direction of the principle components.

41
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,940
I'm accessing that information by using the elements of the first PC vector.

42
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,370
Then in Cyan or kind of a teal color, I'll be accessing the second

43
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,670
principle component, and in blue I have the original data.

44
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,760
So let me show you what this looks like,

45
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,830
and then you give it a try yourself in the quiz.

46
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,130
The first thing that you get is that you print out the eigenvalues.

47
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,770
Remember that's this explained variance ratio information.

48
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,180
And then the second thing is that you'll get a scatter plot.

49
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,250
And it should look something like this.

50
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,130
So you remember the red was the direction of our first principle component.

51
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,040
And that's hopefully exactly where you guessed it was.

52
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,600
Certainly intuitively seems like it's in the right place.

53
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,220
The cyan is perpendicular to that.

54
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,360
And then the blue is the original data points.

55
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,300
One thing that I'll add is that it looks to the eye like the red and

56
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,750
the cyan are not perfectly orthogonal.

57
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,470
This doesn't quite look like a 90 degree angle.

58
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,870
But remember that our axis have different scales.

59
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,850
That this one goes all the way out to ten million,

60
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,650
the y axis only goes out to less than half of that, about four million.

61
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,010
So, in reality, if we were to plot everything proportionally,

62
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,050
this graph should be twice as long as it is tall.

63
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,430
And if we were to visualize it in exactly that way, they would be orthogonal
