1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,331
First, I'm going to change the app so
when you hit the Order button,

2
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:05,960
it's going to show Amount Due $10 or
whatever the price is.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,220
Since there's going to be a lot of
combinations where I'm going to need

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,620
the price, I'm just going to create
an integer variable to hold the price.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,310
Notice that the int is lowercase i
because it's a primitive data type.

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,640
Now I can just refer to the price
variable whenever I want

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,650
the price number.

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,506
Now, I need to change the string so
it says Amount Due.

9
00:00:27,506 --> 00:00:32,020
So, I'm going to write "Amount Due ",
add a space,

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,870
and then concatenate that
with the price variable.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,760
Oh, and
I forgot the dollar sign as well.

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,920
The dollar sign should be part
of this string literal, and

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,200
I want it to be after a space,
so I'll put it right here.

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,900
Now I'm going to run it.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,800
If I change quantity to three and

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,730
then hit the Order button,
then it correctly shows Amount Due $15.

17
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,700
First one done, that wasn't too bad.

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,290
Next, we want it to say
that would be $10, please.

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,640
I'm going to change this text to
start with That would be, and then

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,966
I want a dollar sign, the price, and
then I want some more text after that.

21
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:15,070
I should say " please" and a period.

22
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,840
I add a space here because I
want a space after the price.

23
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,310
Let's check to see what that looks like.

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,520
On the device,
if I change quantity to three,

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,490
hit the Order button,
it says That would be $15 please.

26
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,290
Now the second one's done.

27
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,570
We're on a roll.

28
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,537
The third one says,
You owe 10 bucks, dude!

29
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:39,409
I'm going to change the start of
this string to be You owe, and

30
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:45,354
then I'm going to remove the dollar
sign because we just need the price,

31
00:01:45,354 --> 00:01:49,456
and then we're going to add " bucks,
dude!".

32
00:01:49,456 --> 00:01:50,628
That looks correct.

33
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:51,130
Let's run that.

34
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,990
I'm going to hit the Order button.

35
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,270
It says, You owe 15 bucks, dude!

36
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,330
The fourth one is a little tricky.

37
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,160
We want to say 10 dollars for
2 cups of coffee.

38
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,310
Pay up.

39
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,710
I see a need for two variables here,
the price variable and

40
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,580
the quantity variable.

41
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,979
We're going to start with the price,
which is ten.

42
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:14,624
And then we're going to
say " dollars for ", and

43
00:02:14,624 --> 00:02:20,211
then I need to put the quantity and
then " cups of coffee.

44
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:22,416
And then Pay up.".

45
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,070
Let's run that.

46
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,160
If I hit the Order button, then it
says 15 dollars for 3 cups of coffee.

47
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,980
Pay up.

48
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,590
That looks really good.

49
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,170
This was tricky because we
had two variables here,

50
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,070
concatenated with two string literals.

51
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,900
Fortunately, we added spaces
in the right place so

52
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,750
that it would look
like a normal sentence.

53
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,800
That was the hardest one, and now we can
do the last one, that says Total: $10.

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,370
I'm going to erase this
whole thing here, and

55
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,520
say "Total: " and then the price.

56
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,370
Oh, but I also need the dollar sign, so

57
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,815
I'm going to put that
inside the string literal.

58
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,990
Oh, and I forgot the plus sign, too.

59
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,491
There, now let's run the app.

60
00:03:05,491 --> 00:03:11,215
I change quantity to three, hit Order,
then it correctly says Total: $15.

61
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:12,440
Woo hoo!

62
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,650
You got through all of these different
combinations of string concatenation

63
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,140
with variables.

64
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,340
Now move on to the next video for
your last coding task of this lesson.
