Here's an idea for
a graph partitioning heuristic.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,400
Use breadth first search or BFS.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,340
In the following box I
want you to tell me how.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,420
That is I want you to sketch
an algorithm that uses BFS and

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,160
type that algorithm here.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,250
If it helps assume that
the input graph is connected,

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,010
meaning you can assume there's a path
from every vertex to every other vertex.

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,460
I know what you're thinking, why do
I have to do all the hard work and

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,430
explain this to you?

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,960
Isn't that your job?

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,540
Oh, quit your whining, you big baby,
and just answer the question.
