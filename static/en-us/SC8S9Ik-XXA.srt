1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,310
So here is a private key crypto system in action. Two entities, A

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,700
and B, have exchanged keys. A will use the key KA to

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:16,140
send a message to B, and B can decrypt the message

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,990
using the same key KA. And similarly, when

5
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,940
B wants to send a message to A it encrypts it lets say using

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:31,700
another private key key B and when the message comes over here A will decrypt

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:37,960
the message using the same key that was used for encryption namely key B. So one

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,020
of the things that should be obvious is

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,120
that, in order for this private key encryption

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,620
system to work, both the entities need to

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,160
know when they get an encrypted message who

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,590
is the author of the message, because that is the only way they know what key to

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,550
use in order to decrypt this message. So

14
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,950
if a sends a message to b,it's sending this

15
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,550
encrypted message. When this cyphertext arrives here, for

16
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,300
B to know that it has to use this

17
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,410
key KA, it needs to know the identity of

18
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,480
the sender. So the identity of the sender has

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,250
to be sent in cleartext. So this is the format of a message that is going from A

20
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:26,240
to B. The identity of the sender in cleartext Meaning that, looking at

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,390
this, we will immediately know, this message is from sender A, and

22
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,520
therefore, I should use key k A to decrypt the cyphertext, and

23
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,610
vice versa when A gets a message from B. Of course, k A and

24
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,160
k B can be the same, or in other words, it is the same key that is used

25
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,810
for, A to send a message to B as well as for B to send a message to

26
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,770
A. But the important thing to take away is

27
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,620
that the key that is used for encryption and

28
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,300
decryption of a given message is exactly the same,

29
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,560
that's the idea behind the private key encryption system.
