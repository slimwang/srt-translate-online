>> So we know functions are a special relationship between a set of inputs and a

2
00:00:04,737 --> 00:00:09,362
set of outputs. This can work for objects and it can also work for numbers.

3
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:14,044
Here's a set of numbers and here's another set of numbers. When we think of a

4
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:18,452
coordinate point, we usually think of the x as the input and the y as the

5
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:23,648
output. So these would be inputs, and these would be the corresponding outputs.

6
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:28,473
Knowing that information, is this set of order pairs a function? And is this set

7
00:00:28,473 --> 00:00:33,096
of ordered pairs a function? Write yes or no in these boxes. As a hint, make a

8
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:37,832
list of the inputs and the outputs, just like before, and then draw the arrows

9
00:00:37,832 --> 00:00:39,622
to map it out. Try your best.
