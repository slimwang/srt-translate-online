1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,360
The framework vendors however had made some

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,870
design decisions that differentiate their approaches.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,830
For example, they often differ on memory management.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,710
Java and CLR provide garbage collection, COM provides reference counting, and

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,170
CORBA doesn't provide anything at all.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,480
As far as container managed persistence is concerned,

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,060
Java has Enterprise Java Beans.

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,950
CORBA has CCM, but CLR and Compost don't provide anything.

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,645
The vendors also have various approaches for the versioning,

10
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:36,150
some of them freeze, some of them have version numbers, some of them have

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,750
compatibility rules, and some of them allow for side-by-side execution.

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,700
Some other differences include the target environment for

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,800
the component frameworks.

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,670
J2EE and COM target servers.

15
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,590
COM also targets client and

16
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,720
desktop machines, whereas CORBA targets legacy applications.

17
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,625
They all also differ in terms of their development environments.

18
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:03,790
J(2)EE uses WebSphere, which is the commercial version of Eclipse.

19
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,570
And .NET uses Visual Studio .NET.

20
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,320
As far as protocols are concerned, Java and CORBA support IIOP and XML.

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,650
Java supports, also supports RMI.

22
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,290
COM and CLR support DCOM.

23
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,890
And CLR supports XML and SOAP.
