Now that you've seen some of the quirks of

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:04,240
math and Java, and why they happen, it's time to

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,780
practice writing your own Java expressions for math calculations.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,850
We started a class for you that has a method

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,410
for each of these expressions. Can you fill in

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,780
the Java code for each of the methods? There's a

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,480
test program you can run to test your work
