1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,413
This ellipse would be centered at negative 2 negative 3 would have an a value

2
00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:11,324
of 4 and a, b value of 2. Great work if you found all 3. For the center we take

3
00:00:11,324 --> 00:00:16,548
the opposite signs of what's next the x and the y in the parenthesis. Ellipse

4
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:20,895
so for x we'll have negative 2 for the x coordinate at the center and negative

5
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:26,673
3 for the y coordinate of the center. Remember this really shifts an ellipse

6
00:00:26,673 --> 00:00:31,526
centered at the origin two units left and then three units down. So, this is

7
00:00:31,526 --> 00:00:36,124
how we know our center is here. Next we take the square root of 16, which is

8
00:00:36,124 --> 00:00:40,637
our a value. Remember a squared is always underneath the x squared term for

9
00:00:40,637 --> 00:00:45,451
ellipses. And to find b, we take the square root of the denominator of the y

10
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:51,288
term. So, the square root of 4 equals 2. From our center we can move four units

11
00:00:51,288 --> 00:00:56,238
left and right to get these two points on our ellipse. And from our center we

12
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:01,366
can move two units up and down to get two additional points on our ellipse. And

13
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:04,694
if we look closely at the points that are vertically aligned with the center,

14
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:07,866
we can see that one point is two units above the center and another point is

15
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:10,910
two units below the center.
