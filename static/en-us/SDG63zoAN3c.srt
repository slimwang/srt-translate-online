Okay, Michael. Here's a problem I want you to solve. Let's imagine we have

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,020
two points. I'm going to call them X and Y, just so I can confuse

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,880
you with notation. And they are both two dimensional points. So they're in a

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,400
plane. And they have components X1 and X2 and components Y1 and Y2. Okay?

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,690
>> Sure.

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,940
>> And rather than computing the X transpose Y, their dot

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:26,350
product, I want to compute the dot product of those two points,

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,560
but passed through this function phi, or phi. You got it?

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,640
>> Yeah. Okay, so. X transpose Y, gets turned into phi X transpose phi Y.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,310
What's the answer? What's the output? In terms of X1, X2, Y1, Y2. Go.
