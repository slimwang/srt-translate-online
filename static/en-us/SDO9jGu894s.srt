1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,250
Okay, the answer should be 1. Here's how we figure that out. I know as I go from

2
00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:10,250
27 to 9, I divide by 3, and then to get to 9 to 3, I divide by another 3. So to

3
00:00:10,262 --> 00:00:15,200
find 3 to the zero, I need to take my number and divide it again by 3, 3 divided

4
00:00:15,212 --> 00:00:19,670
by 3 makes 1. That's how I know 3 to the zero is 1. It turns out that this is

5
00:00:19,682 --> 00:00:24,123
true for any power of zero. Okay, I've re-drawn my pattern of 2. I know as the

6
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:28,995
exponent decreases, this number also decreases. To get from 8 to 4, I divided by

7
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:33,248
2. This should make sense because I know exponents represent repeated

8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,137
multiplication. So to drop one exponent, I need to undo multiplication I need to

9
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:39,169
do Division.

10
00:00:39,174 --> 00:00:43,867
And then to get from 42, I divide by 2 again. So, I know to get from 2, 2 to the

11
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,361
0, I have to divide by 2 one more time. I have to drop my exponent one. I have

12
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:51,610
to undo multiplication, so I do division, and I get one.
