1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,110
OK, so how do we figure this out?

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,350
>> Cleverly, so I, when I, when I see things

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,640
like this, I just like to be methodical, so why don't

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,740
we just be methodical so, I'm going to ask the question

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,120
whether the vc dimension is at least one, because it's pretty

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,660
easy to think about and maybe I'll get a feel

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,490
for how to get the right answer that way. OK, so

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,062
is the vs dimension at least one? Well, the answer

9
00:00:23,062 --> 00:00:25,319
is pretty clearly yes, so if you just put a dot

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,370
on the number line somewhere. You could, yeah like that. You could

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,770
label it positive just by picking any a less than or equal

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,880
to that point and any b greater than or equal to that

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,690
point. So, if, if I were like drawing parentheses or something to

14
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,442
indicate the interval, I could just put parenthesis around the point and

15
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:50,068
that will give me a plus or brackets, that would be fine.

16
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:53,650
Okay, so that's that's pretty easy. And if I wanted it to

17
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,780
be negative, I could just put both of the brackets on either

18
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,260
side of the point, it doesn't matter, let's say to the left.

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,340
Alright, that make sense Michael?

20
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,870
>> That's exactly what I was thinking about, yeah.

21
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,220
Though I would've put the brackets on the right.

22
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,100
>> Yeah, you would. okay, so then

23
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,620
we could see...do the same argument for, see

24
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,350
if the VC dimension is greater than or equal to two. So if I put two

25
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,062
points on the line, so there are

26
00:01:15,062 --> 00:01:18,960
only,there're four possibilities I gotta get. Plus plus,

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,360
minus plus, plus minus, and minus minus. Okay,

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,400
so we gotta get plus plus, plus minus,

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,870
minus plus and minus minus. So, the, the first and the

30
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,360
last one are really easy. Actually they're all easy but you

31
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,122
can definitely do this. So, if you want to get plus

32
00:01:33,122 --> 00:01:35,723
plus, you just need to put brackets so that they surround the

33
00:01:35,723 --> 00:01:39,460
two points, that's good. If you want to get plus minus you

34
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,240
put the left bracket in the same place and you put the

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,450
right bracket just to the right of the point, yeah, and

36
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,510
you do the same thing for minus plus and then for minus

37
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:54,160
minus you put the brackets on either side of both of the points and

38
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,195
so, since you like it to the right I'm going to put em to the left.

39
00:01:57,195 --> 00:02:00,410
>> [LAUGH] Good.

40
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,060
>> And there you go, that was, that was pretty easy I think. Okay so next

41
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,480
we need to figure out whether the VC dimensions at least three. So we need three

42
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,900
dots on a line, three, distinct dots on

43
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,170
a line. And we've got eight possibilities but

44
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,550
Michael I don't want you to write down

45
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,660
those, those eight possiblities because I think I see

46
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,130
an easy way to answer the question right away.

47
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:17,520
>> Excellent

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,500
>> So, this is a lot like the last

49
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,830
example we did with, with the theta. Except now.

50
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,930
>> Yeah.

51
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,560
>> We only have two parameters. And the problem with had with the theta was

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,940
that as we moved the theta over, from left to right, we lost the ability

53
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,080
to, to, to have a, a, a positive followed by a, a negative. So I

54
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,980
think there's a similar thing here. So,

55
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,160
if you label those three points this way.

56
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,590
Plus, minus, and plus. I don't, I don't think you can

57
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,660
do that, and that's because in order to get point one

58
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,550
and point three in the interval, you're going to have to put

59
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,450
the brackets on both sides of them. So you're going to have

60
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,860
to put a, a left bracket to the left of the

61
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,750
first point and a right bracket to the right of the

62
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,920
third point. And that's the only way to make those two

63
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,140
plus. But then you're always going to capture the one in the middle.

64
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,240
So you can't actually shatter three points, with this hypothesis class.

65
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,510
>> Now, you have to argue though, that

66
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,220
there isn't some other way you could arrange the

67
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,550
three points. I don't know like, I don't know,

68
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,060
stacking them on top of each other or something.

69
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,800
>> You mean vertically on top of one each other?

70
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,050
>> Yeah.

71
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,840
>> Well then they wouldn't be in R, they'd be in R2.

72
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,940
>> Well no, just like right on top of each other.

73
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,110
>> Well then they're all the same point.

74
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,180
>> And you

75
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,120
can't label them. Again, you have the same problem that you can't label one of

76
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,440
them negative and the other ones positive if they're all on top of each other.

77
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:35,600
>> Right.

78
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,340
>> So, so there isn't, there just isn't any way to set up

79
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,330
these three points so that you're able to assign them all possible labels.

80
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:42,780
>> Right.

81
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,560
>> So, good, so that gives us two as our answer here.

82
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,650
So, by the way, I think that you said something I think that's

83
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:53,040
really important. In order to prove the lower bound, in order to prove

84
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,210
one and two, all we had to do was come up with an

85
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,210
example where we could chatter, right?

86
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,762
>> Yes, that's exactly right.

87
00:03:58,762 --> 00:04:01,690
>> Right, so so that's good and that's

88
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,940
that's really nice because otherwise we're in a

89
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,880
heap of trouble [LAUGH] if we have to

90
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,710
show that you can shatter every single thing. We

91
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,890
just have to show that you can shatter

92
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,180
one thing. So, it exists. So that whole VC

93
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,320
dimension is really a...there exists some set of

94
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,300
points you can shatter, not you can shatter everything.

95
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,620
>> That's right, and what would be an example of points that you couldn't

96
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,780
shatter yeah, a pair of points that you couldn't shatter?

97
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,540
>> Well, the ones on top of one another.

98
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,980
>> Yeah, exactly, because you wouldn't

99
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,170
be able to assign them different labels.

100
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:28,500
>> Right.

101
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,800
>> So that would be a really bad choice,

102
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,400
and here all we need is a good choice.

103
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,960
>> Right. So, if you make good choices you can

104
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,340
shatter things, which sounds more violent than I intended. Okay

105
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,120
but, in the third case of the VC dimension, it

106
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,580
wasn't enough to show an example that you couldn't shatter, because,

107
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,690
then you could do the same thing as you

108
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,050
point out, with a VC dimension of two. Instead you

109
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,240
have to prove that no example exists. So, there does

110
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,620
not exist or a for all not word or something.

111
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,060
>> For all, not.

112
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,980
>> [LAUGH] Exactly. So, that, that's a, that's an interesting set of set of

113
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,170
requirements there, right? So, proving a lower

114
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,730
bound seems easier than proving an upper bound.

115
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,950
>> Though it's interesting cause in this case, in cases

116
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,360
one and two, you had to show that all the

117
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,840
different combinations were covered, whereas in this last case we

118
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,810
just had to give one combination that couldn't possibly be covered.

119
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,790
>> Yeah, but it couldn't possibly be covered no matter

120
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,720
what we did. No matter what the input arrangement was.

121
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,000
>> Right.

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,720
>> Yeah.

123
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,300
>> Whereas in the first case, I had to show all possibilities.

124
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,170
I mean, you know, all possible labelings but only for one example

125
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,180
of orderings or one collection of points. So just messily

126
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,570
doing some bad predicate calculus to, nail down what you're saying.

127
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,320
That when we say that the answer is yes, we're

128
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,370
saying that there exists a set of points of a certain

129
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,270
size, since that for all labelings, no matter how we,

130
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,940
we want to label it. There is some hypothesis that works for

131
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,850
that labeling. But to say no, we have to do

132
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,670
the legation of that which is not exist for all exist.

133
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,000
Which, by standard logic rules says that, that means

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,860
for all points, no matter how you arrange the

135
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,390
points, it's not the case that for all labels.

136
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,130
There exists hypothesis which again DeMorgan's Law its not against

137
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,590
DeMorgan's Law to to apply this idea that says

138
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,220
that's the same as for all arrangements of points

139
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,900
there's some labeling where there's no hypothesis that's going

140
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,350
to work and that's exactly how you made your argument.

141
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,340
>> Huh, except I didn't use DeMorgan's Law and

142
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,120
upside down a's and backwards z's. Oh you did, oh you did.

143
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,300
>> Hm. I am the [INAUDIBLE] powerful.
