00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,836
Let's see how you did. The x intercept for this equation is 3, 0 and the y

2
00:00:05,836 --> 00:00:12,492
intercept is 0, negative 6. Let's see how we got those answers. Remember when we

3
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:18,534
are finding an x intercept we set the y value to 0. When we set y equal to 0 in

4
00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:25,146
this equation we get. 2x minus 0 equals 6. Which is the same as 2x equals 6. And

5
00:00:25,146 --> 00:00:31,460
if we divide both sides by 2 we get x equals 3. So the x intercept is going to

6
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,429
be 3 comma zero. To find the y intercept we want to set x equal to 0 in the

7
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:44,505
equation. When we put x equals 0 in this equation, we get. 2 times 0 minus y

8
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:53,493
equals 6. 2 times 0 is 0. So we have negative y equals 6. And, we can divide

9
00:00:53,493 --> 00:01:01,913
both sides by negative 1, which gives us y equals negative 6. So, the

10
00:01:01,913 --> 00:01:08,450
y-intercept is 0. -6. If you got the answer right, great work. If you didn't get

11
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,458
it right, don't worry, just go back and look at the video, and try again.
