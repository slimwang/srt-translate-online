Here's a simple ACME description for a client server system.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,230
At the outermost level is the keyword system indicating that what's being

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,390
provided here is a configuration describing this particular architecture.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:20,230
The system has a name, in this case simple CS, and then contained within it,

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:26,700
are some other statements describing the constituents of that particular system.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,060
In this case, there are two components. One is called client and

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,760
one is called server, and there's one connector. Also there are two

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,880
attachments for plugging them together. The first component client has one port

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,080
out of which requests are sent. The second component server has one port for

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,080
receiving a request. The connector, which is called RPC, has two roles.

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,690
One of which is called the caller role and one of which is called the callee

12
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,540
role. Then, in a natural fashion to attach these together,

13
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:06,960
the client's send request port is connected to the connectors caller role.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,892
And similarly the servers receive request port is connected to the connectors

15
00:01:12,892 --> 00:01:18,130
callee role, hence we now plug together.

16
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,600
The client, the server, using the connector in such a way that the ports and

17
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,540
roles are plugged into each other. The system is thus configured in such a way

18
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,750
that the client can send requests using its port through the connectors so

19
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,620
the server receives those requests and can then act upon them.
