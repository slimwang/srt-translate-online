1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,650
So could you give me an example
of bad measurements?

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:04,160
>> Yeah.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,860
I mean, again and again,
you see people look at the wrong thing,

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,750
and I think the most common thing
is when people look at users and

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,830
they don't measure the number
of users properly.

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,410
Now, that's true in a company that
should be generating a revenue

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,120
as looking at the number of users,

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,400
rather than how much revenue
those users are generating.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,480
That happens a lot.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,570
But, it's also true even with companies
that should just be looking at users,

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,420
when they count users wrong.

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,340
They'll say,
we had 50,000 sign ups in the last week.

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,620
Okay, a sign up is not a user.

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,170
How frequently are those users
engaging with your product?

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,050
>> So looking at patterns of retention.

16
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,000
>> Exactly.
I mean,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,320
retention's everything when
you're looking at users.

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,940
If you have people that sign up on
day 1 and they never come back,

19
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,590
it looks terrible, and
it means you're building a bad product.

20
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,370
Something, again that's a mile-wide,
inch-deep kind of thing,

21
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,960
because no one really needs it.

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,460
If you have something where
you only have 1,000 users, but

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,740
they use it ten times a day,
now you're on to something.

24
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,160
It might not feel as good as having
50,000 sign-ups, but it's so

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,610
much better because it's
the base that you can grow from.
