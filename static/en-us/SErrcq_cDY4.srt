1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,660
One possible explanation is simply that the

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,880
router is misconfigured. In other words, no one

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,780
actually intended for the router to advertise a

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,950
false route, but because of a misconfiguration the

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,390
router does so. The AS seven zero zero

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,200
seven attack that we discussed last time Was

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,160
actually the result of a configuration error. Second,

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,570
a router might be compromised by an attacker.

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,040
Once a router is compromised, the attacker can

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,409
reconfigure the router to, for example, advertise false

11
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,640
routes. Finally, unscrupulous ISPs might also decide to

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,900
advertise routes that they should not be advertising.

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,610
To launch the attack An attacker might reconfigure

14
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,920
the router, which is typically the most common

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,100
way an attacker might launch an attack. The

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,290
attacker might also tamper with software, or an attacker

17
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,540
could actively modify a routing message. In addition to tampering

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,170
with the configuration, the attacker might tamper with the management

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,270
software that changes the configuration. And the most common attack

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,760
is a route highjack attack or an attack on origin authentication.
