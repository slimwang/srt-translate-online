1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer is one1 as we expected.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now that happens to be a trivial example of a two reasons.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
One is b=1 is the most simple case of the linear relationship, but secondly, there is no noise.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This equation of b = 1 will fit to data exactly, but we did it

5
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to exercise the use of the formula.
