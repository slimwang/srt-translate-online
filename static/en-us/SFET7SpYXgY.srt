For 50 years, the identity of HM was hidden. However, after his passing, and

2
00:00:05,951 --> 00:00:11,723
agreed by his family, his name was revealed, and he was Henry Molaison. Now

3
00:00:11,723 --> 00:00:15,749
Henry started experiencing epileptic seizures when he was a child, and in fact

4
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:21,904
these grew in both duration and frequency. In fact they were debilitating. He

5
00:00:21,904 --> 00:00:25,232
could lose consciousness and have a seizure weekly, and sometime have minor

6
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:30,230
attacks up to ten times a day. Now as you can imagine, these seizures greatly

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,900
interfered with his daily living. So much so that he wasn't able to get his

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,690
high school diploma until age 21. By then, unfortunately, the seizures were so

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,760
bad it was difficult for him to even hold down a job.
