1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,180
I think in order to learn the language,

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,650
it's important to know a little
bit about the cultural background.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,220
In order to learn that, I think you
need to seek out the people who

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,220
are interested in sharing it with you.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:21,090
And I think that's probably
the most important part is to be

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,630
culturally aware and respectful of what
people are willing to share with you.

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:33,070
So for example, I was not culturally

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,950
sensitive when I was thinking
about my thesis topic.

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,110
I wanted to bridge the gap between my
undergrad thesis on native language and

10
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,950
its effect on my identity and tech since
I'm currently in Computer Science.

11
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:54,247
I wanted to bridge that gap and where
I was I wouldn't say disrespectful,

12
00:00:54,247 --> 00:00:56,991
just not going about it the right way.

13
00:00:56,991 --> 00:01:00,060
Usually you're invited by somebody.

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,410
You're invited to somebody's home and
it's about just being in

15
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:10,480
that space with that person and whatever
they're comfortable sharing with you.

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,800
Like an elder, the person who I was
wanting to speak with was an elder.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,060
And I spoke with his son and
he's like, you can't go in there and

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,010
just ask questions and
expect them to be answered.

19
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,820
And that's exactly what
I was intending to do.

20
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,720
And after talking to him
a little bit more I understood.

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,230
And all the knowledge that
I wanted to gain from that

22
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,790
conversation was not going about
it in a culturally sensitive way.

23
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,202
And that's me, within the tribe,
another tribal person,

24
00:01:44,202 --> 00:01:47,824
there are, I want to say, regulations.

25
00:01:47,824 --> 00:01:49,750
What can you do, and what can't you do?

26
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,850
And what I was doing
was not appropriate.
