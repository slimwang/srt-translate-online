00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,830
Did you have fun?

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,860
Has your mind been blown?

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,995
You just went from analyzing syntactic
sugar to being able to define whatever

4
00:00:07,995 --> 00:00:10,170
methods you want, whenever you want.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,920
And you can now write
code that writes code.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,610
>> Totally.

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,600
This lesson focused on practical
applications that you'll be able to use

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,100
right away to create methods on the fly
and keep your code dry in the process.

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,490
Remember, there's no magic,
it's just Ruby.

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,390
There's still a ton of information
available on the web that go deeper into

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,650
the theoretical foundations
of metaprogramming.

12
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,600
We've included a reading list below
that you can check out if you want

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,240
