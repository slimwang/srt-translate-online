00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] Here's our first programming 
exercise.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'd like you to make a robot that starts 
at coordinates 30 and 50,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and it heads north, which means its 
heading direction is pi/2.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It then turns clockwise by pi/2, which 
means you subtract pi/2 from the

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
heading direction, and it moves 15 meters.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It then senses, and I want you to print 
out the sensor measurements.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It then turns clockwise by pi/2 again, 
and moves 10 meters this time

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,869
and I just want you to print out the
sensor measurements after this entire

9
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:39,270
procedure. So, there are 2 print
statements for the sensor over here

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,192
and the sensor measurements over here. So,
here's the output I would like your

11
00:00:43,192 --> 00:00:45,000
program to generate.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
After the first motion, the first
measurements will be 39 plus something,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,090
46, 39, and 46.

14
00:00:53,123 --> 00:00:58,622
And then after the second motion I expect
to see 32, 53, 47, 40.

15
00:00:58,622 --> 00:01:01,522
Of course, there's lots of decimal-point
numbers over here,

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,650
but these are the numbers I would expect
you to output.

17
00:01:04,675 --> 00:01:07,432
So, have fun coding it!
