00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,555
To get to the vertex form for the equation for this problem, we need to go

2
00:00:04,555 --> 00:00:09,637
through the process of completing the square, just like you've done many, many

3
00:00:09,637 --> 00:00:14,644
times before. The equation in vertex form is y plus 3 equals negative 7 times x

4
00:00:14,644 --> 00:00:18,997
minus 1 squared, which means that the vertex is at 1 comma negative 3.
