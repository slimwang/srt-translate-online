00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,952
In addition to studying false memory, psychologists also study forgetting and

2
00:00:03,952 --> 00:00:09,249
memory loss. Now, forgetting and memory loss are suggestive and reconstructive

3
00:00:09,249 --> 00:00:15,128
processes. Sometimes it's easy to think of our memory as an objective recorder.

4
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:18,898
When, in fact, we see that our memories are affected by how we distort, select,

5
00:00:18,898 --> 00:00:24,390
or even bias memory of events. So forgetting is the weakening of memories over

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,615
time and I'm going to share a personal example of that with you next. When we

7
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:32,455
think about forgetting, we think about things we may have learned in school,

8
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:37,499
such as definitions, equations or formulas. But we can also forget personal

9
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:43,869
episodic memories. For example, my Dad died when I was only 14 years old. And

10
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:47,314
for sometime after that I had lots of memories of everyday activities, things

11
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:52,244
such as eating dinner, going for ice cream or even watching TV. However, one

12
00:00:52,244 --> 00:00:56,148
day when I was about 16 years old I realized that I had forgotten what my dad

13
00:00:56,148 --> 00:01:01,790
sounded like. Now in those days we didn't have video cameras or phones with

14
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,716
cameras on them so I had no film of my dad talking. When I remember this, I was

15
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:12,686
so angry and upset with myself. I was beside myself. I thought how could you

16
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:15,770
forget what your own father sounds like? What kind of a daughter am I if I

17
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,640
can't even remember what my dad sounded like? Now I have since learned not to

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,402
be so hard on myself for forgetting those things, because I hadn't been exposed

19
00:01:23,402 --> 00:01:29,188
to it in such a long time. However, I do try to actively recall and remember

20
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:34,347
more memories so I don't lose those. Now as an example of just how subjective

21
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:37,900
memory can be. My brother and a friend of ours recently got together, who we

22
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,784
hadn't seen in 20 years. And we were talking about this time that we all went

23
00:01:41,784 --> 00:01:46,389
down to this stream and we caught a carp. We brought it back to my mom. Each of

24
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:52,310
us had a different memory of what our mom said and did when she saw that fish.

25
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,337
So we can see just how individual and subjective our memories can be. Perhaps

26
00:01:57,337 --> 00:01:59,756
you can talk to your parents or siblings, and see if you can come up with a

27
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:03,580
memory, and whether or not you all agree on that's what really happened.
