00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,230
We're here with Harpinder Singh,
a partner at Innovation Endeavors, and

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,050
the CEO of Slice.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,140
Thank you for joining us.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,900
>> Thank you, Amir,
it's a pleasure to be here.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,510
>> So
how did you become an entrepreneur?

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,650
>> So, my journey's a little bit
different from most other entrepreneurs.

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,510
I met my co-founders at
Stanford Business School back in 2000,

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,270
and we were working together on
a business plan before we graduated and

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,860
that idea did not pan out.

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,340
But we really enjoyed working
together as a team, so

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,330
we were essentially
a team before an idea.

12
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,820
And we all decided to commit six months,
we decided to say no to the jobs.

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,680
And we invested some of our own money,
and

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,320
went through a structured search
process for about six months.

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,940
We looked at a few different spaces,
several different ideas, and

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,770
our benchmark was can we get
excited about something ourselves?

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,415
And do we want to spend the next six or
seven years doing it?

18
00:00:55,415 --> 00:00:57,830
So that's what we did,
we created a company called FiberTower.

19
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,160
It was a wireless infrastructure
company which we built and

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,410
sold after six or seven years.

21
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,880
And, we took some time off, and
the same thing came together.

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,330
And, we did the same exact process,
looked at a few different spaces,

23
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,460
few different ideas, and
created Slice out of it.

24
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,540
And the common theme was we,
at that time,

25
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,290
felt that wireless was growing a lot and
e-commerce receipts were growing, and

26
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,410
we felt that data would
be very valuable.

27
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,790
So, that's what we've
done two times now.

28
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,440
>> So how do I determine that my idea

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,350
is the right idea to
build a business around?

30
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,549
>> As an investor and as a founder,
the answer may be somewhat different.

31
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,300
As an investor,
I'm definitely trying to see is this

32
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,700
potentially a big market,
a high growth market?

33
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,550
Does it give you enough room for
exploration and for errors?

34
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,180
So, that's one thing that's important.

35
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,390
And then the second is do you have
some defensibility, at least for

36
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,620
a few years until you create room for
yourself.

37
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,520
And as a founder, there's a couple of
other factors that become important.

38
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,750
I mean, as a founder it's not
always clear from the beginning,

39
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,930
is it a big market,
is this like a mega-market, and so on?

40
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,990
So you generally want pick big markets,
but

41
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,990
you're picking problems that
you can relate to personally.

42
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,626
And, I like to pick problems that
have some kind of defensibility

43
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:33,140
around technology, or
around the data component.

44
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,439
So, you want to create
some barrier that the guy

45
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:43,490
across the street just
can't do over night.

46
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,540
>> So should an entrepreneur find a
small niche or think big from the start?

47
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,880
>> It depends on how you define niche.

48
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,370
Snapchat is niche, Instagram is niche,
but these are big companies.

49
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,170
I think there's couple of
different ways to think about it.

50
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,684
I have friends who have
acquired small companies,

51
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:07,370
$10 million revenue companies, and
grown them to $30, $50 million revenues,

52
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,060
and grown the EBITDAs, and they've
created a lot of shareholder value.

53
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,240
I think the traditional Silicon Valley
would look at that and say,

54
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,860
that's not big.

55
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,200
So if you're thinking technology,
if you're thinking Silicon Valley,

56
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,420
especially if you're thinking
about raising venture capital,

57
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,000
then I think the bar is different.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,870
People are looking for
billion dollar plus outcomes.

59
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,350
And there, by definition,
you're looking for

60
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,760
big markets, ability to accumulate
large user bases and so on.

61
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,980
So it really depends on
what your strengths are.

62
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,240
Are you more of an operator
that wants to optimize?

63
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,370
Are you more of an innovator that
wants to sort of create magic and

64
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,810
have this thing that can just sort of
grow to be something unimaginable?

65
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,020
And there are trade-offs.

66
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,970
It depends on how much
capital do you want to raise.

67
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,710
It depends on what kind of employees
will you attract, how much ownership

68
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,840
will you retain, and, really, what is
the core competence of the business?

69
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,775
Is it design and product,
is it operations, is it sales?

70
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:17,529
So I think there is no
one answer to this.

71
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,220
People have created a lot
of shareholder value

72
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,764
from what might seem small
versus what seem like megahits.
