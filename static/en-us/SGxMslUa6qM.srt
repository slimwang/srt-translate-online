1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,490
So let's look at these two representations again a little carefully.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,440
Now, typically to do any kinds of processing we would actually require us to

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,030
be able to create a discrete representation of a matrix like this.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,440
So something like this can be converted into a matrix, as I've shown before.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,320
Of course I'm just showing you a six by six part of this.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,660
But basically this entire thing would be represented as a matrix.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,870
And what we would be doing is,

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,630
basically we're trying to sample the two dimensional space into a regular grid.

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,030
In this, the regular grid are basically columns and rows.

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,500
And that allows us to be able to now look for

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,580
values that we can actually start looking at as we traverse through.

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,870
So I can start counting down in raster scan format,

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,530
going down the axes this way, and wrapping around.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,960
And basically, in essence, what it means is now we have a matrix,

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,030
just like I showed before, of integer values ranging from 0 to 255.

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,600
Now my goal is to give you a bit of an intuition of what this image looks like.

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,800
And what are the kinds of things within it.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,910
Again, let's take of this black and white or grayscale image.

19
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,730
And I'm going to now both again zoom into right box here, but

20
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,800
also kind of show you this image in few different ways.

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,100
So the first video I'm going to show here is basically the height map

22
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,770
of this image.

23
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,340
If you look at it as it's being rotated around,

24
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,610
you can actually see the pixel values that I was referring to earlier.

25
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,410
And these peaks and

26
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,540
valleys kind of show again that the intensity values of the image

27
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,680
have various types of statistics associated with it, and by playing around with

28
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,650
those statistics we can actually do a lot of interesting things to images.

29
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,640
Now I'm going to show the same thing, for this sub-image, again zooming in.

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,574
Now here again you notice the, gray and

31
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,660
the white regions which we have seen before.

32
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,810
And now in this video which you see basically,

33
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:58,550
as I rotate around that basically see some of the details.

34
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:04,040
And also the, the ridge, that shows up between the, the hill and

35
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,190
as we go towards the value which is again the lower values of gray here.
