00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Grid networks are also very important.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
They represent the connectivity pattern you have

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
if you lay out a bunch of things as a grid

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and connect them up, each one to their neighbor

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
sort of street-wise if this was a grid-based city.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Here's a particular example of a grid network

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
with 20 nodes--1, 2, 3, 4 times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and 31 edges if I counted correctly.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In particular, there are three edges to go across,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 rows like that,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
so that's 15, and there's 4 edges going down,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and there are 1, 2, 3, 4 rows like that

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
for 16 for a total of 31.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So just to make sure that you understand how to do this,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
imagine we have 256 nodes arranged in a square,

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and we connect up the nodes with edges in a grid pattern

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
just like this one here.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
How many total edges do we have in the graph?
