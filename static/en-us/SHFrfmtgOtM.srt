00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,870
This one is pretty simple.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:05,800
All you have to do is add the
placeholder attribute to the input and

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,430
set it to some text,
which in this case is Event Name.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,620
And this is how it looks.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,720
Notice that you can see Event Name
within the input when there's no text.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,670
But when you start typing,
it disappears.

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,350
Nice.

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,450
All right, let's keep going.
