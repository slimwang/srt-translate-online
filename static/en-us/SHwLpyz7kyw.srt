1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,790
So, those are examples of precondition.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,980
There's another one.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,840
Think for a second and

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,830
see if you can come up with one
other potential precondition.

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,560
>> So, for the last requirement, you
could be in a situation where someone

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,230
continually is trying to check out the
same vulnerable item over and over again

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,660
and one of our requirements states
that you can renew an item once once.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,210
But, if there is another
outstanding request for

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,530
that item, then you shouldn't be allowed
to check it out because other people may

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,390
be wanting to check out the same thing.

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,090
>> We're talking about
checking out an item.

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:39,030
And if you've all ready got it checked
out and you want to keep it longer,

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,815
that's a renewal, not a check out.

14
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:45,150
>> But clearly, we're going to

15
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,030
have to deal with that situation
when we get to considering renewals.

16
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,900
>> So, the other possibility is
you'd like to check this out, but

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,350
it turns out that it's
the hottest bestseller,

18
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,520
and there's 44 people before
you in the list of requests.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,388
>> So
even though you happened to find it,

20
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:07,370
because it was just put back,
it was put back by mistake and

21
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,810
they're not going to let check it out
because somebody else has requested it.

22
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,350
>> So, the request queue needs to be
empty so to speak for you to be able to.

23
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,720
>> Well, almost.

24
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,570
How about if you're
the person that requested it?

25
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,460
>> If you're the first
person that requested,

26
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,010
then the precondition should hold and-
>> Right.

27
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:24,800
>> Execute.

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,410
>> It's not am empty queue.

29
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,400
It could be a queue with one
thing in it or a queue actually

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,290
with any number of things in it as
long as you're top on the list.

31
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,100
>> Okay.

32
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:34,600
>> Okay.
