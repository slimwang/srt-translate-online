00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,120
Which leads to the following question.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,150
We all know class model diagrams distinguish associations in which the leading

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,240
collection deletes its elements from those that don't. The question for

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,340
you is, what is the visual indication of the former,

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,610
that is, the situation in which deleting a collection deletes its elements?

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,340
And I give you four choices. A triangle on the end of an association line,

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,440
an asterisk on the end of an association line, a filled diamond on

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,100
the collection end of the line, and a delete operation in the class itself.
