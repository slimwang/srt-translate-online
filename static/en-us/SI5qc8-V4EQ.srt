00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,708
Looking at the compound inequality we have, which we can also write in interval

2
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:07,532
notation, of course. Seems like, considering we have the same number, almost,

3
00:00:07,532 --> 00:00:11,297
written twice, just one of it with a negative sign. There should be some sort of

4
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:14,989
simpler way to write this. It's not exactly redundant right now, but it seems a

5
00:00:14,989 --> 00:00:19,292
little bit redundant. What we really know is that we want the difference between

6
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:23,127
0 so we want the distance it takes from on a number line to get from 0 out to

7
00:00:23,127 --> 00:00:27,352
either end of the tolerance is just .3, either in the positive direction or the

8
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:31,295
negative direction. One way we can denote this is by using what's called

9
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:35,311
absolute value signs. We can think of the absolute value of a number as the

10
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:39,672
distance between that number and 0. This distance is absolute in that it ignores

11
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:44,347
direction. We can see that counting from positive point 3 back to zero takes us

12
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:48,761
point 1, point 2, point 3. But the same is true of negative point 3. Point 1,

13
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:52,848
point 2, point 3. So positive point 3 and negative point 3 have the same

14
00:00:52,848 --> 00:00:57,643
absolute value, because they're the same distance from zero on the number line.

15
00:00:57,643 --> 00:01:01,636
Now that you have an idea of what absolute value is, can you tell me what the

16
00:01:01,636 --> 00:01:05,901
absolute value of negative 9 is? And what the absolute value of 4 and a half is?

17
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:09,683
The number line is here just for you to have a visual in case you feel like

18
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:11,002
counting on something.
