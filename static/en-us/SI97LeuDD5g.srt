1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, let's go try it out together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
When we're in chart state 0, when we haven't seen any of the input yet,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we started in position 0. there is no hidden input we're missing.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There is no processing that we've already done.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Even as we move initially into this first state in chart position 1,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
we've seen one token, and look, there's one token to the left of this dot.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We got here by reading in the input, left parenthesis, from chart position 0.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh, we were expecting a left parenthesis. Great. I just move my finger over to the right.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Essentially, I copy this previous rule, P goes to dot open P close starting at 0,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and I bring it down here into chart 1.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But now I have the dot, I have my finger, before P.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If I'm expecting to see a P in the future, I could see another open parentheses,

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
because that's one of the things that P can rewrite to.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I could also see nothing, because that's another thing that P could be rewritten to.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I've included both of those--they're right here--one, two--

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
based on this rule and this P--one, two.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Brought those two in.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I brought them in based on thinking hard about chart one,

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and they assume that I've already seen this left parenthesis.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
These two rules start at position 1.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Since one of the things I'm considering is that P is totally empty,

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
up here I was thinking, oh, I could've seen a left parenthesis

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and been expecting a P and then a right parenthesis, but if P disappears

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
then I'm already past it, and I'm expecting a right parenthesis.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I got this from this rule up here, which came from chart position 0.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now, we just so happen to know what the actual next piece of input was.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We saw an open parenthesis and then another open parenthesis.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It must've been that we were looking at this very special rule right here.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We saw the open parenthesis and this one was right, and all of the others were wrong.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They were possibilities, but they didn't pan out.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We took this rule here and move our finger over, shift it past this open parenthesis,

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
so we get open parenthesis dot P close. That's right where we started here.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It is bringing over this rule that had previously said starting at 1 it still says starting at 1,

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
but now I do the trick and this is the part where the numbers change.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
If my dot is right in front of a P, then I could be expecting to see a left parenthesis,

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
we're not going to in the input, but you never know, or nothing.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Once again, based on this P, I'm going to start bringing in rules 1 and 2.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
P goes to dot open P close. P goes to nothing.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But this time we started in position 2.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This was a very tricky quiz. You should not feel bad if elements of this gave you grief.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We're going to go over this in much more detail later on.
