00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In the final question, I'd like to explore something.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I don't have a good answer for this, but I'd like you to play with those parameters over here--

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
the data weight, the weight smoother, the control parameters p_gain and d_gain.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Play with them, try to find a setting that gives me fewer collisions on average

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
than my current parameters and maybe reaches the goal even faster.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I should warn you these are about the best variables I could find,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but I didn't really apply twiddle to this.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I did more of an approximate investigation of what a good parameter might be.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
When you apply twiddle and try this, you will find that it's hard to apply

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
because your function might never return, so you have to build in the time somehow.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's fun playing with those to see if you can find a better solution than what I gave you.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If you do so, don't expect the correct answer from me. I didn't implement it myself.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But I want to give you the opportunity to play with those parameters

14
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and see what the effects are on this solution.
