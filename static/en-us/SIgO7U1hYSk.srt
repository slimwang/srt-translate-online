00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,540
The correct answer or at least the answer I'm looking

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,190
for is query the database. This step querying the database, that

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,850
means we're leaving our program and making a request to this

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,870
other system, which in the leading nature of my description is

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,380
obviously not as fast as these other things. And in

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,480
the real world the databases almost always the slowest piece. Sometimes

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,870
you don't have a database. But when you do, it's almost

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,450
always the slowest piece. And improving the speed of your database

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,330
is something that's pretty important.
