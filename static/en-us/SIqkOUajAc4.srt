1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,070
That ends the lesson on PCA.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,660
It's a very general method.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,670
People use principle
components all the time.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,670
And the face recognition method is
just what we use to introduce it.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,780
Although I will say, it's become very
well known because, not just because how

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,760
well it worked and caught,
sort of caught people by surprise, but

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,860
just it had this very
clean interpretation.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,220
In fact, now people, you'll hear,

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,300
instead of eiganfaces,
you'll hear about eigangaits.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,070
Right?
So you,

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,080
you take measurements of people walking,

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,159
you try to find a principle component
analysis, project them down and do it.

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,260
There are eigan body shapes,
which is terrifying to think about, but

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,260
basically the idea of, I've, you know,
people vary in different shapes, and

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,560
I should be able to take a small
number of variations and

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,410
say I can fit you by just
a small number of control knobs.

17
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,625
If you're doing computer graphics
animation, and you want to be able to

18
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:51,843
control the different shapes of
people to build different characters,

19
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,320
you want to be able to just turn
a small number of knobs and

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,170
have people change their overall build,
their height, and things like that.

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,150
And you can use this,
principal component analysis, or

22
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,550
more sophisticated versions of it,
to do that.

23
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,850
The method that I've shown you
here also is a linear method.

24
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,820
Right?
All these things are orthogonal.

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,530
And I could compute the coefficients
by just taking the dot products.

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,500
And that's a nice property to have,
it makes things easy to do, but

27
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,496
it's also a liability.

28
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,606
If I have a, just say,
a three-dimensional space,

29
00:01:22,606 --> 00:01:26,610
suppose I have points that actually
just lie along a curve, okay?

30
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,430
So they are all on a single curve,

31
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,540
which means if you just told
me the value along that curve,

32
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,750
that would represent the point
completely, assuming I knew the curve.

33
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,690
But it's not a line, it's a curve,
okay, so it, it bends.

34
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,480
So there are non-linear methods of doing
principal component analysis that allow

35
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,850
you to capture, sort of non-linear,
lower-dimensional manifolds.

36
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,004
We won't talk about it here, but,

37
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:56,570
in fact there's one's called
non-linear kernel PCA.

38
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,700
But for now, all you need to know
about is what we talked about here,

39
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,950
linear orthogonal decomposition
of principle components.
