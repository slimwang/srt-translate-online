00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,469
Let's take a deeper look at Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, and that's the need to

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:08,729
belong. Humans have a need for social contact and belonging, and this is both

3
00:00:08,729 --> 00:00:13,816
powerful and universal. Indeed, as we've said throughout the course, humans are

4
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:18,409
social creatures and we need interaction. Perhaps remember the lesson on

5
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:23,625
development with Terry Harlow and his research with the baby monkeys. Those

6
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:27,017
monkeys needed contact comfort, and they chose among them the most resemble

7
00:00:27,017 --> 00:00:27,842
their own over the

00:00:27,842 --> 00:00:28,289
[UNKNOWN]

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,592
mother, even though she had the food. Now, we too as humans have a need for

10
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:37,362
others in order to thrive, and this need for social contact and belongingness

11
00:00:37,362 --> 00:00:40,780
is called the need for affiliation.
