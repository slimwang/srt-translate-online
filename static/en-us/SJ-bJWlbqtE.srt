1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So now let's look what happens when Alice spends a bill

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
to see how to solve the double spending problem.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
At the end of this protocol, Alice will have a message like this,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
where each one of these identity pairs is one of those pairs of hashes.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
To spend the bill, Alice sends the bill to Cathy,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and Cathy sends a challenge back to Alice.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And what the challenge is, is a list of M random bits.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
These will tell Alice which parts of the identity she needs to open.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So in order for Cathy to accept the bill,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
what Alice has to do now is, for each one of these, validate one part of the hash.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So if Cathy's challenge bit was 0,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
what Alice has to provide is the 0 part of Identity 1--

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and remember what Identity 1 is

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
is the hash of the 0 part of Identity 1

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
concatenated with the hash of the 1 part where the property we need

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
is that these 2 values XOR to Alice.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If the challenge is 1, then it'll send the 1 part of the corresponding identity, and so on.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So now Cathy can validate these hashes.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So she's going to check that this matches the values sent by Alice.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And we'll do that for all the identities.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If they all match, Cathy accepts the bill.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
When she deposits it, she sends these I values to the bank.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So suppose Alice tries to spend the bill again.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This time she'll send it to Doug.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Doug will do the same protocol.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He'll make a challenge, send that challenge to Alice,

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
get back the I values, but they'll be the ones corresponding to his challenge.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And he'll do the same check before accepting the bill.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And now Doug can deposit the bill, sending along the same I values.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So now what does the bank have?

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It has both parts of one of the I values.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
As long as one of these challenge bits is different,

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the bank knows there was double spending

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
because it saw R-K value twice.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It also knows the identity of the person who obtained that bill

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
because it can XOR the 0 part of Identity 1,

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
which it received from Cathy when she deposited the bill,

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
with the 1 part of the identity, which the bank received from Doug

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
when he deposited the bill.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So now the bank can tell the police to arrest Alice for double spending a bill.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So to see that you understand all of this,

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
the question is, "If Alice spends a bill twice,

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
"and M the number of identities included in the bill is 10,

44
00:02:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
"what is the probability that she gets caught?"
