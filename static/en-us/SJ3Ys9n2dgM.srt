1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,500
I was lucky this time that there was nobody in

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,570
the queue when I, when I first came and requested

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,320
the lock. But another time, I may not be that

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,180
lucky. There may be somebody else using the lock already, and

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,370
if that is the case, then what I would have

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,430
to do is to queue myself in this data structure.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,180
And the way to do that, is to indicate by

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,360
setting the last pointer, in this list to point to me.

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,810
This pointer is always pointing to the last requestor. In this

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,600
case, the original case that I showed you, I was the

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,090
only requestor that was also last requestor. But now, the queue

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,130
has somebody using that particular lock, and so when I come in,

13
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,010
what I'm going to do is, I'm going to set this field of

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,140
the lock data structure, the dummy load, the head node, of the

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,906
lock data structure to point to me and the last requester.

16
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:51,830
And I'm also going to fix up the link list so that the

17
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,200
current guy is going to point to me. Why am i doing

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,350
this? Well, the reason i do this is because when he is

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,990
done using the lock, he needs to reach out and signal me.

20
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,420
What am I going to be doing? I'm going to be spinning. And what

21
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,230
am I spinning on? I'm spinning on the got-it flag. So this

22
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,140
is a data structure that is associated with me, and one of

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,250
the fields, you know, is the got-it field in the data structure.

24
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,610
So I'm going to spin on this got-it field in the data structure,

25
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,500
waiting for this guy to set it to two. So,

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,620
I initialized it to false when I came in, and form

27
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,690
this request. When I form this request, what I did was

28
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,990
to set myself as the last requester, I'll clear out this

29
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,800
field to indicate that I don't have the lock, and I'll

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,630
set up the link list so that the current lock holder

31
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,970
points to me through his next field. And my next field

32
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,380
of course, is null because there is no requester after me.

33
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,230
So once I fixed up this, link list and in this fashion,

34
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,350
then I basically can spend on my got it a boolean variable.
