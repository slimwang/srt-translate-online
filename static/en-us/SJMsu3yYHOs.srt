00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So at first we draw values from a normal distribution with µ and σ² parameters

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and say it equals a value A, then what's the mean and the variance of aA+b

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
where a and b are constants.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'll give you possible answers down here from 1 to 7 and you have to plug an expression

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
to either one of those by giving me the corresponding number.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So if you think the expressions over here would be for example σ²+b², you type in 3 over here.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If you think it's over here aσ², you type in 7, so either one of those, you have a number

8
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in mind 7 and as a hint, once an expression is used up, you can use it again.
