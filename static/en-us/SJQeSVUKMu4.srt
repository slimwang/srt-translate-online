00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,170
For this quadratic, we want to find factors of 1 times negative 4 that sum to 3.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:10,560
Negative 1 and 4, multiply, to give us negative 4 and sum to give us 3. Since

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,342
the coefficient on the square term is just 1, I can use these factors for my

4
00:00:14,342 --> 00:00:18,930
factored form. Remember that this would not be the case if this was not a 1.

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,737
We'd have to use factoring by grouping. Then, we use our 0 product property to

6
00:00:23,737 --> 00:00:28,060
set each factor equal to 0. Adding one to both sides, we get p is equal to 1.

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,590
And subtracting four from both sides, we could get p is equal to negative 4.

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,673
Great work if you got this solution set.
