1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,570
And by the way, I happen to be
estimating position, velocity.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,130
I could also estimate acceleration.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,950
Right?
So, here my state position, my,

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,540
my state vector is position,
velocity and acceleration.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,990
All right.
And I'm just including that to show you

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,670
that that's a choice that
you make as the model maker.

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,730
You're going to build a model for
doing this tracking, and this, and

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,640
this is what we're going to do.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,870
And, again, I can write this out as
a linear system, using matrix notation.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,890
But now we have, instead of a two by
two matrix, We have the 3 by 3 matrix,

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,690
which includes the components
having to do with acceleration.

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,370
By the way, the other choice,
you also have when you do this, and

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,230
I just mention this for

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,520
completeness, is you can assume
that there's noise in here or not.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,510
You can make those be 0 and just have
the noise be in the acceleration.

16
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,190
It's not that you're assuming
your model is perfect.

17
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,560
That is,
that your estimates are perfect.

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,950
You're just saying, well I'm actually
going to believe that the velocity

19
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,650
that this is how
the position's really moving,

20
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,510
and this is how the velocity's
really changing.

21
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,910
And the only place that I'm putting
in any change is in the acceleration,

22
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,650
and you can, you can do that either way.

23
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,380
If you didn't understand what
that meant, don't worry about it.

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,180
Our measurement can still be the same.

25
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,710
It can just be position only.

26
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,570
And you might ask well,
if it's just position,

27
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,970
how do you ever get velocity and
acceleration?

28
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,630
These equations that we'll set up, will,
whether you sort of do the invert to

29
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,170
solve for things, it figures out that
you have to take the differences between

30
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,700
the positions,
divided by delta time velocity and

31
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,340
the difference between velocity is
divided by delta time for acceleration.

32
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,960
Even if we're only measuring position.
