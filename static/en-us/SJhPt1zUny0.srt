1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,670
To make sure we understand this cost
function, I want you to suppose that

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,780
the function alpha is 0 if
the two characters are the same.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,740
And that it's 1 otherwise.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,280
And to calculate the cost
of this alignment here.
