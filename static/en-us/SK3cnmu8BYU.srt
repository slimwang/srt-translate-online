1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is right over here. Why?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If a cars starting point is the point over here, for which we know the location is 1,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and the velocity is 1, and if we predict 1 time step in the future,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
then for that prediction, we know the location will be 2,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and the velocity might be a little uncertain, but it stays about the same.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So we end up with a point over here. Let's do this again.
