00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,330
We've covered a lot of ground in the last few units. You've learned how to

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,200
declare variables, and I want to come back to the question, what do you do with

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,150
a variable once you've declared it. Here we have a variable, planet. It's of

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,080
type picture, and it's somehow initialized. Now I want to use the variable. I

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,150
want to call a method on it. What methods can I call? And when I pick a method,

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,110
what values should I give it? That's what the Public Interface of the Class

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:29,280
tells us. It tells me, which methods I can use and what values I should supply.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,060
Let me give you an analogy. The public interface of a car is all of the buttons

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,460
and gizmos that you see here on the dashboard. A while ago, I was driving along

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,890
in this rental car I could not figure out how to turn on the dome light, so I

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,308
had to pull out the owners manual. The public interface of the class is also

12
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:53,620
described in a kind of owners manual, called javadoc. That's the owners manual

13
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,890
of a class or of a set of classes, let's have a look at javadoc.
