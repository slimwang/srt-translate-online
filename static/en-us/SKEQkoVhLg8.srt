00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,310
So now let me take a moment to tell you a little bit about the class.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,700
This class is about computational photography,

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,820
which is actually nowadays also considered a discipline.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,200
This discipline is about building the computational technology, and

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,130
the tools to basically figure out

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,540
how light from the environment is used to generate images and photographs.

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:24,470
We will be concentrating on the computational aspect of this pipeline,

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,950
how computation impacts photography.

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,390
It's an interesting discipline because if you really hard think about it,

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,840
the computation is impacting an artistic and

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,980
aesthetic aspect of what photography is.

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,210
But again, I emphasize,

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,280
we'll be spending time on trying to understand the technology that impacts this

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,760
whole pipeline of how light is used to generate images and photographs.
