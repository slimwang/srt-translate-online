Thanks, Lauren. Let's move on to behavioral observation. What do we mean by

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,682
this? Remember that personality involves consistent and unique styles of

3
00:00:09,682 --> 00:00:15,182
behaving, thinking, feeling, and our motivations. Now, it is the case that

4
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:20,942
other people cannot directly observe our thoughts. Internal feelings or

5
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:27,360
motivations. However, they can directly observe behavior. So having observers

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,020
make ratings of personality, based on behavior, is one technique used by

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,303
psychologist, to rate personality. This technique is popular when ratings of

8
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:40,335
personality, need to made be of people who can not easily describe their own

9
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:46,082
personality, such as young children. But it's not so simple as having a person

10
00:00:46,082 --> 00:00:50,850
sit down and rate the personality of another. Why is that?
