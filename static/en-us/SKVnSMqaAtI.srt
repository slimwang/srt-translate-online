00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,969
One way to solve this problem, is to look at the possibilities.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:12,580
We know that there is a bigger number, the median, and a smaller number.

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,780
And that we have 3 inputs--

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,820
Let's call them "a," "b," and "c."

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,720
Let's say, for the sake of example--

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,630
that we figure out that "b" is the bigger number.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,460
We could solve this using the bigger function that you defined in lecture.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,500
From here, we only need to figure out what is the median and the smaller number.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,840
We know "b" can't be the median,

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,910
because we just decided that it was the bigger number.

11
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,640
From here, all we have to do is compare "a" and "c."

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,210
There are two cases at this point.

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,010
One is where "a" is greater than "c."

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,420
If "a" is greater than "c," we know "c" is the smaller number--

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,490
and "a" is the median.

16
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:57,390
If "c" is greater than "a," we know that "a" is the smaller number--

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,190
and "c" is the median.

18
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,800
We can use this strategy to solve every possible case when defining our function.

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,900
So let's take a crack at it by going right to the interpreter.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,670
So, first let's define our function.

21
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,370
As specified in the problem, it's called median--and we take in 3 parameters.

22
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,440
As I did before, we are going to call them "a," "b," and "c."

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,720
As I described earlier, we want to find the biggest number first, let's call it "big."

24
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,090
Here's the perfect time to use the function that we defined in class, "biggest."

25
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,890
"Biggest" will give us the biggest number, as the name describes--

26
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,630
by simply passing in those 3 parameters.

27
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,930
From here, we enumerate the possible cases.

28
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,100
As I described earlier, if "a" is the biggest number,

29
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,000
you want to return the bigger number of "b" and "c."

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,570
If "b" is the biggest number, we want to return the bigger number of "a" and "c."

31
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,840
And lastly, if "c" is the biggest number,

32
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,540
which is satisfied by the else here,

33
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,540
we want to return the bigger number of "a" and "b."
