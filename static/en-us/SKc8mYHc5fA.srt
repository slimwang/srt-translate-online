00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,860
Here are the factor pairs for negative 20. In the first three factor pairs I

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,518
made the first number negative and the second three factor pairs I made the

3
00:00:07,518 --> 00:00:11,272
second number negative. The only factor pair that adds to negative one is four

4
00:00:11,272 --> 00:00:15,335
and negative five. So these must be the answer and we could have switched these

5
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:19,417
around. I could have had the 4 over here and the negative 5 on this side too.

6
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:24,001
These are the factor pairs for negative 24. I want to find the factor pair that

7
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:28,390
has a sum of negative 5. That would be 3 and negative 8. So those set is to be

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,037
my factors. Here are the factor pairs for negative 36. I've only made the first

9
00:00:33,037 --> 00:00:37,445
set negative. I know negative 4 and 9 sum to 5 so this should be my answers to

10
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:42,536
the number puzzle. Now if none of these factor pairs added to 5, I would have

11
00:00:42,536 --> 00:00:47,433
made this column positive and this column negative. Then I could continue

12
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:48,229
searching.
