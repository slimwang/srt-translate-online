00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,700
Let's give it a try ip
route show default.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,608
And here we see the ipv address of
the default gateway for this machine.

3
00:00:18,037 --> 00:00:23,440
If we use netstat-nr.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,544
See this address also there.

5
00:00:30,275 --> 00:00:31,436
If we try pinging it.

6
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:41,060
Looks like the ping time is about 0.3
0.4 millisecond since pretty fast.
