1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,152
Now, to indicate that we want the positive and the negative versions of a

2
00:00:04,152 --> 00:00:08,780
number, we can write this symbol out in front, plus or minus. Now, in MathQuill,

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,274
to create this symbol, you need to write backslash pm and then a space. The next

4
00:00:13,274 --> 00:00:17,396
step, like we said, is going to be to take the square root of both sides.

5
00:00:17,397 --> 00:00:21,245
Including both the positive and the negative routes. I've already dealt with the

6
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:23,995
left side for you and I'd like you to fill in the right side.
