Excellent job so far.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,750
I really hope you're excited about the new tricks that you've learned.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,050
For this quiz, I want you to use the .each method to add the number of

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,620
characters held inside these p tags to the end of them.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,600
In other words, a number should appear at the end of

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,558
the p tag indicating the number of characters inside it.

7
00:00:20,558 --> 00:00:26,020
The .each method lets you iterate through a jQuery collection and

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,550
run a function, like so, against each DOM element.

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,400
It's kind of like a super awesome for loop that iterates over your elements.

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,270
I'll give you a hint.

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,410
If you want to use any of the jQuery methods on a DOM element

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,560
within the function that you pass in, you'll need

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,860
to use the $(this) selector to get that current element within your loop.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,350
Without reselecting using the jQuery object, the keyword this simply refers to

15
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,488
the DOM element itself without all of jQuery's additional functionality.

16
00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:04,040
For instance, $(this).text inside of an each loop will

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,610
return the text of each element as each iterates through the jQuery collection.

18
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,100
Take a look at the documentation for .each and add some numbers to your page.
