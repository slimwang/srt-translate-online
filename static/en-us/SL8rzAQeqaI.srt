1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,860
Using Android Auto is easy.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,570
Users go to the Play Store and

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,510
download apps onto their phone
that support Android Auto.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,440
They then connect their phone to their
car, the phone goes in the car mode, and

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,290
casts the Android Auto
experience to the car's screen.

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,990
This means that although all the apps
and services are actually running on

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,000
the phone, they're displayed in the
car's dash and you interact with them

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,500
using the vehicle's controls such as
a built-in touch screen and microphone.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,130
Now because of this,
you don't need to write a new app.

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,060
Instead, you can just extend
your existing Android apps

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,750
to work in the car.

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,740
Now there are two great use cases for
this today: audio and messaging.

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,200
Audio apps such as music,
radio, and audiobook players,

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,070
which are awesome way to stay
entertained while you're driving,

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,380
can now be extended into the car.

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,810
The APIs are available to expose
content, receive playback control, and

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,600
customize the UI.

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,490
Messaging applications,
which are a great way to stay connected

19
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,820
while you're driving,
can now be extended to the car as well.

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,600
APIs are available to
show notifications,

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,860
play back the message, and
even reply with speech.
