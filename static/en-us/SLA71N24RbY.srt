00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,344
Since we have a base of 2 over here for our exponent, we need to use a log of

2
00:00:04,344 --> 00:00:09,347
base 2, since that's the inverse. Now we've done this before, so I'm just going

3
00:00:09,347 --> 00:00:14,635
to write it out for you. That gives us log base 2 of 2 to the 3t minus 2 equals

4
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:20,597
log base 2 of 3. For now, I'd like us to leave the right-hand side as is. But

5
00:00:20,597 --> 00:00:24,815
what happens to the left-hand side if we simplify it? What belongs in this

6
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:25,419
space?
