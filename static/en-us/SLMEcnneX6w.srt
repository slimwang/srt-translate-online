00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Here's our optional unit. It involves programming and what I want is really simple.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I want to input a sample and a hypothesis and out should come

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
a simple yes or no whether whether I should accept it.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This piece of code should just do it,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and for simplicity I assume 95% confidence and two-sided-tests.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here's what I'll do. I'm going to give you functions you already know.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You've already programmed with the mean function. Here it is again.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Notice the use of the word float, in case the list doesn't have a float happens to be an artifact

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
of type conversions in Python, but never mind.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Then we have a variance function that you programmed before,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and here's the variance function in a very compact way.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And then, I also should really implement the T table but I was lazy so I'll just give 1.96,

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
even though we know that's not quite correct.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm going to give you a list. This was the list of height in my basketball club and I print the mean.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That is hard to see but I should indeed get 201.5. Give it a try.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What I want you to implement now is the function conf,

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
which is the plus/minus term in the confidence interval below and above the mean.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
If I run it for this data sequence over here from 199 to 204, I indeed get 1.366544.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So back in your code, we left the function conf open and please insert your code right here.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You can do this in one line.
