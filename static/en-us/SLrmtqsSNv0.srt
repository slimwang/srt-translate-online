1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,660
So let's talk a little bit about
vision in your visual field.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,469
So as you know, you've got two eyes,
well you started out with two eyes for

3
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:07,083
most of us.

4
00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:09,641
Each eye is about 160 degrees and

5
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:14,839
they overlap at about 120 degrees,
which means, if you do the math,

6
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,458
it means you have about 200
degrees total field of view.

7
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:20,950
Different animals are different,
by the way.

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,542
Some animals, the ones that are prey,
and supposed predator.

9
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:25,083
Their eyes are back here.

10
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,538
So they have a wider field of view,

11
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:29,045
and that is they can see more behind,
further behind them,

12
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:32,110
which you might want to do if
you're worried about a predator.

13
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,190
But of course,
it means you have less stereo vision.

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,890
But remember, we were talking
about nerves coming out and

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,420
crossing this area
called the optic chiasm?

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,090
Let's take a look at that
a little more carefully.

17
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,450
The human vision system does,

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,250
well you're probably quite familiar
with your motor control system, right?

19
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,440
That the left part of your brain
controls the right arm, and

20
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,840
the right part of your
brain controls the left.

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,070
And if you have a stroke on the left
side of your of your brain you'll,

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,060
you'll lose some motor function
also some sensory function.

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,780
Well, you probably didnt
stop to think about that

24
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,250
the eyes have a tricky problem, right?

25
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,792
So the stuff that I see over here is
seen in this eye and in this eye.

26
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:13,042
And the stuff I see over here is
seen in this eye and in that eye.

27
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:15,080
How does the brain deal with that?

28
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,510
Well, the way it does it is,
it actually splits the eyeball in half,

29
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,070
in terms of where
the projections come from.

30
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,830
So here we see the right visual field,

31
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,340
which is looked at by this
left side of the eye.

32
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,695
Which is the temporal side of the left
eye and the nasal side of the right eye.

33
00:01:32,695 --> 00:01:37,850
Tho, both of those come in
through the optic chiasm

34
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,640
going to the left side of your brain.

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,167
So the left side of your
brain is looking at

36
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:46,793
this stuff over here on the right
in both of the eyes, okay?

37
00:01:46,793 --> 00:01:51,611
And likewise, the right side of my right
eye and the right side of my left eye,

38
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,947
which is looking at the stuff
on the left-hand side,

39
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:58,083
is projected to the right-hand
side of my brain.

40
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:02,274
And so just the same way that your
sensation on your right arm is in your

41
00:02:02,274 --> 00:02:06,920
left brain, the sensation in your right
visual field is at your left brain.

42
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:13,450
Also in this other view of the sort
of the projection of the optic

43
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,380
system into the brain, you can see
these other structures, right?

44
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,890
So we get here to
the lateral geniculate,

45
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,240
again on both sides,
project into the superior colliculus.

46
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,010
And here you can see that there
are these projections out

47
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,810
to this whole area of visual
cortex which is in the back.

48
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,208
And we'll look at that.

49
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,429
One of the implications of
this right half, left half,

50
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:37,059
the right part of your brain looking
at the left half, vice versa, is if,

51
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:40,632
if you have a some sort of the
degeneracy or stroke or something, and

52
00:02:40,632 --> 00:02:44,029
let's say you were to lose some
function on one side of your brain

53
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:48,459
you'd experience what's referred to as
here it's written, hemifield neglect.

54
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,773
'Kay, and what that means is that,
so you've had a damage, let's say,

55
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,554
to the left side of your brain,

56
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:57,793
the whole right side area would
just sort of not be there.

57
00:02:57,793 --> 00:03:00,927
And what's interesting, and, and we'll
see an example of this a minute when we

58
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:04,280
talk about blind spots and stuff, you
don't feel like there's a hole there.

59
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,670
You just feel like this
is my field of view.

60
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,820
I don't actually know what's over there.

61
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,190
Okay, so it's not like right now
I feel there's a hole back here.

62
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,360
Despite what my wife says,
there's no hole in the back of my head,

63
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,270
I don't think.

64
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,720
But I just don't, I just know that
I can't see what's back there.

65
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,160
Well what happens is if your brain
sort of starts not knowing what's over

66
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,496
here, it just kind of, you know,
it just doesn't worry about it.

67
00:03:26,496 --> 00:03:29,980
You know and in fact, what will happen
is that it'll fill in some stuff for

68
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,510
a little bit, kind of like you do
with the rest of your visual field.

69
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,790
We'll talk about that in a minute too.

70
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,883
But, but I don't want you to get a sense
that you would feel like there was

71
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:39,930
a great big black hole
sitting over there.
