1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,780
The missing side length is 27 units. Great work if you found that number.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,135
Again, we'll start with the right triangle and this time we'll have one side of

3
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:15,558
36 and a hypotenuse of 45. Remember the hypotenuse needs to be right directly

4
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:21,220
across from the 90 degree angle. This means that this missing side link must be

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,794
x. We'll square the legs and sum those together to get the square of the

6
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:34,188
hypotenuse. So we'll have x squared plus 1,296 equals 2,025. We'll subtract

7
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:40,338
1,296 from both sides of the equation to get x squared equals 729. Now we can

8
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:45,279
take the square root of both sides, keeping only the positive root, so x is

9
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:50,608
equal to 27. The other way to solve this problem is to use the special triangle

10
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:56,640
3, 4, 5. If we were to multiply each of these numbers by 9, we would get 36 and

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,433
we would get 45. This must mean that 9 has to be the multiplier for each of the

12
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:08,560
side lengths. So to find this missing piece, we simply multiply 3 by 9 to get

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,581
27. Again, this is why it's helpful sometimes to know the pythagorean triples.

14
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:16,950
If you know a couple of them it might make your problem solving easier.
