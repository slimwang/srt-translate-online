00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,224
Because all of our entities are simulated using physics bodies, we lack the

2
00:00:03,224 --> 00:00:07,160
ability to simply move our player to our desired position. This type of

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,332
teleportation can cause issues with your physics environment, mainly,

4
00:00:10,332 --> 00:00:13,972
teleported objects ignore physics calculations until after their teleportation

5
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:18,570
has been resolved. For instance, if we move the player to a teleported position

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,860
which is intersected at the wall we could potentially get stuck there. And then

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,868
confuse the PhysicsEngine on what to do next, since the player is, of course,

8
00:00:25,868 --> 00:00:29,810
stuck. As such, rather than teleporting the player we need to update it's

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,190
velocity such that the PhysicsEngine moves that unit to where we want it to go,

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:39,599
next update loop. Now all of our players actually have an mpPhysBody variable.

11
00:00:39,599 --> 00:00:42,383
This physics body is given to us on the instantiation of the player, by

12
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:46,587
allocating it from the PhysicsEngine. Since we can't set the physics body

13
00:00:46,587 --> 00:00:50,085
position directly, due to teleportation issues, what we do instead is a little

14
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:54,478
bit of a workaround. We take advantage of the fact that the PhysicsEngine is

15
00:00:54,478 --> 00:00:58,900
going to update all of the physics bodies that it owns every frame. The physics

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,445
bodies themselves allow you to define a velocity vector on them. When the

17
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:06,855
PhysicsEngine updates, it adjusts the position of the physics body by the

18
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:11,330
vector, moving it correctly. We, in GRITS can take advantage of this. By

19
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,230
supplying a velocity vector that will move our physics body to the position we

20
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,310
want it to be in. Avoiding the teleportation issues.
