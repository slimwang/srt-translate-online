1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,100
This class is really built
around the projects.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,320
And while there are some details that'll
change from semester to semester,

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,380
there's some principals that
we anticipate staying true for

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,630
the long run.

5
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,020
The first is that this project
is very open ended and

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,240
you have a lot of leeway to
specify what you want to work on.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,590
You might choose to do some research,
you might choose to build a tool.

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,008
You might choose to investigate
a current technology,

9
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:23,050
you have a lot of room to decide what
you want to work on for the project.

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,810
You'll propose it yourself, scope it
out, develop a plan and then execute it.

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,760
Second, these projects are intended
to be real contributions to the field

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,310
of educational technology, and so
we want to do as much as possible within

13
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,550
the semester to get them ready
to take out into the world.

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,370
So, this class will culminate in a paper
ready for publication in the conference

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,470
or journal most pertinent to
the work you do in this class.

16
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,240
You don't have to submit it,
of course, but

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,490
we want to have all the work done for
you, so

18
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,650
that if you would like to take that
next step, you are already ready.

19
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,100
I'll judge the success of this class
based on the extent to which it

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,010
generates publications, research
programs, start up businesses or

21
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,670
tools that we can use here
in the OMSES program.

22
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,810
And third, just as these projects
are intended to be real contributions to

23
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,660
the field of educational technology,

24
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,540
we'd like to treat
them as such ourselves.

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,060
So with your permission, we'd like to
include your projects in our course

26
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,850
library, to provide to future
students in this course.

27
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,490
Maybe they'll borrow from your ideas.

28
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,140
Or maybe, some of them might
even pick up your project and

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:16,940
take it to the next step.
