00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,069
So I searched Google for, how to center align a button vertically and

2
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:05,860
horizontally in an iPhone app.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,780
And after a bit of browsing, I landed on this blog which addressed the issue.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,135
By the way, a link to this blog is also available in the instructor notes.

5
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:18,000
There I learned that on my storyboard,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,930
there is this super tiny button here at the bottom called Document Outline.

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,440
Let me just quickly go ahead and center my storyboard one more time.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,740
Now, I know that there is a lot of new information here on the Document Outline,

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,330
but for now I only want to you to focus on the things that we've added already.

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,860
Things like the Record Button and the view that it is enclosed within.

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,970
Now, to center this button horizontally, what I will do is select the button and

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,260
then I will hold the Control Key down on my keyboard and

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,800
start dragging from the button in this direction, and let go.

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,610
And here I will select the option that says, Center Horizontally in Container.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,350
Done.

16
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,330
To center vertically, I will hold the Control Key down on

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,370
my keyboard one more time and start dragging from my button in this direction,

18
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,370
and then select, Center Vertically in Container.

19
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,830
There.

20
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,380
Now, what we are doing here is adding something called constraints.

21
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,850
This is XCodes way of putting things at a precise location on your phone.

22
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,220
You can see here in the document outline that we have added two constraints.

23
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,710
A center x alignment, and a y alignment.

24
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,302
Okay.

25
00:01:31,302 --> 00:01:33,680
So I'm going to go ahead and run my app and see if it worked.

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,410
It says, Stop Pitch Perfect?

27
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,310
Oh, the simulator is already running, so

28
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,970
I'll say Stop, and then it will restart it.

29
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,200
Aha, there is the Record Button.

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,450
This time in the center of the phone.

31
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,530
Now if for some reason I want to delete these constraints,

32
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,120
all I have to do is select them, and hit Delete on my keyboard.

33
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,480
There, gone.

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,350
Let me stop the app and run it one more time.

35
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,360
And we can see that the Record Button is not aligned anymore.

36
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,980
So I'm going to go back and add the constraints, but

37
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,700
this time, I will use this tiny button here at the bottom which says Align.

38
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,597
I will select the button, and then click on Align, and

39
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:15,866
say Horizontal Centering Container and Vertical Centering Container.

40
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:18,170
And then I will add the two constraints.

41
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,360
There. Let me stop the simulator and

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,190
run the app again, and boom, our button is in the center.
