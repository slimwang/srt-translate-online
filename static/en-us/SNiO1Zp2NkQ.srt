00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,790
Activity diagram. Well that's the one that's, of course, there's a flow

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,310
of control from activity to activity. As far as the sequence diagram, that's

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,710
an interaction of classes in terms of message exchanges. Communication diagram.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,320
That's object interaction in terms of numbered messages. Interaction overview.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,530
Synthesis of lower level behavioral diagrams. Timing diagram.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,090
Well that's the rotated sequence diagram.

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,810
That's also going to have specific time laid out on it. The use case diagram,

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,870
well that system functionality provided to its external actors.

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,914
And the state diagram, that's dynamic behavior in response to stimuli.
