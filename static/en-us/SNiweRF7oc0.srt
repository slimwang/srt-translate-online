00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This type of diagram--called a slope field--helps to understand why everything is determined

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
once we fix a certain initial amount of fish in this case.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The general term would be initial value.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
These arrows point in the direction in which our solution curve has to run at every point in time

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and every amount fish we could draw such an arrow.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This arrow specifies the rate of change.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Here the rate of change is slightly positive. Here it's approximately zero.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Here it's slightly negative and here it is really hugely negative.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
To see what this system is doing, we simply follow these arrows or take this one here as an initial value.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We first have to go down and then move from between here.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Once you have specified the initial condition to initial value in this case the initial amount of fish,

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
you can trace out such a solution curve that describes the dependency of the amount of fish

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
on time or whatever your differential equation is about.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There is such a solution curve and there is no second solution curve. This would not work.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is what mathematicians mean when they speak of existence and uniqueness of the solution.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Once you specified the initial condition, there is a solution curve and there is only one solution curve.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Well, unless I have to say first thing that may happen is that the solution escapes infinity

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
in finite time then we don't know how to continue afterward or the solution may fall into a hole

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
of the definition set of our equations.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
For instance imagine that we are simulating a machine and we do not have any idea about

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
what's happening to the machine in this region then we can't continue either.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The following quiz shows that this escape to infinity in finite time can happen easily.
