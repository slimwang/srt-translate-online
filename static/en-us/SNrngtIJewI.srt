00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,330
You can create more interesting
movement by animating multiple objects,

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,380
or even the children of an item
as the parent itself moves.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,170
In this example, the cards move
onto screen at different speeds,

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,330
helping to convey that
they are separate items.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,960
When doing this, it's key that you do so
in a coordinated matter, here

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,200
we are achieving coordinated motion by
using a consistent direction and timing.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,530
All cards move in from the bottom of
the screen, from different distances,

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,110
which causes the closing up effect.

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,140
Because they use the same duration and
interpolator, the acceleration and

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,550
deceleration will link
them perceptively,

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,200
thanks to the gestalt laws of
grouping that we looked at earlier.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,190
When moving multiple
items at the same time,

13
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,280
be mindful to choreograph their
paths in a cohesive direction.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,460
In this exaggerated example, each card
arrives from a different direction,

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,080
appearing chaotic.

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,000
Try sketching out the paths that items
will travel upon to check that they

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,710
are coordinated, avoiding overlapping
paths in conflicting directions.

18
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,090
In the real world,
few items move in a linear fashion, so

19
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,750
using linear motion can feel robotic and
unnatural.

20
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,020
In this example clicking on an item
performs a shared element transition

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,330
on the circle.

22
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,240
Notice that the difference between
this straight line transition and

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,130
curved transition.

24
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,370
The latter feels more natural.

25
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,600
Be judicious with this technique
as it can attract attention, so

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,090
make sure it's used when
that is your intention.

27
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,720
As we've seen, material surfaces
can transform their size,

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,870
shape, and position.

29
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,760
We've also seen how an items elevation
shows hierarchy and importance.

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,260
When animating a change
in size of an item,

31
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,990
you want to avoid having
your users mistake this for

32
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,970
a zoom effect, which might imply
an elevation change, like this example.

33
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,650
A good way to do this,
is to animate the width, and

34
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:59,340
the height at different rates,
making it clear what is changing.

35
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,600
Check the instructor's notes for

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,350
the source of these examples
to see how they are achieved.
