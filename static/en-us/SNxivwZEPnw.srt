Our answer is similar to the question before, we get plus or minus 5i. I'll show

2
00:00:04,246 --> 00:00:08,282
you the work that I did to get this. So again, I went through the same process

3
00:00:08,282 --> 00:00:12,438
as in the question before. Separating the factors under the radical, into the

4
00:00:12,438 --> 00:00:16,596
positive and negative parts, which then gave me a real factor, and an imaginary

5
00:00:16,596 --> 00:00:20,652
factor. And of course, we can't forget that plus or minus sign, since we're

6
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:22,683
taking the square root of both sides.
