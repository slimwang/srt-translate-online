1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,580
Okay, so now we're going to do
something slightly different here.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,839
We have a set of views that
will be our header, and

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,539
at the bottom there's another
set of views, the footer.

4
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:15,919
Right in the middle we have a text view,
although it could be

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:21,100
any other kind of view, whose job
is to keep header and footer apart.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,290
Sounds easy as pie.

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:22,969
Let's give it a try.

8
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:27,649
Before we start,
remember the guiding principles.

9
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:30,859
Start small, and
work from the inside out.

10
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:35,945
So first of all, let's create the header
with two labels and two text fields.

11
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:39,293

12
00:00:39,293 --> 00:00:41,851
Now let's apply the second
commandment and

13
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:44,719
put these two guys inside of stack view.

14
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,269
By now you should understand
why the text field shrank.

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,970
Let's create another one for
the last name.

16
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,579
Put them inside a stack view.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,679
Let's combine them both using the second
commandment and create the header.

18
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:04,349
Select both stack views, and
put them inside of another stack view.

19
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,511
Now let's make a row of buttons for
the footer.

20
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,911
[BLANK_AUDIO]

21
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:13,968
Let's put these guys
inside a stack view and

22
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:17,809
now we'll create the text
view in the middle.

23
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,388
Let's finish up by combining
everything into our main stack view,

24
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:24,606
and add the constraints needed
to make it stick to the edges.

25
00:01:24,606 --> 00:01:31,968
[BLANK_AUDIO]

26
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:34,379
Okay, so this is easy to fix.

27
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:37,640
Update frames, fix misplacement.

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,390
And this is what we get.

29
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,810
Well, it did seem easy, but
it didn't turn out very well.

30
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,490
Take a deep breath and recall
the last principle of auto layout.

31
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:49,489
Don't panic.

32
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:54,500
Pause the video and make a list
of everything that went wrong.

33
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,040
We'll be fixing it in the next video
