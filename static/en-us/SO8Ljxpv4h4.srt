1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,162
So if we did multiply each of these terms by 2 x what new equation would we get

2
00:00:05,162 --> 00:00:09,468
here? Keep in mind that when we multiply through by the LCD we're really going

3
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:13,177
to clear each of these fractions. That's the goal. We want to get something

4
00:00:13,177 --> 00:00:14,649
that's more simple to work with.
