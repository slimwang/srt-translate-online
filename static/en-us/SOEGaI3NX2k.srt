00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,360
In this problem we've been tasked with finding a bug. Sounds

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,250
pretty straightforward, and we've done this before, but this time we're

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,790
mixing it up a bit, and not giving you access to

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,170
the source code. We didn't really give you too much guidance

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,300
on how to do this, but, believe it or not, this

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,340
is actually a pretty common thing you're going to have to do

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,980
in the real world. Having access to the source code, or

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,210
the implementation itself, is often more rare than it is common.

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,120
Plus, sometimes even with the source code, it can be so

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,580
unfamiliar or poorly documented that it's, might as well not be having

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,680
it all. With that said, let's look at the problem. So

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,440
here we have the code to test the problem and below we

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,830
have the give and test case. Now e told you somewhere

14
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,100
in here lies the bug. One way to narrow it down, was

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,640
to look at each of these hypotheses and then test them

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,250
one by one. I'm going to show you a quick test case that

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,520
gets right to the bug. Here, I've inserted the

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,050
code from homework six, debugging environments and when I

19
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,180
run that code, I see the same bug that

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,650
we saw in homework six. This implies, and you

21
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,390
can further verify on your own, the problem is

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,970
right here, where we're not passing in the right

23
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,690
function environment when we're executing a function. So, bug

24
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,260
equals seven is the answer and just in case you're

25
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,480
curious, here's the source code for the expression evaluation, and

26
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,740
if we look at call, we'll see that the environment that

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,400
we call the function on is the same environment from

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,760
which its called and not from which the function was defined.
