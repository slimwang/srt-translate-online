00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,075
Using isinstance we could define the Bear chase like this. We'll first check if

2
00:00:05,075 --> 00:00:08,832
the victims up a tree if not he is definitely eatable. If he is up a tree well

3
00:00:08,832 --> 00:00:12,931
it depends whether a Black Bear or a Grizzly Bear. If we're a Black Bear we

4
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:16,093
climb the tree, if we're a Grizzly Gear we knock down the tree. Either of those

5
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:19,522
makes the victim eatable. If not, the victim is not eatable. We don't have a

6
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:23,365
way, to get to the victim if we're some, weak kind of Bear that can't do either

7
00:00:23,365 --> 00:00:27,164
of those two things. Then, if the victim's eatable, we eat the victim, but

8
00:00:27,164 --> 00:00:32,342
otherwise there's no dinner for the Bear. Very sad,[SOUND] no dinner, no dinner.

9
00:00:32,342 --> 00:00:36,230
So think about how you like that code. I'm going to show you another possible

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,243
way to deal with this.
