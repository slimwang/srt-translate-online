1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,810
So, passwords are hashed. Are you completely safe? No. Sorry to

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,880
lead you down this path. We have, we have more to

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,250
do. The problem is, there are, you know, a handful of

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,250
good hashing algorithms that people would use for this sort of

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,890
thing. You know, let's, let's, let's pretend we're using SHA-256, because

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,620
that's a pretty decent algorithm. If somebody were to go through

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,740
and create a mapping of every word to the hash of

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,920
that word. That would be a problem. because remember the whole strength

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,340
of this hashing problem is that it's really hard to

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,700
get from the hash to the plain text that led to

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,490
that hash. You know, to, if you have H of a,

12
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,110
you know, the hash of a. It's really hard to figure

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,420
out a. But if you've got already computed it for every

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,720
word, and all you have to do is you know compute

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,860
at once and create the inverse table. Once somebody has this

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,007
table of all this words computed once, they're done. You know,

17
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:53,604
if you created a mapping of you know the SHA-256 of

18
00:00:53,604 --> 00:00:56,148
every word to the original word, all of a sudden you get,

19
00:00:56,148 --> 00:00:59,115
you get a database of a bunch of SHA-256 passwords. You can

20
00:00:59,115 --> 00:01:02,620
look up what the password is instantly. And this table has a

21
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,560
name. It's called a rainbow table. There are these things, these mappings,

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,330
these databases of a hash version of a password to the clear

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,440
text password, they exist. You can Google for a rainbow table for

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,340
a hash algorithm of your choice, you know, download that hash table

25
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,760
or, you know, download that mapping, turn it into a hash table and

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,160
you're good to go. There's a very simple way to get around this. You

27
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,970
may remember from our cookie approach, that all we have to do is

28
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,840
add in some secrets. But we don't want to add in the same secret over

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,170
and over again. Otherwise, you're basically

30
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,970
vulnerable to the same fairly similar technique.

31
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,390
So what we do instead is we use something called a salt. So in

32
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,370
our user table, we're storing our name, and we're storing a hash of

33
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,870
the password. Instead of storing just a

34
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,350
hash of the password, we're going to add.

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,560
A secret to it. It's similar to how we

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,620
did with the cookies except this is not really secret.

37
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,920
We're just going to say this hash is going to equal our

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,160
hashing function of the password plus salt. And this

39
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,890
salt, instead of, so this looks very similar to

40
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,640
what we did with the cookies. Right? We were using

41
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,200
HMAC and, and we had a password, and, and a

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,610
secret. Except the salt is just. It's just some random

43
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,490
characters we make up. You can make them up

44
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,040
and you store them in the hash field, in the

45
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,840
clear. So, in this field, we'll, we'll actually have

46
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,010
the hash. Now this abbreviated as H and right along

47
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,890
with it we'll have the salt and what this

48
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,230
does is, is this prevents this quick lookup from working

49
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,680
because all of a sudden we've added this these random

50
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,560
strings. So, instead of saying hash of a equals a,

51
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,590
we have to figure out what's, well what's hash of

52
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,540
a you know, plus the salt. And all of a sudden

53
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,990
that table's completely invalid. So, when you store a user. You

54
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,040
know this is the type of algorithm you can do. Now,

55
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,360
outside of this class I want you to think very hard

56
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,100
about doing this yourself. You know as with all crypto you

57
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,920
should probably not being implementing it yourself because people have thought

58
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,640
this through. They have done it securely and you are not

59
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,910
yet qualified to do so. I want you to think very

60
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,708
hard. About using third party libraries, because a lot of third party

61
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:08,485
libraries also get this wrong. So, basically, think very hard. You

62
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:11,855
want to get this right. There's a couple more things I'll tell you

63
00:03:11,855 --> 00:03:14,452
to look for when you're evaluating a third party library, but

64
00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:16,706
a lot of them really screw this up, and you don't want to

65
00:03:16,706 --> 00:03:19,891
just trust them blindly, so. You know, I'd rather you do

66
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:22,663
it yourself knowing how to do it than you trust a third

67
00:03:22,663 --> 00:03:25,372
party library blindly, but the best knowledge you

68
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,884
can have is what to look for in

69
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:29,380
a third party authentication library. Let's go ahead

70
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,970
and implement some naive functions for, you know, hashing

71
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,200
and salting a password so you can see how the, the flow works. And then we'll

72
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,890
talk about some of the things you should

73
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,936
look for when you're evaluating you know somebody's approach.
