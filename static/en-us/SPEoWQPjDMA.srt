00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,550
The sixth issue you have to deal with in doing object design,

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,690
is how you're going to implement control. Recall then,

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,600
in your analysis model, you may have some state charts. Those state charts

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,649
describe the allowable behavior of objects of a particular class.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,650
How are you going to implement that behavior? Regardless of how you do it,

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,970
recall that the state that you're dealing with, is essentially,

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:35,410
the possible values of the class's attributes. The ad hoc approach merely says,

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:42,300
write the code, okay? Treat it as each particular situation,

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,140
that is each state is detected and you take appropriate events.

10
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,320
So you are essentially implementing by hand that, that state chart.

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,590
Fortunately, there are more productive ways to spend your time.

12
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:03,780
There are libraries that already exist that support finite state modeling,

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,030
finite state implementations and you can make use of one of those or

14
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,750
as an intermediate step you could write your own table driven interpreter.

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,670
That is the table rows have particular situations that you're in and

16
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,260
corresponding events or

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,460
inputs that might arise and the table then tells you what to do or

18
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,660
what to call when that particular, that particular situation obtains
