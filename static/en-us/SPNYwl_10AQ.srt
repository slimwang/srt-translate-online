00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,120
Let's quickly check that you
understand this definition of bitonic.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,280
Here are two sequences.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,480
Which of these is bitonic?

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,420
Note that the answer might be only one,
none, or both.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,500
Take the sequences and
try to apply this formal definition.
