1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,145
So I've got the site open on my mobile
device, and I will start tapping.

2
00:00:04,145 --> 00:00:07,990
Okay, so did you see that?

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,870
It goes aqua then pink.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,570
So Aqua is active, and pink is actually
HotPink, and that means hover.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,389
Notice that no matter what you do,
you don't see FireBrick showing up.

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,740
But that was on an iOS device.

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,870
I wonder if it's any different
on an Android device?

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,870
Let's see.

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,900
Okay, so it goes Aqua,
then FireBrick, interesting.

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,595
Last time on the iOS device,
I didn't see FireBrick.

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,910
I wonder if HotPink is there?

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,200
If I press down on a button and

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,010
then slide my finger off,
the HotPink shows up.

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,620
Which means that hover
is actually there too.

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,920
So on Android you have all three.

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,410
So the correct answer is, actually,

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,990
none of them because different mobile
devices behave slightly differently.

18
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,360
It's worth keeping this in mind as you
develop your sites to look good on

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,740
any device.

20
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,360
You're starting to think
about forms with touch,

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,280
which is a distinctly human interaction.

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,090
In the next video,

23
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,020
watch Luke describe how the human body
becomes a factor with mobile devices.
