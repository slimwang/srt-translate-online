1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now I want you to define the successor function for this problem.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We'll give you a hint that a state is of that form.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Return all the successors. The successors should be a dictionary as before.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We want to include successor states that result in cannibals being able to eat,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but such a state should have no successors itself.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In other words, we're free to generate a successor state that has, say,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
two cannibals and one missionary in one location,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but if we're given such a state then we should return the empty dictionary of successors.
