1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
[Thrun] And the answer will be 0.6, 0.44, and 0.376.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's really an exercise applying probability theory.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the very beginning we know to be in state R,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and the probability of remaining there is 0.6, which is directly the value on the arc over here.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
On the second state we know that the probability of R is 0.6

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and therefore, the probability of sun is 0.4,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and we compute the probability of rain on day 2 using total probability.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The probability of rain on day 2 given rain on day 1

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
times the probability of rain on day 1 plus the probability of rain on day 2

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
given it was sunny on day 1 times the probability of sun on day 1.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And if you plug in all these values,

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
we get 0.6 times 0.6 plus rain following sun which is this arc over here, 0.2,

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
times 0.4 as the prior, and this results in 0.44.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We can now do the same with the probability of rain on day 3,

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
which is the same 0.6 over here, but now our prior is different--it's 0.44--

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
plus the same 0.2 over here with the prior of 0.56, which is 1 minus 0.44.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And when you work this all out, it is 0.376 as indicated over here.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So what we really learned here is that this is a temporal Bayes network

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
of which we can apply conventional probabilities such as the total probability

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
which was also known as variable elimination in the Bayes network lecture.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
All these fancy words aside, it's really easy to evaluate those.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So if you want to do this and you ask yourself given the probability of the certain time step

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
like 1, what's it related to time step 2,

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
you ask yourself what's the durations that I encounter in time step 1.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There are usually 2 in this case.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What are the transition probabilities that lead me to the desired state in time step 2

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
like the 0.6 if you started in R and 0.2 if you started in S,

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and you add all these cases up and you just get the right number.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It's really an easy piece of mathematics if you think about it.
