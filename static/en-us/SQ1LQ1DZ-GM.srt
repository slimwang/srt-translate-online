00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,010
In the next few minutes, I'm going to throw a couple more vocabulary words into

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,760
our mix. First I want to talk about a special kind of expression. In fact,

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,080
the kind that we've seen most up to this time.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,405
These are polynomials. A polynomial is an expression, made up of constants,

5
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:20,017
variables, or both, that are combined using addition, subtraction, or

6
00:00:20,017 --> 00:00:23,228
multiplication. So this basically means that we have one or

7
00:00:23,228 --> 00:00:26,457
more terms, like we've talked about before, added together.

8
00:00:26,457 --> 00:00:32,020
The variables in a polynomial also have to have non-negative integer exponents.

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,265
So as an example of a polynomial, we might have something like 5 x cubed minus

10
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:42,844
one-half x y plus 7. Or maybe z plus 6 z squared, minus 7 plus 9 x cubed,

11
00:00:42,844 --> 00:00:47,430
plus 8 x to the 5th. So, some polynomials that we see will have more than one

12
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,810
variable in them, like these two right here. But often times, we'll also see

13
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,482
polynomials that have just one variable involved, or maybe even none. So,

14
00:00:54,482 --> 00:00:59,411
an example of that might be something like 4 n cubed plus 3 n squared plus 1.

15
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:04,004
But again, any combination of constants in variables using these operators, and

16
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:06,900
only these kind of exponents, makes a polynomial.
