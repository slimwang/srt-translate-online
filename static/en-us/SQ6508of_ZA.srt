00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this problem, we're given a dictionary where the keys are children

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and the values are a list of parents,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and given a person, we want to go through the dictionary,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and calculate a list that contains all of that person's ancestors.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So let's go over the plan.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're going to use recursion.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We're going to find the person that we're searching for in the dictionary.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We're going to add that person's parents, their direct relatives, to the output list,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and then we're going to recurse on the parents to find the ancestors,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
adding the result of this recursive call to our output list.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This should be enough to get started,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
so let's go right to the editor.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If the person we're searching for is in the genealogy dictionary,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
we're going to do what we described previously.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If they're not in the dictionary, we're going to return an empty list

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
because we don't know any of their ancestors.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So for each parent, we're going to add their ancestors to the result list,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and once we're done, we're going to return the result list. And that's it.
