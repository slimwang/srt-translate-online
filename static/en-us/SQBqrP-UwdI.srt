1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,680
A closely related challenge is
accurate patient identification

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,650
across providers and health systems.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,420
Countries like France solved
this problem by issuing

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,940
a Special Health Smart card.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,370
Here in the US
a National Identity Number or card for

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:22,500
Healthcare is a controversial issue that
is unlikely to be solved anytime soon.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,220
So, absent one knowing if
John Smith at Hospital A,

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,080
is the same patient as John A.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,945
Smith at Hospital B can be hard.

10
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:37,040
Cross-enterprise health
information exchange

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,480
depends on master patient
indices that use sophisticated

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,450
algorithms designed to solve this
problem as accurately as possible.
