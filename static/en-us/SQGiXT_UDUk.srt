1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,103
So, we have seen that we want
the cache to be small and fast,

2
00:00:04,103 --> 00:00:07,661
but not too small because then
it keeps very little stuff.

3
00:00:07,661 --> 00:00:09,590
So, that it has very few hits.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,910
So, what are the cache sizes that
we have actually observed in real

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,170
processors.

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,220
There is a complication there,
in that modern processors.

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,830
Usually have several
caches not just one.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,380
So depending on which
cache are we talking about

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,040
it might be larger or smaller.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,030
So let's look at caches that we call L1,
or level one caches which are the caches

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,500
that directly service the read and
write requests from the processor.

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,850
So when the processor wants to read or

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,239
write, it first goes to the L1
cache to check if it has a hit.

14
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,160
If the L1 cache has a miss, then things
get complicated because before we go to

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,470
the main memory, we go to other caches.

16
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,320
And in several lessons,
we will actually see how that works.

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,940
But for now, let's just see how
big are these level one caches.

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,300
In recent processors,

19
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,180
typical sizes of the L1 cache
have been 16 to 64 kilobytes.

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,349
This is large enough to get about
90% hit rate, meaning only one-tenth

21
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:09,230
of all the accesses from the processor
end up going beyond this cache.

22
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:14,102
Yet, these are still small enough to
have the hit time that is equal to

23
00:01:14,102 --> 00:01:16,840
1 to 3 processor cycles.

24
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,870
So we spend very few
process cycles waiting for

25
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,890
the data to come back from this cache,
if it's a hit.

26
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,400
Recall that memories have hundreds
of cycles, co this is very,

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,710
very fast compared to the memory.
