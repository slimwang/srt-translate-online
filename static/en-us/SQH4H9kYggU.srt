00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,940
The fundamental problem with server selection is determining

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,790
which server to direct the client to. One

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,189
could do this based on a number of

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,350
criteria, such as the least loaded sever, the one

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,030
with the lowest network latency or simply to

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,790
any alive server to help provide fault times.

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,950
Content distribution networks typically aim to direct clients

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,210
towards servers that provide the lowest latency. For the

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,000
reasons that we talked about before, since latency plays a

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,479
hugely significant role, in the web performance that clients see.
