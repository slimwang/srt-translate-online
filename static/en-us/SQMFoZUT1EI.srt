1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,680
So now let's see if we understood what are all the things that happen in

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,820
one cycle in [UNKNOWN] algorithm. Suppose that this is the situation we have at

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,250
the beginning of a cycle. We have an instruction that is waiting to be issued in

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,240
the instruction queue. This is the contents of the RAT. These are the values for

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,580
the Registers. These are the Reservation Stations. Two of them are occupied.

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,070
One is still available. And the instruction in the reservation station 0 is

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,810
executing in the ALU and during this cycle it will broadcast it's result.

8
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,930
Which is 4.4. This is what is allowed to happen in the same cycle,

9
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,700
issuing and then dispatching the instruction cannot happen in the same cycle.

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,655
Capturing a result and then dispatching can happen in this particular processor.

11
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:58,920
And then, issuing and broadcasting of a result for the same RAT entry,

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,161
is of course, also allowed. The first part of this quiz

13
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:09,603
is at the end of the cycle. Whose beginning we are looking at here.

14
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:14,400
What will be the content of the two RAT entries and the two registers?

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,710
So after the end of this cycle, what's going to be here, here, here, and here?
