00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's look at dynamic programming again.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Specifically let's look at environment that has a loop.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Here's the environment.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The environment possesses 14 states,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and here is the loop as indicated, and there is a big intersection in the middle over here.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's assume this is our start state in the very south, and we're facing north.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We we reach to the goal state in the west, and here we will be facing west.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Obviously, there are two ways to get to the goal.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We can go north 3 steps and then turn left to the goal,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
or we can take the entire loop over here, avoid left turns,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but eventually find ourselves at the goal as well after more steps.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's assume there are different costs attached.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The cost of motion is -1 per red cell.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The cost of right turns is -2.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Why would be penalize right turns?

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, as you turn right, you might have to yield for pedestrians.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That might cost you some time.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's assume an expectation that -2 accounts for the time relative to the motion of -1.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What I'd like you to know is a tricky question.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What is the max cost of a left turn?

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If we avoid left turns altogether, we'd much rather take the loop over here.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I want the solution where you turn left to be distinctly more expensive, or more negative,

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
than the solution where you turn right.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
When I say "max", we're dealing with negative numbers.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So if you would were to look into positive numbers, what's the minimum cost of a left turn?

26
00:01:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
But I want you to enter the negative number over here.
