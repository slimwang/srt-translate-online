1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,640
Another method that we could use to impute missing

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,700
values in a data set is to perform linear regression

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,320
to estimate the missing values. We'll cover linear regression

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,080
in more depth in the next lesson. But the general

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,770
idea is that we would create an equation that

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,060
predicts missing values in the data using information we do

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,080
have, and then use that equation to fill in our

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,670
missing values. Okay so, what are the drawbacks of using

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,480
this linear regression type technique? Well, one negative

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,690
side effect of imputing missing values in this

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,600
way is that we would over emphasize existing

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,580
trends in the data. For example, if, if

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,740
there is a relationship between date of birth

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,390
and height in MLB players, all of our

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,300
imputed values will amplify this trend. Additionally, this

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,940
model will produce exact values for the missing entries,

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,690
which would suggest a greater certainty in the missing values than

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,500
we actually have. In any case, let's say we did want

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,790
to fill in the missing values for weight in our baseball

20
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,580
player data. We could train a linear model using the existing

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,890
data that we have, and then use that model to fill

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,842
in these missing values. Let's say we did want to fill

23
00:01:09,842 --> 00:01:12,438
in the missing values for weight in our baseball data. We

24
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:15,949
could train a linear model using our existing data. That is,

25
00:01:15,949 --> 00:01:19,009
entries that have position, left or right

26
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:23,599
handed batter, average, birthdate, deathdate, height and

27
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:25,779
weight. And then use that model that

28
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:28,410
we've created to fill in these missing values.
