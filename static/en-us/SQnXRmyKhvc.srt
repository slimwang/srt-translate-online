1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,770
So I've opened up the Parallax
demo from before.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,670
And I've got DevTools open.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,620
I'll click on show paint rectangles and
now I will scroll.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,500
And you can see that the entire
page is lighting up in green.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,650
Which means that there is
a lot of painting happening.

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,570
There must be a problem with this demo.

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,770
To understand why there's
a lot of painting happening,

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,100
I've opened up the source code for
for the Parallaxing site CSS.

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,520
You can see that there are a lot
of elements that have will-change

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,070
transform applied to them, but
it must not be everything.

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,259
Something Parallaxing has not been
promoted using will-change transform.

12
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,310
So for this quiz I want you to
find the element that should have

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,752
been promoted with will-change.

14
00:00:37,752 --> 00:00:38,990
Use DevTools to fix it and

15
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,300
then to finish this quiz simply type
its ID into this box right here.
