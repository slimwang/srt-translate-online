1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,330
R plus 6 s divided by r plus s is correct. That's some amazing work with

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,430
rationals if you're getting it right. You might have been stumped on how to

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,792
factor one of these. If so, watch me do the first one, and then see if you can

4
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:15,980
finish tackling this problem. To divide by any fraction, including a rational

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,006
expression, we change division to multiplication and multiply by their

6
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:24,490
reciprocal of the first fraction. Now we want to start factoring each piece of

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:30,186
these fractions. I'm going to start with this first one. We know the first two

8
00:00:30,186 --> 00:00:35,602
terms must be r since r times r is r squared. Now we're just trying to find

9
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:39,139
factors of negative 12 that sum to positive 1. Since there's a 1 in front of

10
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:43,794
this r times s. We know that positive 4 and negative 3 multiplied together is

11
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:48,530
negative 12, and sum to give us positive 1, but notice that I need a negative 12

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,310
s squared for my last term. This must mean that I need a variable of s after

13
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,002
each of these numbers. We can quickly check this factoring by multiplying out

14
00:00:56,002 --> 00:01:02,270
the binomials in our head. R times r is r squared, and 4s times negative 3s is

15
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,482
negative 12s squared. This positive 1 r s comes from multiplying these two terms

16
00:01:07,482 --> 00:01:12,304
together, and adding it to the result of multiplying these two together. So we

17
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:18,808
have negative 3 r s plus 4 r s, which is 1 r s. For this first denominator, we

18
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:23,030
want to find factors of negative 20 that sum to negative 1. For our second

19
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,466
fraction we want to find factors of negative 30 that sum to 1. That would be

20
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:32,357
positive 6 and negative 5. And then for our denominator of our second fraction

21
00:01:32,357 --> 00:01:36,704
we want to find factors of negative 3 that sum to negative 2 which are negative

22
00:01:36,704 --> 00:01:39,902
3 and positive 1. Now that everything's factored let's cancel our terms in the

23
00:01:39,902 --> 00:01:45,054
numerator and denominator. There, r minus 3 s divided by r minus 3 s equals 1.

24
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:50,471
And r plus 4 s divided by r plus 4 s also equals 1. The last factor we need to

25
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:56,328
cancel is r minus 5 s. And this leaves us with our final answer, r plus 6 s

26
00:01:56,328 --> 00:01:59,083
divided by r plus 1 s, or just s.
