1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,450
Now let's look for candidate operations.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:08,320
An operation is a computational service provided by an object.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,770
In OOA, candidate operations are suggested by looking for

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,500
verbs, particularly action verbs.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,034
In addition to action verbs there are other kinds of

6
00:00:18,034 --> 00:00:20,150
verbs including linking verbs.

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,617
Which are typically associated with the word is, they're more likely to

8
00:00:24,617 --> 00:00:28,950
be descriptive, hence related to attributes rather than to actions.

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,631
Another category contains the stative verbs,

10
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:37,611
typically descriptions of situations rather than of objects.

11
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:41,910
And they're going to be indicative of relationships among the objects
