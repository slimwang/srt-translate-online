00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,915
It's important to note, that we feel pride when we've accomplished something

2
00:00:02,915 --> 00:00:07,446
really important in our lives. Classic gesture of pride, is when we, raise our

3
00:00:07,446 --> 00:00:12,654
hands and clinch our fist, as we see when, athletes have won a competition. So

4
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:17,746
pride comes in two distinct flavors. Authentic, and self inflated. So an

5
00:00:17,746 --> 00:00:21,078
authentic pride happens when we, accomplish something that's really important

6
00:00:21,078 --> 00:00:26,122
but also very difficult. Like run a marathon. Get an A on a very difficult exam

7
00:00:26,122 --> 00:00:31,098
or do well at work. Self inflated pride however, occurs just because we are

8
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:35,806
superior to other people or feel superior. So for instance, we might drive a

9
00:00:35,806 --> 00:00:41,048
fancy car, have expensive clothes. So there's a superiority that occurs in

10
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:45,239
self-inflated pride that isn't there in authentic pride.
