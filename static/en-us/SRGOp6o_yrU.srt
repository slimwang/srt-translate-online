1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,660
Since we're dividing by x minus 2 over here, and that's the only thing that's

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,668
keeping the cubic polynomial from being by itself. We just need to multiply it

3
00:00:08,668 --> 00:00:12,888
by both sides of the equation by the quantity x minus 2. On the left-hand side,

4
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:17,490
we'll be left with what we're trying to look for. And on the right-hand side,

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,964
we'll have x minus 2 times x squared minus 2x minus 3.
