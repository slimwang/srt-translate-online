00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,563
Lets start with the smimplest polynomial, a monomial. A monomial consists of

2
00:00:04,563 --> 00:00:09,105
only one term, and it could contain the product of numbers and variables. When

3
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:13,259
we see a number next to a variable, we assume that there's a multiplication

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,797
between the two. But, like many things in math, we don't often show it. Here are

5
00:00:17,797 --> 00:00:22,778
lot of examples of monomials. I've rearranged our monomials into certain groups.

6
00:00:22,778 --> 00:00:27,002
Here's a group of four monomials, and in this group, I have a constant

7
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:31,892
coefficient and a variable. The variable is x in three of these, but it doesn't

8
00:00:31,892 --> 00:00:36,257
always have to be. In this one, it's y. These monomials are simply just

9
00:00:36,257 --> 00:00:41,175
constants. They don't even contain variables. This monomial is negative and it

10
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:45,947
contains variables with exponents. Monomials can be positive or negative, like

11
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:50,508
in the first group. And finally, this last group shows an example where we have

12
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:55,464
a constant coefficient and multiple variables multiplied together. Each of these

13
00:00:55,464 --> 00:00:57,120
is an example of a monomial.
