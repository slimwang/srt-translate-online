00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,370
Sunshine currently looks like this, but

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,550
it doesn't show most of the fun
information about the weather.

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,129
Our final version of Sunshine shows you
detailed information about a day of

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,330
weather when you click
an item in the list.

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,500
But it will contain all sorts
of great weather e-details,

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,370
things that weather nerds love
such as barometric pressure and

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,829
that navigators love such as
wind speed and direction.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,500
At the end of the lesson,
Sunshine will look like this.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,750
It might not look that impressive but in
it will be telling Android how to move

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,280
between different activities in our app
and also how to pass data between them.
