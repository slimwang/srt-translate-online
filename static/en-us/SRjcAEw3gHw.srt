00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,379
We've seen a couple of cases of direct variation, so let's look at inverse

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,816
variation. Earlier we determined that the speed of a vehicle and the driving

3
00:00:08,816 --> 00:00:13,213
time were inversely related. If we drive really fast, then we don't need as much

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:17,630
time to get to our final destination. If a car takes 20 minutes to travel some

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:22,280
distance at 45 miles per hour, how long would it take that same car to travel

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,137
the same exact distance driving at 60 miles per hour? We want to be very careful

7
00:00:27,137 --> 00:00:33,194
though. We don't want to use this proportion. This is for direct variation. This

8
00:00:33,194 --> 00:00:37,738
proportion would say that if we drive faster, then it would take longer to get

9
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,747
somewhere. But we know this is not true. We know if we drive faster, then our

10
00:00:42,747 --> 00:00:48,640
time spent driving decreases. So instead of doing this, we can flip this second

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,740
fraction over. If we flip the second fraction over, we can see that our speed

12
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,546
now would be decreasing. If we drive slower, then it should take longer amount

13
00:00:58,546 --> 00:01:03,585
of time to get there. This also fits with our notion of speed and time. If speed

14
00:01:03,585 --> 00:01:09,362
increases, time decreases. Likewise if speed decreases, as in this case, then we

15
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:14,190
know that we should expect to drive longer. Time increases. For inverse

16
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,877
variation, we always want to put the other quantity in the opposite position.

17
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:23,380
We'll need to flip the fraction that varies inversely. So what do you think, how

18
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,353
long would it take us to drive?
