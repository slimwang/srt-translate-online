00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,350
Remember back in lesson two we
learned that a ListView is just

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,960
one type of an AdapterView.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,020
Another type of AdapterView
that we looked at was GridView.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,740
So, here we are looking at
the ListView documentation and

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,190
in it we see the class hierarchy
diagram for the ListView.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,110
Remember that a tree diagram shows what
class inherits from another class.

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,850
And at each level
the code was extended and

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,770
then extra code was
added via a subclass.

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,410
Now from this diagram we can
verify that the ListView

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,012
is a subclass of the AdapterView class.

11
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:31,180
An AdaptorView has fields and
methods for

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,712
a view group whose children
are populated from an adapter and

13
00:00:33,712 --> 00:00:38,650
the ListView can inherit States and
methods from this AdapterView class and

14
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:43,300
then add on its own code to customize
it for the specific list case.

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,220
Let's take a look more closely at
the set on item click Listener method.

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,910
So, this method is actually defined
in the AdapterView superclass.

17
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,600
So, let's click into it, and
notice when we dive deeper into it

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,230
we jump into the AdapterView
reference page.

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,920
So, to reiterate the set
OnItemClickListener was

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,020
defined in the AdapterView class.

21
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,580
Now the AdapterView defines the input of
this method to be an OnItemClickListener

22
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,860
object, which is defined
within the AdapterView class.

23
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,320
So, let's click into that.

24
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,650
So, this OnitemClickListener object is
defined within the AdapterView class and

25
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:21,019
that's why it's referred to as
AdapterView.OnItemClickListerner.
