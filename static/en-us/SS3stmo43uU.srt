1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,273
So, from the last problem, we were able to figure out that x equals 3. But what

2
00:00:05,273 --> 00:00:10,500
if the exponent is not known? What if we had this equation? This second

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,350
equation is called an exponential equation. It's called that since the exponent

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:20,773
is the variable, and it's unknown. But we can apply similar reasoning. Let's

5
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:25,904
take 27 and write it with a base of 3. We can rewrite 27 as 3 to the third

6
00:00:25,904 --> 00:00:31,416
power. And since these two bases are the same. We know the exponents must be

7
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:36,746
equal in order for the two numbers to be the same. So here we know that this x

8
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:43,380
must equal this exponent. X must equal 3. In general, whenever we have x to the

9
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,156
a, equal x to the b, we know that the exponents a and b must be equal, since

10
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:53,151
their bases are equal. This works in general so long as x, which is the base,

11
00:00:53,151 --> 00:00:57,900
is not equal to 0 or 1. So for an equation like this, what do you think x

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,791
equals? Write it here.
