1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Congratulations. You made it through homework assignment number 1.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You learned about Monte Carlo robot localization

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
with a technique that I often call histogram filters.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You've implemented it successfully and learned a lot about statistics.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is all just a single class. Congratulations. That's really awesome.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now, next week we talk about common filters and tracking other cards in traffic,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and you're going to implement our common filter, so I'll see you in the next class.
