00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,490
Now that we have a database
that supports creating users,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,310
let's write up some codes
to interact with it.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,040
For this project, I want to point out
that our back end code will look up

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,550
a user based on his or her email
address associated with their login.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,240
So logging in with a Google account and
a Facebook account tied to

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,100
the same email address will provide
the same level of authorization.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,600
To get started,
open up your project.pi file and

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,370
be sure to import the user
model that we just created.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,910
I want to walk you through three methods
you should add to your project.pi file

10
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,230
that may help you deal with
getting user information.

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,880
The first is createUser.

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,049
It takes in a login_session as input and

13
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,500
creates a new user in our database,
extracting all of the fields necessary

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,800
to populate it with the information
gathered from the login_session.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,890
It then returns the user
ID of the new user created.

16
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,830
The next one is getUserInfo.

17
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,960
If a user ID is passed into this method,

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,660
it simply returns the user object
associated with this ID number.

19
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,560
And, finally, is getUserID, which will
take an email address and return an ID

20
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,040
number if that email address belongs
to a user stored in our database.

21
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,660
If not, it returns none.

22
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,370
In your code,
you should also add the user ID field

23
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,340
when you create a new restaurant or
menu item, like so.

24
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,220
In the instructor notes,

25
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,340
you'll find a version of project.pi
that contains these new code additions.
