00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,689
Let's consider now a similar question,
but now we're using parametric models,

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,854
a polynomial model of degree d.

3
00:00:08,854 --> 00:00:13,580
Real quick, here's what we mean
when we say polynomial of degree d.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,832
So here's what our
polynomial model looks like,

5
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:23,415
it's m1 times x, m2 times x squared,
m3 times x cubed plus b.

6
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:28,964
This is a third order polynomial,
or a polynomial of degree d so

7
00:00:28,964 --> 00:00:33,152
I want you to consider d=1, d=2, d=3 and

8
00:00:33,152 --> 00:00:39,480
I want you to select which model
over here goes with that degree.

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,130
Then I want you to
consider this question.

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,160
True or false, as we increase d
we are more likely to overfit.
