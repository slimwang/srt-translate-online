Awesome job everyone.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,080
You made it through the to do list.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,560
That was kind of a whirlwind of new
technologies but you'll be rewarded for

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,010
your effort once you get Mimi 1.0 up and
running.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,940
In implementing each
of these technologies,

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,400
you will undoubtedly get
stucks at some point.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,930
Pretty much everyone does,
so don't sweat it.

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,970
Just be sure to reach out
to your classmates and

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,180
Udecy team members for help.

10
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,980
Also, be sure to submit your project to
get feedback from our professional code

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,580
reviewers.
