1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,530
So bc was an example of
a line oriented program, but

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,400
not every program we use in
the terminal works this way.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,530
You've already seen one
program that doesn't.

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,920
The man program, for reading the manual
takes up a full terminal screen.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,500
It's actually use another program called
less that knows how to display text

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,190
one page at a time.

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,280
So when you press Q to stop
looking at a manual page.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,100
You're actually using a command
that less understands.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,700
And you can use less to display any
file you like not just man pages.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,460
Let's try using less
on a long text file.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,305
Remember to use tab completion when
entering a long filename like this one.

12
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:39,485
Scrolling up and down with arrow keys
works the same way as it did before, and

13
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:43,645
man you can also scroll down a page
at a time by using the D key or

14
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:45,165
by hitting the Space Bar.

15
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:48,104
You can scroll up one page
at a time wit a U key.

16
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:50,072
If you want to skip to very
last line of the file,

17
00:00:50,072 --> 00:00:52,730
you can use the right angle bracket for
that.

18
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,911
To get back up to the first line
use the left angle bracket.

19
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:58,935
You can go to a particular line
by typing its line number and

20
00:00:58,935 --> 00:01:00,590
hitting Enter.

21
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,650
This is particularly useful when working
with source code where you know the line

22
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,590
numbers of important lines.

23
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,250
It's also useful when you decide to
quickly move to the middle of a file.

24
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,296
Less also has built-in search.

25
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:14,580
Type slash and then the string
you'd like to search for.

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,540
Press Enter or
return to execute the search.

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,930
You can find the next occurrence
of the search term by pressing n.

28
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,160
To go back to the previous occurrence,
use capital N.

29
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,180
Search terms are case sensitive.

30
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,950
Searching for otter with a lower case o,
won't find any capital O otters.

31
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,550
If you're familiar with regular
expressions you can use them here,

32
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,870
unless the search is actually looking
for lines that match your pattern.

33
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,800
If you don't know regular expressions,
you can still use lesson search

34
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,420
capability, but you should be
careful and only search for

35
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,900
patterns consisting of numbers and
letters.

36
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,600
The regular expression library will
interpret other characters in ways you

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,310
might not expect.
