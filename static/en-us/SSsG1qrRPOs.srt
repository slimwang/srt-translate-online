00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,340
Now that we have a better understanding, of, the benefits of separating the

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,280
data and control plane, let's now have a look, at the many different options for

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,260
SDN controllers. There are a number of different SDN controllers that

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,534
exist, including NOX, Ryu, Floodlight, Pyretic,

5
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:26,520
Frenetic, Procera, Route Flow, Trema, and the list goes on.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,590
In this lesson, we will explore the merits of these three

7
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,950
controllers. And when we get to the lesson on Programming SDN,

8
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,010
we will take a close look at Frenetic and Pyretic. Let's

9
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,380
now jump in and take a look at these three controllers.
