00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,030
To illustrate the idea of
a polynomial reduction,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,210
we're going to reduce the problem of
finding an independent set in the graph,

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,500
to that of finding a vertex cover.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,230
In the next lesson, we're going to
argue that if P is not equal to NP,

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,710
then independent set is not in P,
so vertex cover can't be either.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,360
But that's getting ahead of ourselves.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,410
First, for the benefit of those not all
ready familiar with these problems,

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,330
we will state them briefly.

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,770
First will consider the independent set
problem and see how it is equivalent to

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,905
the clique problem that we talked
about when we introduced the class NP.

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,500
Given a graph, a subset of
the vertices is an independent set

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,530
if there are no edges between
the vertices in the set S.

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,172
For example, these two vertices here
do not form an independent set because

14
00:00:44,172 --> 00:00:46,140
there's an edge between them.

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,320
However, these three vertices
do form an independent set

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,580
because there are no edges between them.

17
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,200
Clearly each individual vertex
forms an independent set

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,800
since there isn't another vertex in
the set for it to have an edge with.

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,830
And the more vertices we add, the harder
it is to find new ones to add.

20
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,640
So, finding a maximum independent
set is the interesting question.

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,960
Or, phrased as a decision problem,

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,450
the question becomes given a graph g,
and an integer k, at most,

23
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,440
the number of vertices, does g
have an independent set of size k?

24
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,260
Note that this problem is in NP.

25
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,820
Given a subset of the vertices, it's
easy to count them to make sure that

26
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,860
there are indeed k, and check that
there are no edits between them.

27
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,790
This problem is so

28
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,640
close to the clique problem that
the two are usually considered as one.

29
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,890
The set is independent in a graph if and

30
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,100
only if there's a clique
in the complement graph.

31
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,770
By the complement graph,
I mean the one where there is no edge

32
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,440
if there was an edge between two
vertices in the original, and

33
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,130
there is an edge if there
wasn't one in the original.

34
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,420
Not having any edges between a set
of vertices in the original graph is

35
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,700
the same as having all the edges among
the vertices in the complement graph.
