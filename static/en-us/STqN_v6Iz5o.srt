00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,500
A common term for the behavior
you just saw is that plus equals

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,050
operates in place while plus does not.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:07,950
That is,

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,580
plus equals is storing all the new
values in the same places the original

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,780
values were stored rather than
creating a new array to store them in.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,110
Operations that are not in place
can be a lot easier to think about.

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,240
Like you just saw,
when you do in-place operations,

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,990
variables can be modified even when it
doesn't look like they will change,

9
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,420
such as the variable b
in the previous example.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,500
In this course we'll mostly be using
operations that are not in-place.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,010
I prefer to use just plus for
vectorized addition, not plus equals.

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,710
Here's another place where
this concept comes up.

13
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,460
Read through this code snippet, and

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,620
decide what you think
the output will be.

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,750
Again, if you're not sure, either
try it out, or take your best guess.
