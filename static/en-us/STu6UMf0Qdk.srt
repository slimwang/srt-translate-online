00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,510
Let's now talk a little bit about web content

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,140
distribution networks or CDNs. We'll first talk about what

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,820
a CDN is and why a content provider might

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,280
want to use one. We'll then talk about how service

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,090
selection works in CDNs and how clients get redirected

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,690
to the right server. So first of all, what is

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,220
a content distribution network? It's an overlay network of

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,690
web caches that's designed to deliver content to a client

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,150
from the optimal location. Now, in many

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,180
cases, optimal means geographically closest but, sometimes,

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,680
optimal is not the geographically closest cache

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,100
and we'll see some examples of when that's

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,060
the case. CDNs are made of distinct

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,510
geographically disparate groups of servers, where each group

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,750
can serve all the content on the CDN. These CDNs can often be quite extensive.

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,560
Here is a global map depicting the

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,490
deployment of the Google cache servers, around

18
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,840
the world. As mapped in a recent

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,890
project, by researchers at the University of Southern

20
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,380
California. As you can see, these Web caches can be quite extensive and in many

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,610
cases there's a concerted effort to place

22
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,600
caches as close as possible to users. Some

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,480
CDNs are owned by content providers such as Google and others are owned and

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,600
operated by networks such as Level 3, Limelight and AT&T. Still others such

25
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:35,890
as Akami operate independently. Non network CDNs, such as Akami and Google, can

26
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,340
typically place servers in other autonomous systems

27
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,645
or ISPs. The number of cache nodes

28
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:46,680
ind a large content distribution network can vary. For example, in the Google

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,120
Network, the USC researchers found that there

30
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,450
were about 30,000 unique front-end cache nodes.

31
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,990
As of about two years ago, the Akamai Edge platform reported about 85,000

32
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,170
unique caching servers, in nearly 1,000 unique

33
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,780
networks around the world, in 72 countries.
