1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,880
Let's start with this one, finishing order in a race. The first person crosses

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,910
the finish line so he or she is number one. The second person might cross 30

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:16,219
seconds later, let's say. That person is number two. The third person might

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:21,530
cross immediately after the second person. But it doesn't matter that person is

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:26,340
still number three. It doesn't matter the spacing in-between when they finish

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,930
the race. They'll still be assigned that rank. Therefore there are not equal

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:36,315
intervals between the rankings and their is no absolute zero because their

8
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:41,430
can't be a zeroth ranking. Let's go to percentage correct on a test. If one

9
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:49,380
student gets a 100%, another gets 90%, another student gets 87%. Then their

10
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,490
definitely be some kind of rank. The person that got a 100% scored first place

11
00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:00,425
in the class. But there are also equal intervals. A person who scored 100%,

12
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:06,730
scored one percentage point more than a person who scored 99%, and so on. Their

13
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:12,060
score on the test makes sense in relation to each other. We know how much

14
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,820
better one students did than another. Unlike finishing order in a race, we just

15
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,380
know the ranking but we don't know how much faster one runner finished the race

16
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,450
than another. And there's also an absolute zero. A student can score 0% and get

17
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,240
nothing right. But here she can't score any lower than that. However

18
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,310
temperature and degree Celsius can be zero and it can be lower. Zero is kind of

19
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:45,110
an arbitrary value that we've assigned to a particular temperature. But just

20
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,310
like percentage correct on a test, there are equal intervals between the

21
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:56,020
values. The value by itself makes sense in relation another value in this data

22
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,860
set. We call this type of data with just ranks ordinal data. There's a clear

23
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,340
order to the data but the distance between the first and the second is not

24
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,509
necessarily the same as between the second and the third. Or the third and the

25
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:15,380
fourth, etcetera. Temperature and degrees Celsius is an example of interval

26
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,780
data. The spacing between the values are equal but there is no real zero. The

27
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,920
kind of data that has ranks with equal intervals and an absolute zero is called

28
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,250
ratio data.
