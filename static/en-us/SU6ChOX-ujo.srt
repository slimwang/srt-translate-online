00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Welcome back to Introduction to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,556
I'm Aaron Bobick still by the way.

3
00:00:04,556 --> 00:00:08,538
I normally when I introduce something I'd say, who I am, but I guess you know.

4
00:00:08,538 --> 00:00:09,653
Okay.

5
00:00:09,653 --> 00:00:13,641
So last time we talked about projective geometry and sort of this relationship

6
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:17,571
between lines, points and planes and, and using sort of the projective relation

7
00:00:17,571 --> 00:00:20,960
and homogenous coordinates as an easy way to describe these things.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,260
Today, we'll use this a little bit to talk about the relation between two

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,220
calibrated cameras.

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,298
Next time, it will be uncalibrated.

11
00:00:27,298 --> 00:00:29,683
Just ta contextualize it again a little bit,

12
00:00:29,683 --> 00:00:33,277
we have these projective transforms that are these matrices.

13
00:00:33,277 --> 00:00:36,461
These are 3D matri, three by three matrices that operate in

14
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:40,498
two-dimensions that can transform from an image in a variety of ways.

15
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:43,157
For 3D we talked about it being four by four.

16
00:00:43,157 --> 00:00:47,695
We also talked about transformation that are called Homographies that would map

17
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:48,648
between planes.

18
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:51,633
This is going to become very important not in this lesson, but the next one.

19
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:55,253
Because we're, we're going to be talking about recovering homographies that map

20
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:56,310
between image planes.

21
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,903
We also introduced projective lines and

22
00:00:58,903 --> 00:01:04,388
we talked about that a line in an image plane was just the intersection of an,

23
00:01:04,388 --> 00:01:08,372
the image plane and a plane through the center of projection.

24
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:12,814
That plane would be defined by a normal l and that's why both a line and

25
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:17,348
a point are 3-vectors in this homogeneous or, or projected space.

26
00:01:17,348 --> 00:01:21,422
And we showed some really cool things, we showed how the equation of

27
00:01:21,422 --> 00:01:26,148
a line is represented by the normal components in this projective space.

28
00:01:26,148 --> 00:01:29,617
And then a little bit of some cool operations that if I gave you two points,

29
00:01:29,617 --> 00:01:31,668
defined in terms of projective coordinates,

30
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:34,946
you could find the line that connected them by doing the cross-product.

31
00:01:34,946 --> 00:01:36,657
Likewise, if I gave you two lines,

32
00:01:36,657 --> 00:01:40,207
you could find the point of intersection by doing their cross-product.

33
00:01:40,207 --> 00:01:43,620
And these are some tools that we're going to make use of going forward.
