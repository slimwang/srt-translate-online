1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,750
So, to build an app like this one for
location services and

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,820
many of the other services that you'll
be encountering in this course,

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,780
you're going to do the following steps.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,610
First of all, the easiest way to
get started is to create a new

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,190
app using a Blank Activity
in Android Studio.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,790
Once you've done this,

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,830
you'll edit the build.gradle
to add the services libraries.

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,020
You'll using something like this,
but the version number may change.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,420
Then, you'll edit AndroidManifest.xml,
to tell your application that you're

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,750
using these services libraries, and the
particular version that you're using.

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,490
When you put this value,
integer Google Play services version.

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,830
When you do a gradle sync, the correct
version number will be put in for you.

13
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,050
So it's good just to use this string.

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,320
And then finally,
in AndroidManifest.xml you're

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,300
probably going to be adding
a bunch of permissions as well.

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,410
In this case I was doing location so

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,850
you see I set users permission for
access_fine_location.

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,097
Depending on the activity or depending
on the type of application that you're

19
00:00:57,097 --> 00:00:59,769
building, you'll be putting
different permissions in here.
