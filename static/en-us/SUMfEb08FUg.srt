1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,792
m 1 is just equal to negative m 2. These slopes are the same magnitude, but

2
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:07,719
opposite signs. This makes sense, intuitively, in terms of how our graph is

3
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:11,850
shaped. The slope right here, is as steep as the slope right here, just pointing

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,546
the other direction. This is going to be true of any two points, that are

5
00:00:15,546 --> 00:00:19,988
directly opposite one another, across that line of symmetry we drew before. This

6
00:00:19,988 --> 00:00:24,045
is a way then of quantifying that symmetry of the graph. You can imagine also

7
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:28,141
that if we flipped one side of the graph over that line of symmetry to the other

8
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:30,050
side it would map directly onto it.
