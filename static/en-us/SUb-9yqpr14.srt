00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,744
One of the objectives of this lesson is to give you some tools to

2
00:00:03,744 --> 00:00:08,233
think carefully about dealing with complexed, that is the management of these

3
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:13,210
levels of abstraction. So to do that, I am going to introduce notation. Okay,

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:18,620
this notation is taken from first OR logic. To state property too precisely,

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,280
we are going to need a little of that notation. And throughout the rest of

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,810
this lesson, we are also going to use the term abstract and

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:32,910
concrete to refer to the upper and lower levels of a refinement. First off,

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,880
we are going to talk about the abstract operations and we are going to use P1,

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,940
P2 and so on up to Pn and Pi we'll use to

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:46,710
indicate a typical abstract operation. We're going to have abstract states.

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,010
The set of abstract states is the capital letter S and

12
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,980
a typical abstract, typical element of the abstract state is the letter s.

13
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,260
And we'll also put an apostrophe after the s if what we're talking about

14
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,790
is the abstract state after an operation. We have invariants, we use inv

15
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:12,110
to indicate invariants and invA will stand for abstract invariants and

16
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,975
invC will correspond to the concrete invariants. We have pre-conditions and

17
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:20,830
post-conditions and we'll just append the word pre and

18
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:27,070
post to our Pi's to indicate. Whether it's a pre condition or a post condition,

19
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,490
and those pre and post conditions can have states associated with them and

20
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:37,300
arguments. Finally we'll use symbols like the ampersand to indicate and,

21
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:42,940
and the rightward facing arrow to indicate implies.
