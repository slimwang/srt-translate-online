If you look around the flickr
documentation you'll see there's a bunch

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,140
of different methods.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,360
And looking around the documentation
to see what methods are available is

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,760
actually a really good practice.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,060
This is something that developers do all
the time once they've picked an API.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,710
You know once you know
that the API has for

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,250
instance image information you
want to know how can I access it.

8
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,120
So as an exercise I'm going to give
you a couple different things that you

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,970
might want to do with the flickr API and

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,910
then I want you to tell me
which method I should use.

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,940
So which method should I use if I want
to get a list of photos for a gallery?

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,550
What if I want to get a list of public
photos for the given user, how about

13
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,420
the number of views comments and
favorites on a photo for a given date?

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,470
And finally, to get the URL for
a user's photos?

15
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,470
For each of these questions,

16
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,280
I want you to write the name of
the method in the text box next to it.
