00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,678
I'd like for you to create a scale for
all the circles on the Gapminder plot,

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:06,820
and save this scale into
a variable called "r".

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,990
I've included some information about
the populations for the minimum and

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,790
maximum values.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,555
So your domain needs to map from
the minimum value of 52070,

6
00:00:17,555 --> 00:00:21,575
which is the population
of the Marshall Islands,

7
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:25,265
to 1.38 billion,
which is the population in China.

8
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:30,875
You want to map these domain values to
a range value between 10 pixels and

9
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:31,925
50 pixels.

10
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:32,424
Good luck.
