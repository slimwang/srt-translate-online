1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,880
So the first question to ask is, well, why multiple views?

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,280
Obviously, structure and

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,090
depth are fundamentally inherently ambiguous from a single view.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,620
Remember, we're projecting from 3D to 2D?

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,580
When we do that, we lose information.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,328
So here's an example of a man pushing the Leaning Tower of Pisa over to make it

7
00:00:19,328 --> 00:00:20,540
lean even further.

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,256
And either he's very large, the building's very small, or

9
00:00:24,256 --> 00:00:27,628
there's an ambiguity when you project from 3D to 2D.

10
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,624
Or how about, so those of us who grew up in the States who were a fan of,

11
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:32,670
It's a Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,700
So that might be a picture that looks like this.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,620
Which would be really a great pumpkin.

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,430
But of course, what's really going on here is that the location of the camera

15
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,930
makes it such that this picture just appears like the pumpkin is very large.

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,150
And what's fundamental problem?

17
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,910
Well, the fundamental problem comes for, from perspective projection.

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,830
Here we have an optical center.

19
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,410
All right.

20
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:59,720
And we have several points such as P1 and P2 projecting along the same ray.

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,252
And of course, because they project along the same ray,

22
00:01:03,252 --> 00:01:06,133
they land in the same spot P1 prime P2 prime.

23
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,702
And so that's where the ambiguity comes from.

24
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:12,474
And the question is how to figure out where P1 and P2 really are.

25
00:01:12,474 --> 00:01:15,165
And the trick, of course, is going to be the look at a different camera.
