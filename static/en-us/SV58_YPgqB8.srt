00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,512
One solution is to replace the last line of the fragment shader with this line

2
00:00:03,512 --> 00:00:07,804
of code. The order of the values is red, green and blue. An alternate solution

3
00:00:07,804 --> 00:00:10,748
is to set each of these individually, either solution is fine, you could even

4
00:00:10,748 --> 00:00:13,554
use x, y, z, w for the coordinate names, the shading language interpreter

5
00:00:13,554 --> 00:00:18,830
doesn't care. I wanted to show this colorful multivariable way of debugging.

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,260
And it's sometimes handy for seeing correlations between parameters. In

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,410
practice though, it's usually clear to copy just a single value to all three

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,000
color channels.
