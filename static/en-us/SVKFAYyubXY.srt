1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,200
All right,
time to look back at our checklist.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,640
Convert a video into a GIF and
display the GIF.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,530
Well, here's the video we recorded and
there it is as a GIF.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,400
So we can check that one off.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,130
What's next?
Add a caption.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,640
What will we need to
do to add a caption?

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,370
Up until now, we've had no GIF model.

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,090
To have an object to save the caption
to, we'll need to rewrite the Gif class.

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,740
We'll also need to implement the caption
text field in the Gif Editor and

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,689
that will require some code
to adjust the keyboard.

11
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,790
Then we'll need to take the caption
that the user inputs and

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,340
add it to every image that
makes up our animated GIF.

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,200
Super!

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,940
Let's get to it.
