1
00:00:00,014 --> 00:00:05,050
When a service worker is registered,
it's limited to the scope provided

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,160
meaning that it will only handle
requests within its scope.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,590
If we register a service
worker at /folder/sw.js,

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,740
the service worker would
only see fetch event for

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,930
pages who's URL starts
with folder/something.

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,430
You'll notice in this case,

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,540
the service worker is registered
at the root of the domain.

8
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,930
This means, the service worker
scope will be the entire origin.

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:34,760
In other words,

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,170
the service worker will receive fetch
event for everything on this domain.
