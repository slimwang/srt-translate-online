The range of x for this first inequality goes from negative infinity to positive

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,616
infinity. Remember, of course, that we need the round parentheses, not including

3
00:00:08,616 --> 00:00:12,783
the infinities. The second goes from negative 2 including negative 2 up to

4
00:00:12,783 --> 00:00:17,387
infinity. The third starting at negative 2, including it, up to 6, not including

5
00:00:17,387 --> 00:00:23,283
it. And the last one starting at negative 6 but not including it and up through
