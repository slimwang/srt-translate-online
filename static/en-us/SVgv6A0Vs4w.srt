1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Before looking at how that works, I want to demonstrate

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
what happens when we connect using TLS in the browser.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Different browsers deal with TLS in different ways.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If we connect to https://www.google.com that's using SSL to connect,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
we can see in the address bar it's indicating that it's a secured connection.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If we click on that, we can see more information about that.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We are connected to the site google.com, unknown who it's run by,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and it is verified by a certificate provided by Thawte Consulting Ltd,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and we can click on this to get more information about that key.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This has the information about the certificate, and we can click on the certificate to see what it was.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It says our communication between the sites is now being encrypted.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
As the result of the Handshake Protocol, the client and the server have agreed on the key,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and now all the messages between our client and the server are encrypted using that key.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If we look at the certificate, we'll see more information

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
about how that was established, and we have an SSL server certificate.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It indicates who it was issued to, so it was issued to www.google.com.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That matches the name of the site we connected to,

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and it explains who issued the certificate, and it has fingerprints for the certificate.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We can also see that it has an expiration date.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Certificates don't last forever. That's an important property.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If the certificate lasted forever, we'd have to have a very strong encryption on it.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
By making it expire, the key license needed for the certificate

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
can be predicted based on expected computing power until the expiration time.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We can see more if we look in the details.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is where we get into the real issue of how the certificates work--

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
that there is a chain of authorities that validate the certificate.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We'll talk about that more soon and then look at this again.
