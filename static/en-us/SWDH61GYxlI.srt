1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,337
The greatest common factor for these two numbers would be 24. Excellent work if

2
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:10,096
you got this one correct. If we expand the prime factors of 216 and the prime

3
00:00:10,096 --> 00:00:14,727
factors of 192, we can see that they share three, two's and one, three. The

4
00:00:14,727 --> 00:00:19,847
greatest common factor is the product of the lowest power of each factor that

5
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:24,750
appears in each term. So two to the third is the lowest power of the basic two

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,732
that appears in both terms. And three to the one is also the lowest power that

7
00:00:29,732 --> 00:00:34,449
appears for the base of three in each term. We want to simplify our result so

8
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:37,203
two cubed is eight and eight times three is 24.
