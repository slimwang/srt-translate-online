1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now the task is to actually write a Python function

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
to compute the acceleration that we have derived before.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The mass of the earth and the mass of the moon

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and the gravitational constant are already given in that code.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The function that you should write gets the position of the spaceship as 2-dimensional vectors

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and should return a 2-dimensional vector that describes the acceleration of the spaceship.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There is one nice function of the NumPy package that you will be needing,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
namely, the norm function which computes the length of a vector.
