00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,924
Now when Skinner was first studying rats in his Skinner box, he actually made

2
00:00:03,924 --> 00:00:08,552
his own food pallets, and that was quite tedious. So he wondered what would

3
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:11,880
happen if, instead of reinforcing every level press, he actually spaced out

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,158
some of those reinforcers. And this is how he discovered an entire field of

5
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:20,970
study, of schedules of reinforcement. There are many different schedules, but

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,020
the two we'll just discuss briefly here are ratio schedules and interval

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,041
schedules. We have a ratio schedule and I could have a fixed ratio of five,

8
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:34,228
which means every fifth response is reinforced. We also have interval

9
00:00:34,228 --> 00:00:38,072
schedules. Those are time schedules, so I could have a fixed interval of 30

10
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:43,384
seconds. That would mean that the first response that occurred after 30 seconds

11
00:00:43,384 --> 00:00:49,008
was reinforced. Skinner famously compared rats in his Skinner box to humans by

12
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:54,668
looking at humans in casinos. On a variable schedule, reinforcement occurs on a

13
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:58,562
variable schedule, meaning perhaps after every ten responses, after every 20

14
00:00:58,562 --> 00:01:04,532
responses. This type of schedule engenders a lot of behavior. You can just go

15
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:09,104
to Las Vegas and watch people at the slot machines pulling the levers. They're

16
00:01:09,104 --> 00:01:13,646
no different than rats pressing levers in their Skinner boxes. Skinner studied

17
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:18,409
rats in Skinner boxes. The behavior first has to occur before it can be

18
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:23,694
reinforced. We can use shaping, which is reinforcing successive approximations

19
00:01:23,694 --> 00:01:28,093
to the target behavior. And we can generate different types of behavior through

20
00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:32,840
schedules of reinforcement. Be sure to read the pdf in the instructor's notes

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,451
on schedules of reinforcement. We're going to talk more about operant

22
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:41,751
conditioning, however, this time with another animal, sea lions.
