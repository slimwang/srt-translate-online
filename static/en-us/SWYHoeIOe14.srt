Athena's $300 is going to be multiplied by 1 plus the interest rate written as

2
00:00:05,273 --> 00:00:11,767
a decimal, so 0.05. And that multiplying is going to happen four times, since

3
00:00:11,767 --> 00:00:17,632
interest will be compounded four times in four years. We can, of course, use

4
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:25,559
our wonderful calculator to multiply this out. 1 plus 0.05 is just 1.05. And

5
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:35,910
this raised to the 4th power is this quantity. We want to multiply that by 300.

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:42,707
That gives us 364.651875. Rounding to cents, that gives us $364.65.
