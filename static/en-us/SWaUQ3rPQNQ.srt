00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,150
In procedural code, systematic variation is often dealt with

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,740
via case statements or else-if cascades. In object-oriented code,

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,910
this approach is considered a bad smell. Instead, you should use parallel,

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:18,790
factored subclasses with the choice specific code embodied in a subclass method.

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,940
This approach is called the single choice principle.
