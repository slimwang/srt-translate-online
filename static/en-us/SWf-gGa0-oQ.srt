00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,059
In deciding among the possibilities the tradeoff between locality and

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,240
complexity needs to be considered. In the centralized choice,

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,890
there's a single place that handles all invariants, but that implementation of

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,360
that place can be quite complex. On the other hand, complete distribution.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,620
While allowing each invariant to be handled in a simple way, can lead to

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,170
solutions that are hard to debug. Because of the many moving parts involved.
