00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,770
Hi, welcome.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,700
I'll be guiding you through
the coding lessons in this class.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,230
The first thing you'll do is deploy a
simple app engine application that uses

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,350
endpoints.

5
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,720
You'll learn how to define
endpoint functions.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,632
You'll learn how to call an endpoint
function from a webpage using

7
00:00:14,632 --> 00:00:16,091
the JavaScript client library.

8
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:19,520
You'll also learn how to use the APIs
Explorer, which is a cool tool for

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,865
exploring publicly
available Google APIs, and

10
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:24,680
which also lets you test out
your own application's API.

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,470
The main coding project
that you'll be building in

12
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,260
this course is an application
called Conference Central.

13
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,360
It let's users schedule conferences and
also register to attend conferences.

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,320
You'll be focusing on implementing
the backend functions.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,860
Just like on a cooking show
where some of the cakes

16
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,120
are already baked ahead of time,
we've written some of the code for you,

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,870
so that you can get straight to work
implementing the more interesting bits.

18
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,660
You'll start out by downloading
a skeleton version of the conference

19
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,140
central application.

20
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,110
Then, you can keep working on it,
from lesson to lesson.

21
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,960
But, at any point, if you don't complete
the exercises in a lesson, don't worry.

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,510
We provide new starting code for
each lesson.

23
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,530
Okay, let's go write
some endpoint functions.
