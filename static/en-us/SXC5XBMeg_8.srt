1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,589
What did you come up with, David?

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:04,700
>> So I started at the root,
is the origin North of 5N?

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,030
It certainly is.

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,240
Is the origin East of 5E?

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,330
No, it's not.

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,630
And is the origin East of 3E?

7
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,613
No, it's still not.

8
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:16,096
So I said Y would go
down here alongside A.

9
00:00:16,096 --> 00:00:17,850
That's good, David, but of course,

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,200
we must find a way of
discriminating between A and Y.
