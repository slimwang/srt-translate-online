00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,708
Okay, here's a simple CUDA program that'll illustrate these ideas.

2
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:06,147
So we're going to launch 16 blocks,

3
00:00:06,147 --> 00:00:08,539
and each one's going to have a single thread running,

4
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:12,685
and it's going to run a trivial kernel that just prints, "Hello world! I'm a thread in block."

5
00:00:12,685 --> 00:00:16,052
And then in the main, we're going to do nothing more than launch that kernel.

6
00:00:16,052 --> 00:00:18,665
You need this call cudaDeviceSynchronize to make sure

7
00:00:18,665 --> 00:00:23,109
that these print f's flush and then we'll print, "That's all."

8
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:25,228
So before we run this, here's a quick quiz.

9
00:00:25,228 --> 00:00:29,199
How many different outputs do you think different runs of this program can produce?

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,031
Is it 1?

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,570
16 possible different outputs?

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,039
2 to the 16th possible different outputs?

13
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:39,184
Or 21 trillion possible outputs?
