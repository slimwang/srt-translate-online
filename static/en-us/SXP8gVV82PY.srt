1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,210
A route hijack is an attack on origin

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,000
authentication because in a, in a route hijack,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,660
the AS that is advertising the prefix is

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,490
actually not the rightful owner of that prefix. In

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,720
addition to control plan security, we also have

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,600
to worry about data plan security or determining

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,270
whether data is traveling to the intended locations.

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,990
In general, it can be extremely hard to verify

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,430
that packets or traffic is traveling

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,480
along the intended route to the destination.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,030
Or that it, in fact, even reaches the intended destination in the first place.

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,460
Guaranteeing that traffic actually traverses the advertised

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,860
route remains an important open problem in

14
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,960
internet security. So how do these attacks on routing happen in the first place?
