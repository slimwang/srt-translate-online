1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,733
Let's look at the answer for
our hit time quiz.

2
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:08,980
In a well-designed cache, hit time is
significantly lower than miss time.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,750
Miss time includes the hit time and
the miss penalty.

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,190
Typically, we want the hit
time to be very small and

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,540
that means that the miss time should
not be anywhere close to the hit time.

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,750
And if there is any miss penalty,

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,510
miss time will be larger
than hit time anyway.

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,860
So this should be true for every cache,
even if you didn't design it very well.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,500
Hit time is larger than the miss
penalty, we definitely don't want that.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,390
The miss penalty is the memory access
time, if our hit time is similar to that

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,860
or larger than that, then the cache
is not going to be useful at all.

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,898
So this should not be selected.

13
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:47,119
Hit time equals to the miss penalty.

14
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,808
No, we want the hit time
to be significantly

15
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:51,560
less than the miss penalty.

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,605
If it is equal to the miss penalty,
we might just as well

17
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:59,175
go to memory every time, because
that's what the miss penalty is about.

18
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:00,515
So we should not sell like this.

19
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:05,425
And finally,
miss time larger than the miss penalty.

20
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:10,515
Miss time is equal to the hit
time plus the miss penalty, which

21
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:14,900
means that the miss time should always
be larger then the miss penalty anyway.

22
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,010
So this is true for every cache
not only a well designed one.

23
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,390
As we can see, for

24
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,350
a cache to be beneficial,
it needs to have a low hit time.

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,280
In fact, in a well designed cache,
we can say that the hit time is much

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,340
less than miss time
while the miss time and

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,360
miss penalty should be similar to each
other, because the hit time is so

28
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,320
small and the difference between
the two is the hit time.
