1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,620
Here’s the answer.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,630
Let’s see where it comes from.

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,890
Remember that each output is
computed from a dot product.

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,540
So, for example, let's take this output.

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,620
There are two missing values, so
let's give them some arbitrary symbols.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,710
How about w and x?

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,173
The dot product is just this equation,
basically,

8
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:23,080
the element-wise products summed
together equaling the output, and

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,420
we can repeat this for
each of the other output elements.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,020
For each blank,
I introduced a new symbol.

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,900
As you can see, we have four
equations and four unknowns, so

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,010
we should be able to find a solution.

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,750
Let's start with the third equation,
which only has one unknown.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,060
Solving for z, we get the value 2.

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,390
We can then plug this
into the fourth equation.

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,462
Solving for y, we get 7, so
that eliminates the fourth equation.

17
00:00:52,462 --> 00:00:55,923
Since we know y,
we can solve the second equation for w.

18
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:57,875
You'll get w equals 1.

19
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:01,205
Eliminating the second
leaves us just the first.

20
00:01:01,205 --> 00:01:03,724
You'll find x equals 30.
