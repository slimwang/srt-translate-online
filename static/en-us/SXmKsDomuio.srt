1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,070
>> Well honestly Andy, I'm not sure. You said it had to do with how fast the waves

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,162
are shaking. But the only difference I see here, is how spread out the waves

3
00:00:07,162 --> 00:00:08,305
are.

4
00:00:08,305 --> 00:00:12,590
>> That's a really great point Lauren. This is what's hard about drawing waves.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,392
Waves are moving all the time. And when we draw them we have to draw them

6
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:21,225
still. But your putting out when you say the wave is stretched out, maybe from

7
00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:27,056
here to here. This is called the wavelength of the wave. But for now, I think

8
00:00:27,056 --> 00:00:31,730
Susan actually brought her slinky with her today, so maybe we can go to Susan.

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,638
Susan, are you there with your slinky by any chance?

10
00:00:33,638 --> 00:00:38,005
>> Way ahead of you Andy. Once you started talking about waves, I got a contestant

11
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,286
here to help out.

12
00:00:39,286 --> 00:00:41,717
>> That's great Susan.

13
00:00:41,717 --> 00:00:45,056
>> And Susan, do you think you could actually shake your hand up and down really

14
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:48,522
slowly and make a nice low frequency wave for us?

15
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:52,900
>> Sure thing, Andy. Here is a large stretched out wave.

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:58,101
>> It is. Now what happens if you shake your hand a little faster?

17
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:01,298
>> Here, it gets much more compact.

18
00:01:01,298 --> 00:01:05,842
>> So, high frequency waves are squished together, and low frequency waves are

19
00:01:05,842 --> 00:01:07,688
spread apart?

20
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:13,160
>> That's right, exactly. So, high frequency waves have a short wavelength.

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,148
Whereas, low frequency has a long wavelength. thanks a lot Susan. It looks like

22
00:01:18,148 --> 00:01:19,865
we're actually getting ready for the next event.

23
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:22,907
>> Yep, we'll be ready soon.
