1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,200
While the center position has
16 spaces in which it can move,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,640
most other positions have 12 or less.

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,199
As the game plays, we will have less and
less spaces our player can move.

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:11,229
>> That means we can make
a better estimate on how many

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,429
nodes we have, right?

6
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,294
>> Yep.

7
00:00:13,294 --> 00:00:13,794
Okay.

8
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:16,254
We know we cannot have more
than 25 moves in a game.

9
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,654
That is the maximum depth
our tree is going to be.

10
00:00:20,655 --> 00:00:24,025
And we already know how many moves
can be done in the beginning,

11
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,296
which leaves 23 moves left.

12
00:00:26,297 --> 00:00:30,097
We know that each move after the first
two are generally going to have 12 or

13
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,807
fewer moves available.

14
00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:33,957
We'll call this the branching factor.

15
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:41,410
In worst case, we can expect 25 x 24 x
12 to the 23rd n nodes in our game tree.

16
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,019
Shelly, how many is that?

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,750
>> More than 10 to the 27th power.

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,600
>> Ouch.

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,289
Okay, that really didn't help.

20
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:50,659
Perhaps we can improve
our estimate more.

21
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,279
>> Well, we know at the end of the game,

22
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,969
there have to be progressively
fewer moves available.

23
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:58,019
There are zero moves in the end,
one move before that,

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,850
a maximum of two before that,
three before that, and so on.

25
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:02,560
>> You're right.

26
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,490
So for the last few moves, assuming a
branching factor of 12 is way too much,

27
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:10,420
that would be around
10 to the 13th nodes.

28
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:15,918
But the maximum it could be is 12
factorial, or about 5 x 10 to the 8th.

29
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:20,703
I guess, we could redo our
estimate as 25 x 24 x 13

30
00:01:20,703 --> 00:01:24,043
12's in a row x 5 x 10 to the 8th.

31
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:27,377
That's approximately equal
to 3 x 10 to the 23rd.

32
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:32,458
That is better than 10 to the 25th or
the 10 to the 27th.

33
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,140
But still seems like a gross
overestimate as most branches will have

34
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,668
much less than the maximum
branching factor.

35
00:01:38,668 --> 00:01:41,000
>> Let's see if the students
have a better answer than we do.
