00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,770
Reviews are an early step in an organization's effort to improve the quality of

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,600
it's products it produces.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,300
A more sophisticated step is to review the review process itself.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,360
That is, to collect data on the effectiveness of the reviews and

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,690
use it to improve the review process.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,120
Among the data that might be collected are the following.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,920
What was the artifact being reviewed and

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,980
at which stage of the development process does the review take place?

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,280
What was the date and time of the review and how long did it last?

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,706
Who were the participants and how much preparation time did they spend?

11
00:00:29,706 --> 00:00:33,270
How many issues were raised, how many of them turned out to be defects,

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,410
what were their types, and what were their severities?

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,460
Organizations can also collect subjective data

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,910
by distributing post review effectiveness questionnaires to the participants.

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,030
Finally, for large organizations, it makes sense to store this data in

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,770
a database for aggregate analysis over time.
