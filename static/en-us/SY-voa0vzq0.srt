1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,770
So the answer is A and D.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,620
Let's first take a look at why B and
C wouldn't work.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,870
For B, because the button overlaps
the toolbar and the content view below,

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,620
you can't really use a linear layout.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,600
Because in linear layouts,
children can't overlap.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,380
You see, because the button needs
to appear above the toolbar,

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,120
it can't be the middle child.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,860
It would need to be last.

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,490
Now A works well.

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,280
All three children of the frame layout
are anchored to the top of the screen

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,750
with varying offsets.

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,570
They're also in the right drawing order.

13
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,180
First the content, then the toolbar,
and then the button.

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,120
And D works great at well.

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,150
The toolbar and content are arranged
in a vertical linear layout.

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,190
We wrap the linear layout
in the frame layout,

17
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,030
so that we can place the button at
any arbitrary location on the screen.

18
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,260
In this case, along the right edge and

19
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,070
offset from the top of the screen
by a fixed number of DPs.
