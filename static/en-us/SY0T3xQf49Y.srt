00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,430
4000 miles is on the x axis, and we're trying to predict how much it will cost

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:12,630
in US dollars. Our predicted value, y hat, then equals 0.2 times the

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:22,450
independent variable in miles, plus 160.13. If we solve that, we get 960.13.

4
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,975
Since this is actually real data, now you actually know if you want to travel

5
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:31,025
4000 miles, expect to pay about $1000.
