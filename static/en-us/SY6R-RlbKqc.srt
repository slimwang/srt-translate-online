00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,800
Here's an example of Snort rule.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,890
Typically the root user account is
used only for specific privileged

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,510
operations such as picking out file
systems and setting up subnetworks.

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,120
It is quite uncommon to send
email using the root account.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,220
And such an event should
trigger an alert.

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,500
Here's an example of how
Snort can capture this event.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,850
It looks for traffic to the SMTP
port on any host in the /24 network,

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,520
and checks if the content
of the email contains,

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,990
mail from: root, which indicates
that a root user is sending email.

10
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,964
It then sends an alert with
the following message,

11
00:00:43,964 --> 00:00:45,976
root users attempt to send email.

12
00:00:45,976 --> 00:00:51,180
The content keyword here is one of
the more important features of Snort.

13
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,240
It allows the sys admin to
set rules that search for

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,510
specific content in the packet payload
and trigger response based on that data.
