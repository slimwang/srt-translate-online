00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,620
So when you have virtualization,
of course,

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,590
the trusted computing base
becomes the hypervisor.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,150
That comes between the hardware and
the virtual machines.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,190
So one popular open
source hypervisor is Xen.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,000
So this one is saying, we know that
Windows is millions of lines of code.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,730
So it's saying well, in compared
to that, if you have a hypervisor.

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,390
How small is it?

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,020
What's the rough estimate for the lines
of code that the Xen hypervisor has?
