1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,730
And there's two answers that are correct here--namely, the first two ones.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,170
So the error actually comes from the rounding because as we discussed before--

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,650
if we did not round, then the table size will be changed and also the solution that we get.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,160
So the objects that we picked wouldn't change, but through these rounding down here,

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,540
what can happen is that two objects that actually have a different value

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,700
now appear to the algorithm to have the same value.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:29,180
So the algorithm say of objects V₁ and V₂ and we're going to do an example here to say--

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:36,660
V₁ has a value of 8 and V₂ has a value of 9, and we're now choosing this x here to be 2,

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,150
then V₁ gets the scale down value of 4 and V₂ gets the scale value of 4.5.

10
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:48,830
Now, assuming that both objects have the same size, it would be better to take V₂ instead of V₁,

11
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:54,160
but now if we round down, both objects get a scales down value of 4,

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,730
so the algorithm might pick V₁ over V₂, although that is sub-optimal, but the algorithm

13
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,550
can't tell anymore because both objects in terms of value look the same to the algorithm.

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:09,050
The cool thing is that we can actually specify and quantify how large that error is going to be.

15
00:01:09,050 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is not right. We can't specify it and this is exactly what we are now going to do.
