1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,570
Awesome, at this point you have
completed localizing the text

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,170
in the just Java app.

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,010
Hopefully you've seen that
with just a few modifications,

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,870
you can open up your app
to whole new audiences.

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,918
Let's review our solution.

6
00:00:11,918 --> 00:00:14,410
Here's the strings.xml file

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,390
where we pulled out all
the possible strings in our app.

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,860
For each string resource
we provide a comment and

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,300
a character limit to help the translator
figure out the right translation.

10
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,670
In our layout now we refer
to string resources.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,420
There are no more warnings from
Android Studio about hard coding

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,280
strings in our layout.

13
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,250
And here's a Spanish version
of the strings.xml file

14
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,800
with all their Spanish translations.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,060
If you open up the translations editor
you can see the name of the string

16
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,345
resources, the English translations,
as well as the Spanish translations.

17
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:50,360
Then in our layout file we can refer
to all of these string resources.

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,350
And now Android Studio doesn't have
any more warnings about hard coding

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,660
strings in our layout.

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,320
Within our Java code we also
refer to these string resources.

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,150
Note that we also get the local
currency with this line of code here.

22
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:07,020
This is a utility function that formats
the input price into the current c for

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,190
the current local.

24
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,410
All of the solution code is
linked in instructor notes below.

25
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,610
Gran trabajo, great job.

26
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,220
Now let's explore further
about what else can be done

27
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,540
with resources in Android.
