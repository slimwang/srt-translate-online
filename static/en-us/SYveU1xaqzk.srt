Tolerance is an important concept that leads to two additional terms that are

2
00:00:04,335 --> 00:00:08,700
key to understanding drug use and abuse. And those are physical and

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,135
psychological dependence. So, physical dependence is a different phenomenon

4
00:00:13,135 --> 00:00:17,528
than tolerance, but they are often associated temporally. A person who is

5
00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:22,870
physically dependent needs the drug in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,803
Moreover, these withdrawal symptoms can be both physically and psychologically

7
00:00:26,803 --> 00:00:31,950
painful and challenging. Withdrawal from one particular drug can actually

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,429
result in death. Do you know which?
