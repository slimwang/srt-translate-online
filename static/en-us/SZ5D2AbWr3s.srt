My answer is it actually overshoots.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The problem is no matter how small this constant is over here,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It will eventually turns its wheels quite a bit towards it's trajectory.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Then it'll move towards a trajectory more and more,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and when it hits it, it's wheels will be straight,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but the robot itself will still be oriented a little bit downwards, so it's forced to overshoot.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What this means is that applied to a car, a P-controller will act like this.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It'll slightly overshoot, and that could be okay. The overshooting is very small.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But it'll never really converge.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It'll be what's called "marginally stable" or often just "stable" in the literature.
