00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,325
So congratulations. You've made it to the end of this unit. And we've covered

2
00:00:03,325 --> 00:00:06,603
quite a bit here. You've learned about breaking programs into modules and how

3
00:00:06,603 --> 00:00:09,783
this can make it easier to manage complexity, and learning how to manage

4
00:00:09,783 --> 00:00:13,334
complexity is one of the most important, perhaps the most important, skill that

5
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:17,125
you can develop as a programmer. And there are lots of tools for this. One is

6
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:21,803
modules. The other one that we've learned about in this class is defining your

7
00:00:21,803 --> 00:00:25,414
own types by using classes. You'll use some of these ideas in the problem set to

8
00:00:25,414 --> 00:00:28,376
make some improvements to this search engine code. They won't change the

9
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:31,704
behavior of the search engine but they'll make it easier to modify and make it

10
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:35,184
easier to understand and break into pieces. If you're paying really close

11
00:00:35,184 --> 00:00:39,210
attention, you might be curious what's going on with these magic init and magic

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,236
str methods before we define them because you'll note when we tried to print out

13
00:00:43,236 --> 00:00:46,980
a restaraunt object, we didn't get an error. We got something, just not

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,838
something very useful. And we also were able to initialize these objects before

15
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:54,274
we defined init. So there was something there already. We didn't get an error

16
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:57,240
about an undefined attribute because something was there. What's strange is,

17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,745
well, we didn't actually create anything explicitly that was there. What we'll

18
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:04,730
do next class is explain what was there. And understand how the idea of

19
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,630
inheritance will allow us to build lots and lots of classes, reusing code from

20
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,373
previous classes. Hope to see you there for the next unit.
