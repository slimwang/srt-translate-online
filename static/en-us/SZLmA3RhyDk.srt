00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,210
Let's return to our chart and
make just a small change.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,250
Instead of logging in with the API,

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,020
we can now actually use
the website to log in.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,840
The first step, getting the request
token, is still the same.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,970
So let's do that first and

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,380
then we'll cover logging in with
the website in more detail.
