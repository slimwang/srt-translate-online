1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,469
So to quickly summarize this
part of how to build panoramas,

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,980
we basically went into details what five
steps are used to generate panorama.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,090
Talked about image re-projections,
specifically with, for

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,200
the cases of panorama building.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,280
Introduced the whole
concept of homography and

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,785
how it can be computed
from two pairs of images.

7
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:22,430
And then also introduced
the whole concept of RANSAC,

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,440
to allow to deal with good matches and
bad matches and that could be used for

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,490
a variety of things including assisting
us with being able to find the most

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,690
reliable features, and also,
perhaps finding panoramas, and

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,260
then we talked a little bit about
additional things that we need to know

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,920
about panoramas, including projection
models and stuff like that.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,470
Again, this is just scraping the surface
on the whole idea of panoramas but

14
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,090
again, there are lots of other readings
that I'm going to be asking you to

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,270
look at that'll help you build a better
understanding of these panoramas and

16
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,830
we'll do a simpler assignment
on panorama building but

17
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,430
also know there are lots of
softwares out there that you can use

18
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,330
to learn how to do this kind of stuff.

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,950
Additional reading that you
should look at include these.

20
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,192
There is a whole lot of literature
out there I encourage you to look at.

21
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:10,720
There's also publicly available
softwares that you can play around with,

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,740
and also commercially
available softwares.
