00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,576
So sleep is actually a really organized process. Throughout the night, our

2
00:00:04,576 --> 00:00:08,792
brain cycles between what we call rapid eye movement sleep or REM sleep and

3
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:16,370
non-REM sleep so not rapid eye movement sleep. Non-REM sleep Has four stages.

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,922
When we fall a sleep we go down to stage I, then to, three and four. Again,

5
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:26,318
this is our deepest sleep. But then when we cycle back up we go from four to

6
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:30,223
three to two and once we get back to one we go into rapid eye movement

7
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:36,512
sleep,and this is where dreams occur. Now, rapid eye movement sleep is exactly

8
00:00:36,512 --> 00:00:39,440
what it sounds like, your eyes move back and forth really, really rapidly

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,794
underneath your eyelids. It's interesting to note that our electricity activity

10
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:49,038
during REM sleep looks pretty similar to when we're awake. Now, this whole

11
00:00:49,038 --> 00:00:52,995
cycle lasts about 90 minutes. This means that about 25 percent of our sleep we

12
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:57,868
spend in rapid eye movement sleep. And 75 percent we spend outside of rapid eye

13
00:00:57,868 --> 00:00:59,510
movement sleep.
