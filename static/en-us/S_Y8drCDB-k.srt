00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here is now finally the revelation.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My weight is obtained if you assume as standard score of 2.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It so turns out.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Can you give me a good guess what my weight will be if the standard score is 2 for me?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I should add that the mean over here is the heavier of the two numbers.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, I don't quite weight as much as here.
