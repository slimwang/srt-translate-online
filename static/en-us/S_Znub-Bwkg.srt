00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,930
In this next video,
I will implement objective one,

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,689
creating a web page that lists all
the restaurants in the database when

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,664
the user visits localhost
port 8080/restaurants.

4
00:00:08,664 --> 00:00:11,980
Once you've attempted this challenge,
proceed to the solution video.
