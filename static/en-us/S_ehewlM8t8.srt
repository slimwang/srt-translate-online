00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,320
Hi, we hope you're now all excited to build

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,510
scalable applications using App Engine and the Google Cloud platform.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,590
In this lesson, we'll get down to the nuts and

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,840
bolts of everything, and have you deploy your first code

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,340
to App Engine. This will involve an number of

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,260
different steps, but don't worry, we'll all do it in

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,420
a structured and orderly fashion to make sure you're on

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,180
your way to become a rock star App Engine developer.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,870
So let's look at what we're going to do in

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,300
this lesson. First, we're going to look at the App Engine development

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,760
cycle and create an App Engine project where you can

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,270
upload your code. Then we're going to look at cloud endpoints that

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,820
allows you to create a backend that can work with

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,160
any frontend device technology. After that, we'll get you started with

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,740
a development environment where you develop code for App Engine. And

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,480
then, we'll introduce Conference Central, the application that we will build

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,250
out throughout this course. At the end of this lesson, you'll have a

18
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,130
working application running in the Google Cloud.

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,730
Isn't that exciting? Let's go, shall we?
