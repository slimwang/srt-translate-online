1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,560
So, as we thought about
creating the purchasing flow,

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:13,910
what we wanted to do was we wanted to
create an experience that was familiar.

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,800
But, what really made it
super optimized is for

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,340
if you had a product out there
to make people purchase it.

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,060
And for us,

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,240
it is really important.to make it
like a clean purchase experience.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,890
And so, as we thought about how we
wanted to make our purchase flow

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:36,140
uniquely Teespring, one of the things
which we did realize was that

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,810
Teespring content is very much targeted.

10
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,850
Or is very much optimize for
people wanting to show

11
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,570
it to their friends and share it like on
all the different platforms out there.

12
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,410
And so one of our thoughts
was how can we make this

13
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,480
an experience where kind of people are
actually purchasing from the page but

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,420
at the same time encourage them to

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,519
share it via email, Facebook, Twitter,
Pinterest and all these other channels.

16
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,290
And so that was kind of the only other
kind of special optimization layer,

17
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,160
I'd say,
that we did on the purchase flow.

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,173
But otherwise,
the purchase flow kind of is a very

19
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:23,863
[INAUDIBLE] understood thing
across most e-commerce companies.
