1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
When you divide 4 by 36, you get 0.111, or in percent, 11.1%.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's the mortality rate of sick people in the hospital.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's 0 for the healthy people.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The mortality rate at home is 50%--half of them pass away--

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and 0.25% approximately for healthy people.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Now, if we look at this, we realize that you are likely sick.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If you fall into the sick category,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
your chances of dying at home are 50% and it's just about 11% in the hospital.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, you should really go to the hospital very quickly
