1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,879
I'll begin by distributing these coefficients to what's inside the parentheses

2
00:00:03,891 --> 00:00:07,590
on either side of the equation. Now that I've done that, we have very pretty

3
00:00:07,602 --> 00:00:11,357
integer coefficients. And we don't have to worry about fractions at all. Now

4
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:15,015
I'll get all the variables on the left side of the equation, and then I'll move

5
00:00:15,027 --> 00:00:18,670
all the constants over to the right. Last, I just divide by 4, or of course,

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,254
equivalently, multiply by 1/4. And we get a final answer of x equals negative 22

7
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:28,996
over 4. But wait, this is not a fraction in simplest form. Both 22 and 4 are

8
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:33,500
divisible by 2, so I can cancel those 2's out, and I end up with negative 11

9
00:00:33,774 --> 00:00:38,982
over 2. So that, in fact, is the correct answer, x equals negative 11 over 2. I

10
00:00:39,078 --> 00:00:43,542
can look back at the top and plug this in to check. And in the end, I get

11
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:47,489
negative 21 equals negative 21, so we are good to go with this answer. Awesome

12
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:47,809
job.

13
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:52,933
Just as a side note, you also could have written several other equivalent things

14
00:00:52,945 --> 00:00:57,455
for our answer, -11 over 2. You could have had negative 5 1/2, or you could also

15
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:59,868
have written negative 5.5. Any of those three are correct.
