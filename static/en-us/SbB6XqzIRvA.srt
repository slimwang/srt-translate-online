00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,680
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:03,740
You've made it to the last
lesson of this course.

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,110
And now it's finally time
to talk about objects.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,609
>> Objects are an incredibly
powerful feature of JavaScript.

5
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:13,139
They allow us to wrap up
pieces of related data and

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,589
functionality, into
one single container.

7
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:19,399
If you remember back to our
previous lesson on arrays,

8
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:22,459
arrays are a special kind
of object in JavaScript.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,130
Arrays have properties like length and
methods like reverse, sort, push, and

10
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:28,000
pop.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,609
That make them useful for
working with structured organized data.

12
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:34,469
>> But
objects are not just limited to arrays.

13
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,170
JavaScript comes with a whole set
of other useful built-in objects.

14
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,020
Plus, you can even
create your own objects.

15
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,320
For example, throughout this course,
you're seeing code about Facebook

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,560
profiles, bank accounts, cats, crew
members, a donut shop, and so much more.

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,170
Each of these things had data
associated with them and

18
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,950
functions that we used to manipulate or
operate on that data.

19
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,570
With objects, we can take this
a step further by organizing or

20
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,840
encapsulating all of the data and

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,530
functionality associated with
a particular thing inside an object.

22
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,308
>> For example,
take this umbrella [SOUND].

23
00:01:10,308 --> 00:01:12,459
I really like umbrellas.

24
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:16,079
And we could create this umbrella
as an object in JavaScript.

25
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,909
In fact, we could take almost
any real world object and

26
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:21,450
represent it as a JavaScript object.

27
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,140
>> Let's take a look at how we
might write code to represent

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,950
Julia's umbrella.
