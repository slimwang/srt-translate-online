00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,308
You know you want 1/3 of 1/2 to be 1/6, so
somehow I need to get 1. Well, 1 * 1 is 1,

2
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:07,574
so I know I need to multiply the
numerators, so if you chose

3
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:11,993
multiplication, great. And then for the
denominator, I need 6. Well, I know 3 * 2

4
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:16,042
is 6, so it must be multiplication as
well. Whenever we take a fraction of a

5
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:19,714
fraction, we multiply the numerators and
multiply the denominators
