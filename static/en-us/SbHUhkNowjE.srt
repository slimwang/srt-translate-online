00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,690
The best way to understand
the Soul is to see it in action.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,310
Let's create a simple
example in Android Studio so,

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,020
that we can see all the parts, and
how to build and install them.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,210
Android Studio includes templates for
all the popular Android platforms and

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,755
so we can create one very easily here.

6
00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:17,380
In Android studio select File > New
> New Project, and you can fill in

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,570
whatever you want as the defaults
because we're not using this for

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,660
anything important.

9
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,630
Click Next.

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,870
We select Phone and
Tablet with the defaults and

11
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,440
we also select Wear with
a minimum SDK of at least API 21.

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,360
Click Next.

13
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,590
For the mobile activity just select
the default blank activity and

14
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,110
leave everything with
the default activity names.

15
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,400
Now you'll see we have the option
to select a wearable activity.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,310
In this example we'll
use Blank Wear Activity.

17
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,349
But you'll notice that you can also
create a notification or a watch face.

18
00:00:43,349 --> 00:00:44,648
Those will come in handy later on.

19
00:00:44,648 --> 00:00:47,881
Once again you can leave the activities
with the default names and

20
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,860
than click Finish.

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,990
So, now I want you to
replicate the same steps.

22
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,990
After the project is fully created,

23
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,890
how many build.gradle files do you have
appearing in your project browser?

24
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,070
Choose one of the answers,
one, two, three, or four.
