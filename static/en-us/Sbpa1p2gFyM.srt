00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,536
To continue this problem, we're just going
to apply the distributive property to both

2
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:07,700
this part of the expression and this part
of the expression. And now we simplify

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,054
within each term and combine like terms.
One quick thing to take note of before I

4
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:15,344
write the final, final answer for this
question, let's look at each of these

5
00:00:15,344 --> 00:00:21,131
terms. First we have x^2.
Now x^2 is just x times x, or x times x. The first

6
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:26,331
terms, in each of our factors, multiplied
together. Then we have 5 times x, or the

7
00:00:26,331 --> 00:00:28,904
second term of our first factor
multiplied by the first term of our second

8
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:34,452
factor. Then we have -2x, which is just 
-2 times x. The first term from our first factor

9
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:40,082
times the second term of our second
factor. And lastly, -2 times 5. Or -10, which

10
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:46,429
is just this factor, 5, times this factor,
-2. So you can see that we've taken every

11
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:52,270
combination of pairs of terms from these
two factors and multiplied them together

12
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:58,084
in order to get our final answer, which is
just x^2 + 3x - 10.
