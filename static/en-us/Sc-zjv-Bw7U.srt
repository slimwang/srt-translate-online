00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:04,427
Here are our answers. Equation e, would shift our graph up by 6 units, that's

2
00:00:04,427 --> 00:00:09,130
why we have a plus 6 outside the original function. And if you want to shift

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,272
down instead, you need to subtract. In this case, we're subtracting by 1 with

4
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:18,680
equation d. Equation c, which of the graph left by five units since we're

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,570
adding to x. And graph a would do essentially the opposite, it would shift the

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,226
graph right, this time, by four units. Finally, graph b here, f of x equals

7
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:33,036
negative x squared, represents that reflection in the x-axis of the original

8
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:38,212
graph. This negative sign out in front of the original function takes all of

9
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:41,740
the function values of the original graph and flips them across the x-axis,

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,339
makes them negative.
