00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,656
In this exercise, I've set-up two viewports on the screen. A perspective view

2
00:00:03,656 --> 00:00:07,322
and a top view orthographic camera. I should mention there's one extra thing to

3
00:00:07,322 --> 00:00:10,754
set on the renderer in 3JS, when using multiple viewports, renderer autoclear

4
00:00:10,754 --> 00:00:15,246
equals false. This setting tells 3JS to not clear the screen before rendering

5
00:00:15,246 --> 00:00:19,640
the viewport. The top view works by defining the volume and space. The up

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,866
vector for the view is set, somewhat arbitrarily, to be the plus x axis. During

7
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:27,130
rendering the camera position itself is set to be up one unit, looking down at

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,006
the target. The idea is to look at the target and then move back a bit to

9
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:34,906
establish the look at direction. Note that the look at and up directions should

10
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:39,462
never be parallel. Your task is to add two more viewports. Add a front viewport

11
00:00:39,462 --> 00:00:43,232
to the upper left, side the the lower right. The front viewport should look up

12
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:47,695
along the positive x axis, the side viewport down along the negative z axis.

13
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:51,010
Both the front and side viewports should track the target position similar to

14
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,899
how the top viewport works. When you're done, the program should look like

15
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:55,450
this.
