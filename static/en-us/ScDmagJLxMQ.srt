1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,250
The first option should be checked.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,390
If it is attractive because you're not
just getting information about a few

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,070
people, but lots of people.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:14,160
Finally, query languages that
are used to access data can be abused

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,990
to gain unauthorized access, okay?

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,790
So we talked about software security and
vulnerable software and

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:22,830
things like that.

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,760
And, actually, we're going to see
that I mentioned that SQL is used

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,670
to write the programs for the queries
that we run against databases,

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,430
and people exploit the way we
formulate those queries for

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,930
example, and I will again
access to databases via that.

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,160
So the attack rectors, and

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,140
if they make it easy for them to
gain access to the data, of course

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,460
that makes the target attractive
because it's easy to get to it.
