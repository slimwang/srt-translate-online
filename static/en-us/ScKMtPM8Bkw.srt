We just looked at the polynomial x squared plus 8x plus15. But what if I change

2
00:00:04,888 --> 00:00:09,771
this very slightly. Instead, I'd like us to look at x squared minus 8x plus 15.

3
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:14,572
Let's see if we can factor this. As before, I'm going to say that this is equal

4
00:00:14,572 --> 00:00:19,370
to the product of two binomials. One of which is x plus some number a, and the

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:24,266
other of which is x plus some number b. In this case, what do a and b need to

6
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:28,357
multiply to equal. And what do they need to add to equal?
