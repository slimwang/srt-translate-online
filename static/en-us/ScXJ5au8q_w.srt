00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:04,080
Okay, everybody. Welcome back. This is a little

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,070
mini lesson, we are going to do, talking about how

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,370
to use templates. And we are going to spend a

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,810
lot of time today in our editor and browser,

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,310
basically working together to build a few templates in

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,500
a simple web application. So let's start with what

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,390
a basic web application looks like. Here we have

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,060
a, a basic little web application. This is effectively

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,940
the Hotel World homework that you did from lesson,

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,549
from the first lesson. And you know as you can

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,920
see it doesn't really do much. It's got one

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,980
handler on slash called main page. Which is here. And

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,640
all it does is it prints the string hello,

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,580
Udacity. I've made my main page handler inherit from a

15
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,910
class called Handler, which I defined up here. And

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,430
this just adds one method called Write. And all write

17
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,390
is, it just lets me print a string without

18
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,870
having to type self response.out.write, I can just type

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,500
self .write. And we'll be adding a few more

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,660
helper functions, to this handler, as we go. So we've

21
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,815
got this basic file here, we've got this basic

22
00:01:06,815 --> 00:01:10,420
app.yamal, you know, nothing, nothing crazy here, this is,

23
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,060
this should all be familiar to you by now.

24
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,440
Lets go ahead, and make sure this works. We go

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,350
to our terminal. I'm in the template lesson directory,

26
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,670
where these files are. As you can see, ,we'll run

27
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,830
the app server, like so I, I prefer to run

28
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,070
the app server from the terminal so I can just

29
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,660
see what's going on, and can kill it easily,

30
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,180
it's telling me we're running at local host 8080, so

31
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,890
let's go ahead and check that out in browser. We'll

32
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,580
go to local host 8080. We'll load this page, and

33
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,740
we see our text that I typed hello, Udacity!

34
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,590
Let's just make sure everything is working as expected.

35
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,650
I'm just going to change this string, adding a

36
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,480
few exclamation marks. I'll save this file and the go

37
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,170
back to our browser and reload, and just make

38
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,930
sure that everything is working end to end. Okay.

39
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,280
Here I am in the browser. I reload. My

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,700
extra exclamation marks appeared. So we are all good there.

41
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,169
Now in this slide, I'm going to ask you lots

42
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,430
of questions like, what happens when you do x or

43
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,970
y or whatever. So try to follow along with

44
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,740
me as we go. that'll, that'll kind of keep things going

45
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,220
smoothly. Now you're remember if from the end of

46
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,630
your homework from lesson two um,where we made a basic form, if you want to make

47
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:31,770
a basic form we can just return html directly from our handler here. So

48
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,050
I'm going to add a quick string that represents an HTML form.

49
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,760
I'm going to start with a triple quota string. This is basically

50
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,050
the python syntax for a multi line string. Anything I type

51
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,930
between these two triple quotes will just be a part of a

52
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,230
string, including other quotes and such. So, it just makes it

53
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,200
typing html a little easier. Okay? So, a form tag, remember

54
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,960
that just starts a form. A little h2 tag, that will

55
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,770
just add a little title. An input box, type text and we'll

56
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,430
give it the name food. And the button to

57
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,790
add this food. Now it looks like we're building

58
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,740
some sort of food or shopping sort of thing

59
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,950
and indeed we are, we'll kind of build there as we

60
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,720
go. But for right now its going to start with

61
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,090
this basic form. App returns this html and the fact,

62
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,160
I am going to rename this form html, so it's

63
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,900
little bit easier to see down here. So, lets replace

64
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,337
this text with form HTML and we will give

65
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:29,260
this a [UNKNOWN] in the browser. Reload the page. And

66
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,780
I see a basic form. Now, recall that since

67
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,940
we didn't set a method on that form, the default

68
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,910
method is going to be GET. Which means when I

69
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,170
submit this form, it'll just add that parameter to the

70
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,780
URL. And let's go ahead and see that work. Okay,

71
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,550
so I, typed in a food in the text box.

72
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,780
And when I hit enter, the page reloaded with

73
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,340
the food I just entered in the URL. Our first

74
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,350
quiz is going to be. When I type in a

75
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,600
new food. In this text box and hit add. What

76
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,950
happens? When I submit a new food in the

77
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,030
text box, what happens? Choose the correct answer. The food

78
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,870
parameter in the URL updates to match our new food.

79
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,930
Do we see a second food parameter in the URL,

80
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,490
so it'll have both steak and eggs in

81
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,350
the URL. Or, does the browser report an error?
