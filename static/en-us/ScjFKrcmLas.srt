00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,020
The answer is shuffle and sort. That's the phase

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,290
between mapping and reducing. It ensures that the values

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,340
for any particular key are collected together, then sends

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,160
the keys and their list of values to the reducer.
