00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
I suppose that wasn't too difficult for you.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,170
PTAS clearly is the most powerful approximate ability,

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:11,170
because with PTAS you can get any constant factor approximation that you want.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,210
It is the smallest bubble in here.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,980
Then we have the constant factor algorithms. So these here.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,390
Then finally we have all of those problems for which there's

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,890
neither a constant-factor algorithm nor a PTAS up here.

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,680
We already briefly mentioned that any Las Vegas algorithm can be turned into

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,980
a Monte Carlo algorithm, and for that reason the complexity class of all problems

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,600
for which there are Monte Carlo randomized algorithms, contains the complexity class

11
00:00:35,600 --> 99:59:59,999
of all problems for which there are Las Vegas algorithms.
