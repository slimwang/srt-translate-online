1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,740
I think I misused my powers.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,339
Where are we?

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,519
It looks like we're inside somewhere
crazy, but I don't know where, and

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,390
I forgot my phone.

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,970
Wait, I have an idea.

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,650
I can use the Google Geolocation API
to figure out where I am.

7
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:19,169
The Geolocation API is useful for
devices or

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,770
machines that don't already have
Geolocation built in natively.

9
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,149
Devices that run on Unix,
Linux, TinyOS, RIOT or

10
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:30,015
other operating systems might have
a need to know their location.

11
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:33,075
There are plenty of machines
in the Internet of Things.

12
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:36,345
A giant network of internet enabled
devices that qualify for this.

13
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:39,484
The Google Geolocation API,

14
00:00:39,484 --> 00:00:42,585
provides a web service they can
use to get location information.

15
00:00:43,774 --> 00:00:45,989
They can pass information
from cell towers or

16
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,164
WiFi nodes, to the Geolocation API,
to get back the location and

17
00:00:51,164 --> 00:00:53,204
accuracy radius on where the device is.

18
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:58,439
It's the perfect API for
detecting location indoors, or

19
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,439
when GPS is weak or unavailable.

20
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:05,069
For example, the giant particle
accelerator behind me,

21
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,049
if it's internet enabled,

22
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:12,289
could tell me that I'm in France at
the [FOREIGN], also known as CERN.

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,305
But I probably shouldn't be here,
so let's move on.

24
00:01:16,305 --> 00:01:20,104
[SOUND] Oops, my bad.

25
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:22,269
Still trying to get
a hang of this thing.

26
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:24,614
While I practice, let's take
a look at what we've done so far.

27
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:26,443
