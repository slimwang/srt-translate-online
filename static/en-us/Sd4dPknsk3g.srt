00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
In the web, over the last five or 10 years, we've kind of established a new type of partner

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,840
and those are traffic partners

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,710
In a traffic partner, we have long-term agreements with other companies

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,830
that deliver predictable levels of customers to our website.

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,640
How do we do that?

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,260
Well, these are sometimes cross referral or swapping deals.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,000
We pay another company may be on a per-referral basis

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,850
and our partners, our traffic partners, drive traffic using text links, on-site promotions

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,700
and ads on their site and sometimes, we might even exchange email list

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,060
and other data with these partners.

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:52,190
So, if you're on the web, traffic partner is a virtual channel partner

12
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,620
that simply doesn't exist in the physical world.
