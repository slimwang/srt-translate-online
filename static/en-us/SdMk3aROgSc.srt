1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So what have you learned?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In Bayes Rule, there will be more than just 2

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
underlying causes of cancer/non cancer.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
There might be 3, 4, or 5, any number.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We can apply exactly the same math,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
but we have to keep track of more values.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In fact, the robot might also have more than

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
just 2 test outcomes.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Here was red or green, but it could be red, green, or blue.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And this means that our measurement probability will be more elaborate.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I have to give you more information,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but the math remains exactly the same.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We can now deal with very large problems

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that have many possible hidden causes

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
of where the world might be,

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and we can still apply Bayes Rule to find all of these numbers.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me give you one final test.
