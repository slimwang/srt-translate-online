00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:01,400
Thanks, Amir.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,240
Let's drill down into different types
of ideas that you could dream up.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,320
The first type of idea
is a simplify idea.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,140
With these types of ideas,
you're trying to make a process or

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,430
a task much easier for your user.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,370
Instagram did this by simplifying
the process for combining images.

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,350
They have an app called Layout which
allows you to combine photos from your

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,540
camera phone into customized layouts.

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,510
Another type of an idea
is a Me Too idea.

10
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,765
It's where you take a current idea and
you bring it to a new market.

11
00:00:29,765 --> 00:00:31,895
Flipkart is a Me Too idea.

12
00:00:31,895 --> 00:00:35,305
Similar to Amazon, the company
leverage market insights in India

13
00:00:35,305 --> 00:00:37,965
to pioneer concepts such
as cash on delivery.

14
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:41,575
Flipkart also partnered with other
companies to provide exclusive sales on

15
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:45,315
its website, since it had such
a deep understanding of India, and

16
00:00:45,315 --> 00:00:47,115
its user's needs.

17
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:49,610
Virtualize is another type of idea.

18
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,830
It involves moving an activity
to the online space.

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,420
Need to do your taxes?

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,050
Turbo tax allows you to send off
your tax forms electronically.

21
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,630
You can even do them from
your mobile phone or tablet.

22
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,820
Need to hail a cab?

23
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,310
Lyft makes this process
also really seamless,

24
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,760
you can do it right
from your mobile phone.

25
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,020
For this type of idea, it's important
to think about how you can leverage

26
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,890
existing technologies or
build upon new technologies.

27
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,330
For example, Lyft used the fact
that everyone had cell phones and

28
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,790
GPS locations to provide cab
service to people on demand.

29
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,030
You might also try to remix or
combine two or more ideas.

30
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,530
Slack, an online messaging tool is
one great example of a remix idea.

31
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,330
Slack is a team communication tool
that streamlines e-mail, chat, and

32
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,290
private group messaging while
making all content searchable.

33
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,890
I can chat up my fellow course
developers or I can put in an order for

34
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,550
some late night food.

35
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,880
Finally, there are types of ideas that
seem impossible or almost impossible.

36
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,870
These types of ideas are just
like Google's project Loon.

37
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,230
Project Loon attempts to bring
internet to the rural and

38
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,089
remote areas of the world
using helium balloons.
