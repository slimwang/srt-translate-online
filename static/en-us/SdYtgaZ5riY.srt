1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,910
So, we made these three histograms, and let's take a

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,770
closer look at them. We have one for females, one

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,860
for males, and one for NA. NA stands for Not

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,570
Applicable. And the third histogram we just created contains users who

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,570
are not labeled as male or female. This is how

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,980
R handles missing values. Missing values take on a value

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,420
of NA. Let's try creating our histogram for friend counts

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,680
split by gender one more time. But this time we'll take

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,300
a subset of our data and ignore the observations where the

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,810
gender is an a. To do that, I'm going to subset our data.

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,940
I can use the Subset command. And use a condition for the

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,570
second parameter. The first parameter is just the data set. Here I'm

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,830
using the is dot NA function with a bang. This removes

14
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,870
any rows that have NA for the gender variable. So if I

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,170
run this code this time I shouldn't see the NA and fixing

16
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,490
a small typo I can see I have my two histograms for

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,160
females and males. Now I do want to point out there's

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,470
another way that we could have subset the data. If,

19
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,210
instead, I use the na.omit function, I would remove any

20
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,110
observations that have NA in them, not necessarily just for gender.

21
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,160
You want to be careful when using the na.omit wrapper since

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,370
we might end up ignoring some users that are labeled as

23
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,210
male or female But, they might have different variables that

24
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,060
do have NA values. Say for like friend_count or something else.
