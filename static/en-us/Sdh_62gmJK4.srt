00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,173
>> We saw earlier that we can rate the standard form for the equation of a

2
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:08,784
parabola as y equals Ax squared plus Bx plus C. So the equation that produces

3
00:00:08,784 --> 00:00:13,443
any parabola should be able to be written in this form. And recently what we've

4
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:17,835
been doing is taking equations that are written in this standard form and

5
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:22,646
replacing y over here with 0. So in general that gives us something like this.

6
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:27,182
Now we know that this is no longer an equation for a parabola. This is not going

7
00:00:27,182 --> 00:00:31,739
to give us any points to graph since we only have x as our single variable. This

8
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:36,080
value of 0 isn't varying, so it's not a variable. It's just a constant. This

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,544
kind of equation, or an equation that you can write in this form, is called a

10
00:00:40,544 --> 00:00:45,294
quadratic equation. Now a quadratic equation has one of the same restrictions

11
00:00:45,294 --> 00:00:50,221
that the standard form for the equation of parabola did. This coefficient A here

12
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:54,561
is not allowed to equal 0. What I would like you to tell me now is what the

13
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:59,392
degree of a quadratic equation is. Think back to what you learned about the term

14
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,459
degree way back the very beginning of the course.
