00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,560
That was a whirlwind tour of Kubernetes.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,540
Like Docker, Kubernetes makes
it really easy to run and

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,400
introspect our applications.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,320
That's what I call automation.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,320
This lesson shows you many of
the deployment primitives Kubernetes

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:13,820
offers Dev's.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,780
At this point, you should be able to
see the power of Kubernetes" higher

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,320
level abstractions which allow you
to focus on your application more so

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,400
than managing an employment.

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,480
But what if I told you these
were just the basics and

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,780
the next lesson we're going to
take off the training wheels and

12
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,610
learn to not only scale your
application automatically.

13
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,990
But how to perform rolling
updates without downtime.

14
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,420
How to work with sensitive
information and so much more.

15
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,190
See you in the next lesson.
