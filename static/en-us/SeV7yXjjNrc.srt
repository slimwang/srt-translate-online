00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,525
Here, the inverse function is x plus 5 divided by 6. Great thinking, if you

2
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:10,897
found this inverse function. One way to find the inverse is to switch the x and

3
00:00:10,897 --> 00:00:17,772
y variables. Once we switch x and y, then we can solve for y. So, adding 5 to

4
00:00:17,772 --> 00:00:24,259
both sides, will get x plus 5 equals 6y. Then, we'll divide both sides by six,

5
00:00:24,259 --> 00:00:30,827
to get y equals x plus 5 divided by 6. And remember, our last step is to

6
00:00:30,827 --> 00:00:36,998
replace this y with f inverse of x, since this represents the inverse function.

7
00:00:36,998 --> 00:00:41,219
Now, the other way to reason through this answer is to think about what we did

8
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:48,136
to x. We multiplied it by 6, and then subtracted 5. So we want to undo this

9
00:00:48,136 --> 00:00:53,275
subtraction of 5, and then the multiplication of 6. We always undo the last

10
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:59,162
operation we performed. So first, we'll take x and add 5, and then we'll divide

11
00:00:59,162 --> 00:01:05,668
that quantity by 6. We'll do the opposite of multiplying by 6. This also will

12
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:07,420
give us our inverse function.
