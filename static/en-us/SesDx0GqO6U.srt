00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,110
Let's first take a look at the contents of an HTTP Request. First there's

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,810
the Request Line which typically indicates first,

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,620
a method of request. Where typical methods

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:20,310
get to return the content associated with the URL. A Post which sends data

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,230
to the server and a Head Request which returns, typically, only the headers of

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,120
the Get Response, but not the content. It's worth

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,250
noting that a Get Request can also be used

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,560
to send data from the content to the server.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,240
The request line also includes the URL which is

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,050
relative, and may be something like index.HTML and it

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,120
also includes the version number of the HTTP protocol.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,090
The request also contains additional headers, many of which

13
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,650
are optional. These include the referer, which indicates the

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,540
URL that caused the page to be requested. For

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,980
example, if an object is being requested as part

16
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,970
of embedded content in another page, the referrer might

17
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,600
be the page that's embedding the content. Another example

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,220
header is the user agent, which is the client

19
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,500
software that's being used to fetch the page. For

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,430
example, you might fetch a page using a particular

21
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,850
version of Chrome or Firefox. And the user agent

22
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,780
informs the server which, client software is being used.
