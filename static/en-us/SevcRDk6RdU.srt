1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,220
>> So, what, how do you start with this now, Charles?

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,540
>> Okay, so the first thing I'm going to do is,

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,860
I'm going to look at the first two examples. And the

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,130
reason I'm doing that is because I know they both

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,450
generate true. And so I'm going to look for variables that

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,150
are inconsistent. So if I look at X1, for example,

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,840
it's a one in the first case, and a zero

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,990
in the second case. So it can't be the case

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,230
that it's required in order for this to be true.

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,970
And the same would be true for x3. So I'm going to say that neither x1 nor x3

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,540
matter. By contrast, x2, x4, and x5 all

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,600
have the same values in both of those cases.

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,118
>> So we don't know much about them quite yet.

14
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:38,194
>> No

15
00:00:38,194 --> 00:00:41,940
>> But let's so let's, that seems very well reasoned. So we

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,330
know that x1 can't be part of this formula and x3 can't

17
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,240
be a part of this formula. So, let's just sort of imagine

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,440
that they're not there cause they don't really give us any information

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:50,780
any more.

20
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,640
>> Beautiful.

21
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,780
>> Alright, So what's left?

22
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,000
>> So what's left is now to make certain that x2, x4 and x5 are

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,870
necessary, and particularly necessary with the, the values

24
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,670
that they have. So I guess all I

25
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,300
can really do is see if there's anything

26
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,090
else to eliminate. If I were just looking

27
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,846
at the first two, I would think that the answer was not X2, X4, not X5.

28
00:01:09,846 --> 00:01:15,946
>> Alright. so, hang on, not X2, X4, not X5.

29
00:01:15,946 --> 00:01:19,750
>> Right. So, that's what I currently think it is based upon what I just saw.

30
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,200
>> And that would be, that's consistent with the first two examples.

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,980
>> Right. And so, now I want to make certain is consistent with the

32
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,020
next three examples. This is the easiest way for me to think about

33
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:35,020
this, anyway. So, let's see. Not X2, X4, so that should be false, which it is.

34
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,760
They're all false, so let's see not X2. But x4,

35
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,910
up, that should be false, which it is. And then I do that

36
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,830
same thing. But wait, why isn't that the answer? That can't be the answer.

37
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,730
>> Is the answer you got it.

38
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,650
>> Huh I got it right.

39
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,640
>> So the thing to notice is that in these first two examples

40
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,380
we have X2 is false X4 is true and X5 is false and that's

41
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,500
enough to make the conjunction true but making. Flipping any one of those

42
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,830
bits is enough to make it false so what I showed in the in

43
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,310
the remaining examples is that just by turning this

44
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,790
X2 into an X1 leaving everything else the same

45
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,280
we lose it. Similarly if we flip the X4

46
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,260
to zero and leave everything else the same, we

47
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,350
lose it. Similarly if we flip x5 to one,

48
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,640
and leave everything else the same, we lose it.

49
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,160
So that means that each of these is necessary

50
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,010
to make the conjunction. They're all actually in there.

51
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,050
>> That's just what I was thinking. So, in

52
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,000
other words, you gave me some positive examples to

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,030
eliminate things that were necessary, and then you gave

54
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,210
me negative examples to validate that each of the variables

55
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,250
that I saw so far were necessary because getting rid

56
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,430
of any one of them, gave me the wrong answer.

57
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,530
>> Exactly. Let's, let's even write down those

58
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,140
two steps. So the first thing was show

59
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,180
what's irrelevant. And how many questions How many

60
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,000
queries might we have needed to show that?

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,800
>> Well, one per variable.

62
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,210
>> Well actually we only need two because

63
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,570
what I did is I, I used, all the relevant ones I

64
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,970
kept the same and all the irrelevant ones I flipped from one

65
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,600
to the other. I just have to show you that it's still,

66
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,960
the output is still one even though they have two different values.

67
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,690
>> Oh, no, no. When I said all of them, you know, k of

68
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,335
them was because I didn't know that, what if all of them were irrelevant

69
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:15,620
>> Then it would still be two. because then I

70
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,860
could just show you the all zeroes, and the all ones.

71
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,220
>> You're right. You're right. You just

72
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,040
need, oh that's right. That's exactly right.

73
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,830
>> Alright. And

74
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,560
then I have to show you that the, that

75
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,290
each, the remaining variables is relevant by flipping it

76
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,170
and showing you that the answer is zero. And

77
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,580
how many questions did I need to do for that?

78
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,900
>> Three.

79
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,760
>> Yeah, three in this case cause there were three variables

80
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,490
that were used in the formula. What's the most it could be?

81
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,010
>> Well k, cause all of them could be relevant.

82
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,450
>> Yeah, so it's you know, it's kind of interesting that, that

83
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,800
in fact the total number of hypothesis here is three to

84
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,110
the K. Because you know, you can see it right

85
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,190
off this table that for each of the variables, it's either

86
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,540
positive, absent or negated. But the number of questions that a

87
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,220
smart teacher had to ask was more like, K plus two.

88
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:58,380
>> Huh.

89
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,460
>> Which is pretty powerful.

90
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,500
>> Right, so. The smart teacher can help me

91
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,370
do this in linear term. So what if I

92
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,470
were, I, I didn't have the teacher who could

93
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,550
give me these examples and I always had to ask?

94
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,720
>> That's a good question, let's let's do that.
