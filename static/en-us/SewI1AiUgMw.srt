00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You finished Unit #2, and you now know a lot about scatter plots.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
They tend to be 2-dimensional, and real-world scatter plots look often just like this

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
where a simple eyeballing tells us something about the relationship

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
of one variable to another.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now, scatter plots aren't great when there is what is called "noise."

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That is, the data deviates from the exportation in some random, noisy way.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In the next unit, we talk about a simple plot called "bar chart"

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that addresses the issue of noise in data by pooling data points into a single cumulative bar.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So stay tuned.
