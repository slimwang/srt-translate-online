1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,010
Given opens and closings dilations,
erosions, this hit or

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,390
miss transform that I was talking
about that pulls out the shape.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,200
You can then do further things, okay?

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,010
Here's a list of them.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,210
Boundary, region, extracting connected
components, convex hull, thinning,

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,090
skeletons, pruning.

7
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,740
I'm just going to talk about two,

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,270
and I'm really just going to
talk about one in detail.

9
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,210
Not even detail, one slide's worth.

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,730
And then thinning,
I'll just mention, okay?

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,290
So sometimes,
you like to extract the boundary.

12
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,390
Well actually, that's very easy to do.

13
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:34,220
What I can do is, I can take an object.

14
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,760
If A plus B is the dilation, and

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,790
A minus B is the erosion, I can get the
boundary by just taking the object and

16
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,770
subtracting out
the eroded version of it.

17
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,730
Here, they talk about B
being a 3 by 3 square,

18
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,162
it could be whatever size square.

19
00:00:48,162 --> 00:00:50,670
I'm going to take the binary pixels, and

20
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,810
I'm going to remove any of the ones that
survive the erosion process, all right?

21
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,770
So you want to do that, and voila.

22
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,750
This is what you get.

23
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,873
And you realize,
what's happening here of course,

24
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:02,770
is here's our original binary image.

25
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,625
And when I erode the, you know, the
contour moves in by a certain amount.

26
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:11,244
And if it's three by three by at
least one and a half, two pixels, so

27
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:15,500
what that'll do is, if I subtract what's
inside the red from the whole thing,

28
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,900
I end up with just this boundary.

29
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,420
So, it's just a trivial operation right?

30
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,760
I, I take the image, erode it, and then
subtract those pixels, and by subtract,

31
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,470
I mean remove those
pixels from the original.

32
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,640
And that's how you do boundaries.

33
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,020
There's another operation
called thinning.

34
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,500
You'll, you'll notice
this operator here.

35
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,920
This is this hit or miss operator.

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,428
What matters is,
you take your original picture and

37
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:39,000
you've got these different
structuring elements.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,672
And essentially, you keep eating away
a at your picture using that structure,

39
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:47,926
that structuring elements, and
you would go from this filled in picture

40
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:52,340
like this, you would end up with,
with something that's just like this.

41
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,542
Or it's a one Ppxel wide thin band,
all right?

42
00:01:56,542 --> 00:02:00,390
When you keep doing the thinning, and
that can be used for finding skeletons.

43
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,830
There used to be a lot of thought
about using skeletons for

44
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,340
a variety of shape representations
when we're doing models, and

45
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,690
people still use it and
that's why I mention it.

46
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,060
But I'm not going to talk,
anymore about it.

47
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,360
It's just thinning and thickening.

48
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,360
And in fact, the thickening
is just the inverse of that.

49
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,880
So here you have this original thing,
and then you're

50
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,540
growing it out till you get out towards
the, the boundary of some sort.

51
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,680
Again, I'm not going to worry
too much about the details.
