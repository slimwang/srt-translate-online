One area where interactive 3D graphics is used extensively is in what's called

2
00:00:03,905 --> 00:00:07,860
previsualization. That's where a director sets up a virtual world and sets his

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,190
cameras lights and so on. Doing this can cut cost and speed delivery. What

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:22,495
follows are some interviews with The Third Floor, a previsualization company.

5
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:27,630
[MUSIC] The third is a previz studio. We specialize in pre-production of all

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:33,543
types. working with different directors in both commercials video game

7
00:00:33,543 --> 00:00:38,349
cinematics and feature films. The Third Floor originally was founded up at the

8
00:00:38,349 --> 00:00:42,780
Sky Walker Ranch. We actually referred to the third floor of that building

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,670
where we were. Sequestered for a number of years on Star Wars episode three.t

10
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,840
At the end of our tour duty, we decided to get together and form our own studio

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,310
down here in Los Angeles. And Action. We made it a mission of ours to create a

12
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,849
room where we can have a virtual film making experience. Directors like to work

13
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:10,290
with a virtual camera. So we have a system that allows them to manipulate a

14
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,540
camera with a sensor on it. That's fed live into Motion Builder that actually

15
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,525
lets them manipulate around the Motion Builder camera. We have actually added a

16
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:26,840
Wacom tablet. And we use that as our viewer. And our input device for operating

17
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,010
a camera inside the virtual world. From there if we do integrate the motion

18
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:36,330
capture suit. We can record this information and they can actually create their

19
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:41,170
own shots. It really is an exploratory process that, that opens up the

20
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,180
directors to whole host of new possibilities.
