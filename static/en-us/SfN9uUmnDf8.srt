1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,270
So to familiarize yourself with complexity theory and computability, here's our first quiz.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,060
As in any Udacity course, the quizzes are here to help you see

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,420
if you have understood the content, and they do not count toward your final grade.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,070
So our first quiz will be about familiarizing yourself

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,600
with the areas of computability and complexity theory.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,590
Here I have 3 questions that you could ask in theoretical computer science.

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,960
So how fast can a computer find a way between 2 points on a map?

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,900
Can a program decide if another program is malware?

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,700
So, for example, a virus or trojan.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,100
And how much memory is needed to sort a given database?

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,080
What I would like to know from you, for each of these 3 questions here,

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,980
is if that question would be studied in computability

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,460
or if that question would be studied in complexity theory.

14
00:00:49,460 --> 99:59:59,999
Please make your selection for each of these questions.
