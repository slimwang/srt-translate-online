1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,500
Just to show you some examples.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,320
So, here we have two pictures.

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,870
I wish I knew where these pictures came from.

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,330
These are, like, so hysterically cheesy.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,090
Two pictures of a toy giraffe.

6
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,740
You'll notice that a couple of things.

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,870
First of all, obviously the orientation has changed a lot.

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,830
But also the head has been rotated, right?

9
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,780
So, here it's on the side, and

10
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,210
here he's facing you, and so things have shifted a bit.

11
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,810
the, the feet are a little different.

12
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,720
Of course, the entire object is rotated and the intensity has changed.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,410
So, there's been quite a bit of change done to the image.

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,400
So, here we go.

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,960
We compu, we compute our derivatives, we compute our moment matrices,

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,730
we compute our R functions.

17
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,410
We plot them in MATLAB, using a interesting pseudocolor colormap, and

18
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,040
you see this beautiful picture.

19
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,180
And that's R everywhere.

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,080
And the next thing you have to do is threshold that.

21
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,120
So, here are all the points that R is above some particular threshold.

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,110
Then we do that trick of the non-maximal suppression, right?

23
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:08,290
So, we only keep points that are locally higher value than anybody else.

24
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,290
And this is probably pretty hard to see.

25
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,740
Megan helped a little bit by putting this line down the middle.

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,880
So, there's this constellation of points on the left and the right.

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,270
You know, if I look at that, I can't really tell it's a giraffe.

28
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,880
But, what I can do is,

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,220
I can show you those red points on the actual giraffe itself.

30
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,300
This is a giraffe, right.

31
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,290
Yeah, it's kind of a, kind of a weird giraffe.

32
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,580
Somebody's fanta, it's like a creepy giraffe.

33
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,950
It's like always smiling.

34
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,580
Anyway.

35
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,180
All right.

36
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:40,550
And here you can notice that we've found a bunch of points repeatedly.

37
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,930
So, for example, on his nose,

38
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,070
on the right nostril there, there's a point right there.

39
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,090
Well, guess what?

40
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,630
We found the same point right there.

41
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,430
So, I wanted to see how the head was, was changing, right?

42
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,050
Points on the ears are there, okay?

43
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,730
Points on the back of this spot here are there.

44
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,890
Points on the bottom are there.

45
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,800
Now, of course, all of these points, they're not there.

46
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,720
Well, of course not.

47
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,860
There's a specular reflection in the left image that's not in the right.

48
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,620
That's okay.

49
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,419
Harris couldn't possibly know about that.

50
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:17,340
The point is, ha-ha, that we reliably found many of the same points.

51
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,615
And if you remember what we were talking about for doing this interest point, or

52
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:24,500
keypoint detector, we need a reliability and a precision.

53
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,470
We have to find the same points and

54
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,630
find them in the same location on the scene or in the scene.

55
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,550
And that was what would make a good feature
