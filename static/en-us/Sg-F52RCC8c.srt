1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,584
So, the way you compute this is to take this 10 to the 19th. And there's 10 of

2
00:00:04,584 --> 00:00:08,080
those, so that's 10 to the 20th. And then we have a billion computers in the

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,776
world. So that knocks 9 off of that so it's only 10 to the 11th now. And each

4
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:15,758
computer does 10 to the 6th. So that whacks another 6 off giving you 10 to the

5
00:00:15,758 --> 00:00:19,958
5th. And 10 to the 5th is 100,000 Earth's worth of computers. So that's the

6
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:24,106
answer. That's all you need. If you went for 10,000,000 you were thinking way to

7
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:28,289
high and those extra computers could run World of Warcraft, or something.
