I want to think about what number multiplied by 3x is 12x squared. That must be

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:12,144
4x. Again, to get that, we simply divide the first term 12 squared, by the first

3
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:18,104
term of our divisor, 3x. 12x squared divided by 3x is positive 4x. 4x times 3x

4
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:23,207
is 12x squared. And 4x times negative 2 is negative 8x. Now we're ready to

5
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:28,547
subtract this expression, which means we change both of these signs. The first

6
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:33,569
term is negative and the second term becomes positive. 12x square minus 12

7
00:00:33,569 --> 00:00:38,731
square equals 0, and 1x plus 8x equals 9x. Fantasic work if you got all four of

8
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:39,645
those boxes.
