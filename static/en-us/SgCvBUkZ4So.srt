1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,220
In this lesson, we'll talk most specifically about what you should expect from

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,750
CS7637. We'll start by talking about the learning goals, the learning outcomes,

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,180
and the learning strategies that we'll use for this class.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,540
Then we'll discuss the class projects and assessments. That will lead us

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,370
to talking about something called Computational Psychometrics, which is one of

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,009
the multi-weighting principles behind the projects in this class.

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,470
Next we'll talk about the Raven's Progressive Matrices test of intelligence.

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,070
I think you're going to find it fascinating. The Raven's Progressive Matrices

9
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,370
test of intelligence are the most commonly used tests of human intelligence. And

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,040
that test was the target of the projects in this class. Very ambitious,

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,237
you're going to enjoy it. FInally we'll discuss something commonly

12
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:48,890
reoccuring principle in this class and you should be on the lookout for them.
