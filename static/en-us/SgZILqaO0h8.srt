1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,110
All right, so let's walk through this solution line

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,530
by line. We first initialize an empty array, word counts.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,460
We then cycle through all of the lines in

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,350
the document. For each line in the document we create

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,820
an array, data. Data is the line stripped of

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,680
any surrounding white space and tokenized based on the white

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,820
space. For each string in data, we create a new

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,590
key. And we remove any punctuation from the word and

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,270
make sure that the word is lower cased. Then, we

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,210
check if the key exists as a key in word counts.

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,860
If it does, we add 1 to the value for

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,750
that key. If not, we initialize that key in the word

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,630
counts dictionary and we set it equal to 1. When

14
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,110
we've cycled through all of the lines And all of the

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,400
keys in each line. We print out the dictionary word_counts.

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,830
Which should have a count of each word, in our document.
