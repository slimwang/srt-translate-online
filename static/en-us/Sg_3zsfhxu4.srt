1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,620
We define stress as the response to a

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,455
situation that a person perceives to be
overwhelming

3
00:00:05,455 --> 00:00:11,660
in that the person does not think he or
she can meet the demands of the situation.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,684
The interesting thing to note here, this
is the perceived

5
00:00:14,684 --> 00:00:19,500
inability to meet the demand of the
situation facing them.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,320
For example, perhaps you have a ten page
paper due in two days.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,758
In addition, you have to work nights, and
you have a test the same

8
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:27,450
day the paper is due.

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,226
For some people, they may perceive this to
be

10
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:31,002
way too much for them to handle, and feel
that

11
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:32,970
they're unable to meet the demands of
getting the

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,670
paper done, studying for the test, and
going to work.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,400
Thus, the person in this situation is
experiencing stress.

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,414
This is true for having projects due at
work or

15
00:00:43,414 --> 00:00:47,481
also having to take care of household or
family responsibilities.
