1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,420
So to give a response then, you'd actually just swap the

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:08,760
source and destination ports, and the source and destination IP addresses.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,112
The path back will feel just like the path forward, though

4
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:14,000
it's possible that it will follow a different set of hops.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,329
And of course it will be in the reverse. When the

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,660
packet gets back, to the mo, router at your house, it

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,380
will swap out the IP and port for the correct ones

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,760
as part of the network address translation. It's routing table will

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,210
then tell it the MAC address of your computer, so that

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,810
it can be put in a packet in a link layer frame

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,800
and passed back to your computer. Now, to complete the handshake,

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,220
and establish the TCP connection, your computer needs to send back an

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,670
acknowledgement to Udacity. This will be almost exactly the same as

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,200
the first packet with just a small change to the TCP header.

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,320
Indeed all the communication will feel much like this, only instead

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,950
of sending packets with no contents, Udacity will send each other real

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,360
data, with the TCP headers, IP headers, and then sometimes on and

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,180
off during the transmission, the link layer headers and footers as well.
