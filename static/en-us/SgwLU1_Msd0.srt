1
00:00:00,749 --> 00:00:04,429
One thing I've noticed about this code is, it's a bit spaghettified.

2
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:05,107
>> What?

3
00:00:05,107 --> 00:00:07,355
You mean like it's falling into a black hole?

4
00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:08,724
>> What?

5
00:00:08,724 --> 00:00:10,004
>> Never mind.

6
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:11,483
It's an astronomy thing.

7
00:00:11,483 --> 00:00:15,740
>> It's spaghettified as in it's a mess of IF statements and loops.

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,160
Let's break this down into some more manageable chunks by using some functions.

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,910
>> Functions are awesome.

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,920
Hey, have you read the book East of Eden by John Steinbeck?

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,070
>> This isn't a literature class.

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,160
>> I know, but stick with me.

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:31,790
This is relevant.

14
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,230
I was reading it the other day, and there was a passage that struck me.

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,630
The story takes place around the turn of the century, and

16
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,640
one of the characters named Adam gets a car.

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,130
This was a big deal because cars were really new.

18
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,030
Back then, you couldn't just stick a key in the ignition and get rolling.

19
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,300
There was a long intricate process of priming the ignition,

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,990
getting oxygen into the engine, et cetera.

21
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,970
The boys in the story had a mantra that they kept repeating to

22
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,230
help themselves remember the process.

23
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,340
>> But all of this is automated now, right?

24
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,940
Turn the key, start the car.

25
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,720
>> Right.

26
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,080
You know, in the book, the characters had to pass instructions about the way

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,410
engines work in order to start the car.

28
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,550
Today, all of those instructions are bundled in the act of turning the key.

29
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,040
Functions do basically the same thing.

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,080
They bundle instructions together.

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,440
>> So if I had a start car function,

32
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,350
it would abstract away all of the intricacies of starting a car.

33
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,550
>> Yeah, exactly.

34
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,300
>> Okay, that was a decent example.

35
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,850
Functions in JavaScript can be defined with two different syntaxes.

36
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,330
The first should look pretty familiar if you've been paying attention.

37
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,930
We start with var followed by the function name,

38
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,880
in this case myFunc equals, and then the word keyword function,

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,970
an optional parameter list, and then the body of the function.

40
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,730
This keyword function tells the JavaScript engine that we're making a function.

41
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,250
>> And this is the second syntax.

42
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,350
In this case, we don't actually have to start with var.

43
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,760
We just start with this keyword function and then we give our function a name,

44
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,648
which, in this case, is still myFunc.

45
00:01:58,648 --> 00:02:02,910
Then after myFunc, we have optional parameters inside parentheses and

46
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,000
then the body of the code goes between the two curly braces,

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,758
just the same way we do with if statements and loops.

48
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,060
These two syntaxes are pretty much equivalent.

49
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,460
There are subtle differences in the way the JavaScript engine interprets these

50
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,800
two different functions.

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,860
However, they go beyond the scope of this course.

52
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,700
So check the instructor's notes if you're interested in learning more.

53
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,610
>> Seems to me we should bundle the code we just used to

54
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,240
populate the work experience inside the display work function.

55
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,130
>> Yeah. Let's do that and see what happens.

56
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,440
Here's a quiz for you.

57
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,950
We want you to move all the code you just wrote to display the work

58
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,360
into a function called display work.

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,580
Make sure you put all of your code between the curly braces, but

60
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,290
don't do anything else after you've moved your code into display work.

61
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,230
What happens when you refresh the page?

62
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,890
Pick one of these two answers.

63
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,380
Do you see the same thing or does nothing appear at all in the work section?
