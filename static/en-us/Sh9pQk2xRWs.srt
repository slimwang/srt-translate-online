1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,300
So some of these you
probably already knew, but

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,400
I hope you looked up some of them too.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,980
jpg is the most common
file name extension for

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,030
the jpeg image format which is
the most common format for photos.

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:15,400
LICENSE in all caps is a really common
name for software licenses on Linux and

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,730
other systems.

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,380
It's a plan text file.

8
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,030
Well, it's usually written in legalese
but technically that is plain text.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,660
Now if you've used GitHub,

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,140
you've probably seen a file
called README.md before.

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,790
It's a text file in markdown format.

12
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,320
This next one is one
that surprised me a bit.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,090
A lot of crypto keys are stored in
files with names ending in pem.

14
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,720
The keys for ssh for SSL web
servers are usually in pem files.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,580
What does pem stand for?

16
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,250
It turns out this format was created for

17
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,640
an old project called
privacy enhanced mail.

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,790
That project didn't go much of anywhere
but the file format stuck around and

19
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,000
we still use it.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,780
And for the last one, install.sh,

21
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,950
whenever you see a .sh file,
you're looking at a shell script.

22
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,270
A shell script is just a text file
consisting of shell commands.

23
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,319
Pretty much anything you can
do from the command line,

24
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,360
you can do in a script, too.
