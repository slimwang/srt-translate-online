1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,670
Casting relies on smoothly
coordinating two or more screens.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,330
The users should never feel
like they're doing work.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,970
Successful cast apps
have a familiar UI and

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,370
controls that minimize
the user's learning curve.

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,190
The receiver UI should be smooth and
cinematic and

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,740
feel as uncomputerlike as possible.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,280
To help you build the best
possible cast experience,

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,790
Google provides a visual
design checklist.

9
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,620
Although following this checklist
is optional to publish your app,

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,240
it's highly recommended and

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,680
required if you'd like your app to
be featured at chromecast.com/apps.

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,600
To make it easier to build a UI
that follows these guidelines,

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,790
Google provides
the Cast Companion Library for Android.

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,570
This contains ready built features and
components you can reuse in your app,

15
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,510
also samples are available for
all platforms supported by Cast.

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,400
We'll cover both of these
later in the course.

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,700
For now, let's take a look at
the key points from the checklist.

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,610
Once your app is Cast enabled,
you'll want to let your users know.

19
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,030
A great way to do this is to show
a one time Cast Introduction Screen.

20
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,600
This is useful both to alert experienced
users to the new capabilities and

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,540
also to teach novices.

22
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,340
You can find a link to
this particular screen,

23
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,120
which you can reuse in your app,
in the instruction notes.

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,250
Next, it's important that users can
start and control casts at any time.

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,550
We recommend that the cast icon should
always be visible in the upper right

26
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,930
corner of your app whenever
a cast receiver is available.

27
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,900
When a receiver is not available,
don't show the icon at all.

28
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,990
And the color of the icon should
change to reflect the connected state.

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,450
Users should be able to easily control
the Cast device at any time and

30
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,250
from any place in your app.

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,530
It's important to always show playback
controls when you're casting.

32
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,190
These can either be full screen, or you
can show a persistent mini-controller

33
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,910
when the user is navigating
elsewhere in your app.

34
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,450
It's also important to show playback
controls when your device is locked, and

35
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,310
here's how it looks on
Android 5.0 Lollipop.

36
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,500
The task companion library makes doing
this very easy on any version of

37
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,820
Android, although the appearance might
differ slightly from version to version.

38
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,020
It's also important to show
playback controls via notification

39
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,130
when your app is out of focus.

40
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,570
If you use the task companion library,
you can also startup the notification's

41
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,760
service, so this notification will
show even if your app is killed by

42
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,240
the operating system, so
the user can always control the cast.

43
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,070
Also, make sure that users can always
disconnect from the device, and

44
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,240
they can bring up this disk
menu from the cast menu.

45
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,490
And keep in mind that if
multiple users are connected,

46
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,410
only stop the actual cast when
the last user disconnects.

47
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,830
In the event the connection
to the cast device is lost,

48
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,540
automatically reconnect users
when they're in your app.

49
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,410
Connections can drop for
a couple of reasons, for

50
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,880
example the WiFi could go out of
range or the users battery could die.

51
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,830
Also keep in mind that if your app
is killed without gracefully exiting

52
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,570
the cast session and the user
restarts your app, you can try and

53
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,950
rejoin the existing session
if its still running, and

54
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,490
the cast companion library will
make this task very easy for you.

55
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,120
Now a user can start
casting in one of two ways.

56
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,460
They can connect to the cast device and
then begin playing media, or

57
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,610
they can start playing media and
then connect to the cast device.

58
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,560
Either way,
once the user starts casting,

59
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,200
whatever they play in their act should
automatically be cast to the tv.

60
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,750
At this point, the phone is going
to allow the users to browse and

61
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,500
control the cast while the tv
displays the streaming content.

62
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,870
Remember the sender always
shows the action and

63
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,410
the receiver always shows the state.

64
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,920
It's very important that your Receiver
UI should never appear touchable, and

65
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,320
you should definitely not re-use
an existing phone or tablet UI.

66
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,030
If you do so this is going to confuse
your users and make them very unhappy.

67
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,730
On your Receiver UI it's important
to keep the users' content

68
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,960
front and center.

69
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,270
If they pause playback be sure to fade
away your controls after about five

70
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,790
seconds so they can see the full screen.

71
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,040
Let's recap with a quick quiz.
