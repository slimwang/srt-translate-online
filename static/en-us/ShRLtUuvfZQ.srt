1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,240
All right,
you're ready to answer these questions?

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,830
>> Yes, I think I am and
I think I know the answers.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,910
I think they're yes, no, no, yes.

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,370
>> Great.
That's actually correct.

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,340
You want to tell us how you
can actually argue that?

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,620
>> Well, no but I'll do it anyway.

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,800
So let's take the ones that I
think are pretty easy, two and

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,300
three so
without even coming up with an example,

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,670
I think it's pretty easy to see
that those are contraction mapping.

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,190
And here is why.

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,920
So let's Imagine I started
out with two functions.

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,186
Let's say they were six and eight.

13
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:33,083
>> Okay.

14
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:36,590
So, we are going to say X equals 6 and
y equals 8.

15
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,330
>> Yes, but Y is the other function.

16
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,430
Well, what's the difference
between them?

17
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,410
It's 2.

18
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,370
>> So just let's make sure we
are applying this in the right context.

19
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,710
What we want is that the distance

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,840
before we've applied any operator to
them is going to be bigger than or

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,280
equal to the distance between them
after we've applied the operator.

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,710
>> Right.

23
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,620
And it has to be
the gamma's less than one.

24
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,660
This actually becomes important.

25
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,050
>> That's right.

26
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,250
All right, so you did x-y is 2, uh-huh?

27
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,930
>> Right, well x-y is 2, well when I
add 1 to both of them that'll just

28
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,860
become 7 and 9, but
the difference is just 2.

29
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,470
>> Okay, so

30
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,540
I do buy this, that adding one to
something shouldn't be a contraction.

31
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,040
But it seems like subtracting one from
something should make them smaller.

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,370
>> Right.
Except it makes both of them

33
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,470
smaller in exactly the same way.

34
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,659
And so, you're basically keeping
the distance between them constant.

35
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:31,880
>> Good point.

36
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,310
And in fact the same example works here.

37
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,160
So, 6 and 8 are 2 apart.

38
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:43,250
6 minus1 and 8 minus 1, or 5 and
7, are still exactly 2 apart.

39
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,590
So, 2 is not less than or
equal to any gamma less than 1 times 2.

40
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,130
>> Right.
>> So, yes,

41
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,010
I agree that these are not
contraction mappings and

42
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,020
the proof basically involved showing
a particular value of X and Y such that

43
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,345
they're not getting any close together,
they're staying the same distance apart.

44
00:01:58,345 --> 00:02:00,620
>> Right and I think you can even prove
that by just basically writing down

45
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,510
the equation that relates X and
Y together.

46
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,350
Y is equal to X + 2, if I subtract
a constant from both sides or

47
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,630
add a constant to both sides
it doesn't change anything.

48
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,210
>> Very good.

49
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:11,740
>> All right.

50
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,190
So for the first one, x over 2.

51
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,240
Here's my thought process, and kind of
the proof that I ran through in my head,

52
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,950
and then the realization that I had
that made four actually easier as well.

53
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,760
Okay, so why don't you erase that?

54
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,500
And I'll give you an example
of what I was thinking.

55
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,890
All right.
So the x over 2 thing,

56
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,700
I thought are you going to
just keep dividing by two.

57
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,210
So let me come up with
an example in my head.

58
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:34,820
And I thought, oh,

59
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,340
I should use a power of two because
then I can keep dividing by two.

60
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,350
>> Hang on.
Hang on.

61
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,590
Well okay we'll let
you step through that.

62
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,220
But that's not going to
get us all the way there.

63
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,490
>> No it's not, but-
>> Okay, let's do it anyway.

64
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,690
>> Well I was just going
through my thought process.

65
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,430
Okay.

66
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:48,930
>> Great.

67
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,700
So just for
the sake of thinking out loud,

68
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,770
let's say x is 16 and y is 32.

69
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,680
So what's the distance between them?

70
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,128
Well it's 16.

71
00:03:01,128 --> 00:03:02,067
>> Good.

72
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:04,828
>> Now if I divide both of
them by 2 I get 8 and 16,

73
00:03:04,828 --> 00:03:05,640
>> Right.

74
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,826
>> And the distance between them is 8.

75
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:12,010
>> Good, all right, and
8 is definitely less than 16.

76
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,130
>> Right, but then I realize, oh,
this is actually pretty simple,

77
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,630
I'm glad I chose a power of 2.

78
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,040
That basically the distance between
x and y at any given, let's say,

79
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:28,630
time step, I chose x to be some 2 to
the n and y to be 2 to the n plus 1.

80
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,980
And then if I divide both of them by 2,

81
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,940
then the new distance will be 2
to the n minus 1 and 2 to the n.

82
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,840
>> Sure, but
this is only showing that it works for

83
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,970
things that are like consecutive powers
of 2, which is not what we need.

84
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,520
We need it to hold for all x and y.

85
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,300
>> Right, but that was the process that
I went through in my head to kind of

86
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,560
show that this will keep working.

87
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,280
And then I realized what's really
going on is I'm taking my value X and

88
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,180
making it smaller.

89
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,870
>> Sure.
But that's true of number three also.

90
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,466
>> That's true, but I'm making
it smaller in a geometric way.

91
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:06,814
>> [LAUGH] Okay.

92
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,760
>> You don't like it there?

93
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,760
>> To me, the easiest way to step
through this is to do the algebra,

94
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,880
to say that Bx is x over 2,
By is y over 2.

95
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,260
>> Yeah.

96
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,652
>> So the absolute difference
between them is actually equal to

97
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:28,300
1/2 of the distance between X and Y.

98
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,200
>> Yeah that's fair.

99
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,340
>> So I'm just factoring that.

100
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,730
And that gives us exactly what we want,
which is to say that the difference

101
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:39,140
before compared to the difference after
applying the operator is less than or

102
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,240
equal to some less than one value
multiplied by the old distance.

103
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,190
>> Yeah, that makes sense because
that's exactly what I was

104
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,450
doing when I went from 16 to 32 to 8 and
16.

105
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,150
>> Exactly, yeah.
>> I noticed

106
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,730
the distance was cut in
half every single time.

107
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,620
>> Right.

108
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,710
>> Okay, but
that general thing is going to work for

109
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,190
number four as well, right?

110
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,080
So the first thing to do to make that
really easy is to realize that although

111
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,841
you've written it as X
plus 100 times 0.9, so

112
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:05,440
I could rewrite that as
X times 0.9 plus 90.

113
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:05,940
>> Good.

114
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,630
>> Right.
So the X times 0.9 part is going to

115
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,750
keep reducing by exactly the same
argument that you did before.

116
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,110
I could take out the 0.9 and show that
it's just going to keep getting smaller.

117
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,420
So that parts going to get smaller and
since I'm adding a constant

118
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,310
every single time, it's not going to
change the actual distance.

119
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:25,980
>> Good.

120
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,400
>> So it will continue to get smaller.

121
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,340
>> Yeah, that's right.

122
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,760
And so algebraically,
if we have whatever X and y were before,

123
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,960
after we applied this operator, as you
just pointed out, it's actually going to

124
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,190
be 0.9x minus 0.9y, plus 90 plus 90, but
then they're going to get subtracted.

125
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:51,130
Ans so
this quantity is equal to .9 x minus y.

126
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,290
You just factor that out.

127
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,260
So whatever the distance was before
is actually contracting a little bit,

128
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,650
it's getting a little bit smaller, nine
tenths the size of what it was before.

129
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,110
>> Right.
And so, there are two things there.

130
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,740
One is, adding a constant, whether
the constant is positive or negative,

131
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,580
doesn't change the distance, because
they're going to cancel each other out.

132
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,630
That's why two and three don't work.

133
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,880
And then multiplying your
function by a number that is

134
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,450
less than 1 will make them get
closer and closer together.

135
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,530
Which suggests that if we were instead
to multiply them by a number greater

136
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,550
than 1, or actually 1 or

137
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,660
greater, you would end up with
something much much much worse.

138
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,860
If we get bigger and bigger and bigger
it would be an un-contraction mapping.

139
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,360
>> [LAUGH] Expansion mapping.

140
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,600
>> Yes, so expansion mapping,
I like that.

141
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,350
>> Great, okay nicely done.

142
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:40,850
>> Cool.
