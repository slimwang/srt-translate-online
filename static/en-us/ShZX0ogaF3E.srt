00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,586
>> First, probably the most important thing, is that we actually quarry whether

2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:07,173
or not all the images have been loaded. If we don't do this little step, where

3
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:10,757
we query this.fullyLoaded, then what's going to happen is you can go through

4
00:00:10,757 --> 00:00:14,397
your draw function trying to draw image data that hasn't actually been loaded

5
00:00:14,397 --> 00:00:18,323
into memory. Of course, you'll just see nothing on the screen but it's generally

6
00:00:18,323 --> 00:00:21,907
a good practice to let the entire thing load before you try to start working on

7
00:00:21,907 --> 00:00:25,574
it. Next, we actually loop through all of the layers. And for each one,

8
00:00:25,574 --> 00:00:29,077
determine whether or not it's actually a tile layer. Remember, we can actually

9
00:00:29,077 --> 00:00:32,539
get object layers from the tiled setup. So, we need to make sure that we're only

10
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:36,133
rendering tile layers. From there, we actually create a convenient handle to the

11
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:39,667
data array. And then we walk through all the tile IDs inside of that data array.

12
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:43,065
If it equals zero, we go ahead and continue on because no tile needs to be drawn

13
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:46,484
there. If it's not zero, we go ahead and grab the packet information for this

14
00:00:46,484 --> 00:00:46,790
tile.
