1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,040
So in this case, the answer in false.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,400
The reason is that the iterations
aren't independent.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,260
For example, I equals 5 depends
on the outcome of i equals 4,

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,060
which was produced in
a previous iteration.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,480
So you'll need another way.
