00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,536
Bizarre behavior is the last of the positive symptoms associated with

2
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:08,310
schizophrenia. By positive, we do not mean pleasant, but instead we mean the

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,140
presence of. So we've seen the presence of delusions, hallucinations,

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,832
disorganized speech, and bizarre behavior. In addition, we also have the

5
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:23,068
negative symptoms. And these can include non-responsiveness, emotional

6
00:00:23,068 --> 00:00:29,490
flatness, immobility or catatonia, which is striking a strange pose. We also

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:36,626
see reduction in speaking. The inability to complete tasks. Sometimes a lack of

8
00:00:36,626 --> 00:00:41,724
motivation. And even diminished cognitive function. We also see that sometimes

9
00:00:41,724 --> 00:00:45,444
people no longer tend or take care of their personal hygiene and they often

10
00:00:45,444 --> 00:00:49,960
have little to no interest in interacting with others.
