1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,376
So the world is becoming more and more mobile,

2
00:00:03,376 --> 00:00:07,288
and so the expectation is that the sorts of things we do with big GPU's today--

3
00:00:07,288 --> 00:00:11,209
maybe one day we'll see being done with something you carry in your pocket,

4
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:15,480
so where do you see GPU computing having an impact on sort of the mobile world?

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,619
>> Well like I said, computing is just sort of everywhere,

6
00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:20,100
and it's certainly coming to the mobile space.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,525
I think cell phones today are replacing our laptop PCs,

8
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:27,227
and there are opportunities, and there are new mobile devices.

9
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,517
It's something that is always on, we're carrying it with us,

10
00:00:29,517 --> 00:00:32,603
we're interacting with people and friends, as well as ourselves with the device,

11
00:00:32,603 --> 00:00:35,404
and that's another opportunity for computing to make a difference.

12
00:00:35,404 --> 00:00:37,569
Camera is one area,

13
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:42,021
and one thing you do see is that cell phones are starting to take over the digital camera market,

14
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:47,355
and there are things that you can do with a digital camera, with a processor, with an interactive test screen--

15
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:52,248
things like computational photography and computer vision with the camera

16
00:00:52,248 --> 00:00:57,812
that just wants to be done on the device and really changes it from a point-and-shoot thing

17
00:00:57,812 --> 00:01:01,162
to a more dynamic interface to something interactive,

18
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:03,863
and I hope to see some really cool stuff happen there.
