00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,830
If you we're writing code
to control this umbrella,

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,599
you would first create an object
to represent the umbrella.

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:09,419
One way to define an object
is to create a variable and

4
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:13,310
assign it to a pair of empty
curly braces like this.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:18,039
You can verify that umbrella is
an object by using the type of operator.

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:22,869
The type of operator will return
a string that tells you the data type.

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,350
However, an empty object
is not very interesting.

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,890
Objects have properties and
things they can do.

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,990
To add this information, you can define
key value pairs for each piece of data.

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,530
Here, we've defined a property
key called color, and

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,960
it's value is pink,
since it's a pink umbrella.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,939
This umbrella also happens to be closed,
so

13
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:47,859
you can add a property called isOpen and
set its starting value to false.

14
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:51,975
Now you have an umbrella object,
it's pink and it's closed.

15
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:56,674
Opening the umbrella is a task you
want the umbrella to be able to do.

16
00:00:56,674 --> 00:01:01,304
It's not a property which is an
attribute that describes the umbrella.

17
00:01:01,304 --> 00:01:04,105
Something the object can do is a method.

18
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:07,564
A method is just a function
that's associated with an object.

19
00:01:07,564 --> 00:01:09,700
You've actually seen methods before.

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,939
Back when you used push and
pop with erase.

21
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:17,219
Push and pop are methods to add and
remove elements from an array.

22
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:19,545
Here is a method that
opens the umbrella.

23
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:23,147
[BLANK_AUDIO]

24
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:26,200
If you're a little confused right now,
it's okay.

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,150
Objects can be tricky to wrap
your head around at first.

26
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,500
But be patient.

27
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,689
We're going to go into more
detail in how to create objects.

28
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,239
Define property, and methods, and
use these objects in your code.
