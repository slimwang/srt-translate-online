1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The answers are the first sentence has erroneous syntax.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We're using an and here between 2 terms, but you can't do that.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
An and can only be used between sentences and predicates in first-order logic.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The second sentence does correctly encode the English sentence

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Paris and Nice are both in France.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Similarly, the third sentence does correctly encode

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
there's a country that borders Iran and Syria,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
but the fourth one incorrectly encodes it.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Here we have an existential. There exists a C.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And then an implication, and that's usually the wrong thing.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The problem here is not if C represents a country,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
but what if C represents something that's not a country, say my dog.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My dog is not a country, so there does exist a c,

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
which is my dog, such that this implication is true

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
because whenever the antecedent of an implication is false,

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
my dog is not a country, then the whole thing is true.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
For the final sentence in English, no 2 bordering countries

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
can have the same map color, both of these are correct encodings.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The first one seems more obvious,

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and the second one we've just manipulated things a little bit.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We know that A implies B is the same thing as saying not A or B,

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
so here we've just taken the left-hand side and negated it

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and then put those all together with an or,

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
so these 2 sentences represent the same thing,

25
00:01:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and they're both correct.
