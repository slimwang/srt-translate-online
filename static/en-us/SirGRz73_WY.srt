Here are the four answers. Great work if you found those. We know what pattern

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:09,100
of I repeats every fourth power, so we want to take this power of 21 and divide

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:16,160
it by 4. Doing so we get 5 remainder 1. This means I to the 21st power is

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,520
equivalent to I to the 21, which we know is really just I. For the second one

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,498
we'll take the power of 11 and divide it by 4... Which is 2 remainder 3. So we

6
00:00:26,498 --> 00:00:31,190
know i to the 11th, is equivalent to i to the 3rd, which equals -i. Since i to

7
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,950
the 48th is a multiple of 4, we end up on a power of i to the 4th, which is

8
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:42,344
really just 1. When thinking about it with a remainder, we know 48 divided by 4

9
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:48,400
equals 12 remainder 0. i to the 48th is equal to i to the 0, which equals 1.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,910
And finally for i to the 66th, we divide the power by 4 to get 16 remainder 2.

11
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,997
This means that we cycle through the patterns of i 16 times and then wind up

12
00:00:57,997 --> 00:01:03,330
with i squared, which is equal to negative 1. If this is still giving you

13
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,744
trouble try repeating these values all the way up to i to the 11th. You'll

14
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:11,443
start seeing the pattern repeat and hopefully you'll catch the hang of it.
