1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
If I go ahead and execute this and print the result,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
it comes out: 13/27.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Wow! Where did that come from?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So that' surprising--first of all, it's not 1/3,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which you might have thought should be the answer

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
if you believe the argument that Tuesday doesn't matter.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And secondly, not only is it not 1/3,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
but it's much closer to 1/2 than it is to 1/3.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So just having the birthday there really changed things a lot.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
How did that happen? Well, I wrote up a little function here

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
to report my findings, and here's its arguments.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You can give it a bunch of cases that you care about--

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the predicate that you care about

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and whether you want the results to be verbose or not.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And it just prints out some information--

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and, by the way, as part of this,

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I also looked at the question of

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
what's the probability of two_boys,

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
given that there's one boy born in December

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
so I threw that in as well.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And here's the output I get: 2 boys, given 1 boy is 1/3;

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
2 boys, given at least 1 boy born on any day is still 1/3;

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and born on Tuesday is 13/27,

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and born in December is 23/47.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Now, I can turn on the verbose option to report

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
In that case, here's what I see:

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The probability of 2 boys, given at least 1 boy--

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
born on Tuesday--is 13/27.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And here's the reason--at least 1 boy, born on Tuesday,

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
has 27 elements--and there they are--

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and of these, 13 are 2 boys--and there they are.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And so, you can't really argue with that.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You can go through and you can make sure that that's correct,

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and you can look at the other elements of the sample space

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and say no, we didn't miss any--

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
so that's got to be the right answer.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's not quite intuitive yet, and

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'd like to define my report function

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
so that it gives me that intuition

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
but right now, I don't have the right visualization.

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So I've got to do some of the work myself.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And here's what I came up with:

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We still have the four possibilities that we showed before

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
but now we're interested, not just in boys--

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
we're interested in boys born on Tuesday.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So there's going to be some others over here

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
where there's, say, boy born on Wednesday,

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
along with some other partner--

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
maybe a boy born on Saturday.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But we're not even considering them; we're throwing all those out.

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We're just considering the ones that match here.

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And like before, we draw 2 circles:

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
one of the right-hand side of the event--

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
of the conditional probability.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And so how many of those are there?

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, there's 7 possibilities here

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
because the boy has to be born on Tuesday--

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
there's only 1 way to do that--but there's 7 ways for the girls to be born.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So there's 7 elements of the sample state there;

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
likewise, 7 elements over here.

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Now how many elements over here?

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well here, either one of the 2 can be a boy born on Tuesday.

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So really, we should draw this state

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
as either a boy born on Tuesday, followed by another boy

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
or a boy, followed by a boy born on Tuesday.

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And how many of those are there? Well, there's 7 of these

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
by the same argument we used in the other case,

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and of these, there's also 7

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
but now I've double-counted because in one of these 14 cases

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
is a boy born on Tuesday, followed by a boy born on Tuesday.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So I'll just count 6 here.

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And so now it should be clear: 7, 14, 21, 6, 27.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
There's 27 on the right-hand side,

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and then what's the probability of 2 boys,

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
given this event of at least 1 boy born on Tuesday?

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Well, 2 boys--that's here--so it's 13 out of the 27.

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So that's the result.

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Seems hard to argue with.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Both the drawing it out with a pen

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and the computing worked out to the same answer.

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Now why is it that we have a strong intuition

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
that, knowing the boy born on Tuesday

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
shouldn't make any difference?

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I think the answer is because we're associating

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
that fact with an individual boy.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We're like taking that fact

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and nailing it on to him--and it's true.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If we did that, that wouldn't make any difference.

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But, in this situation, that's not what we're doing.

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We're not saying anything about any individual boy.

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If we did that, the computation wouldn't change.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Rather, we're making this assertion

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
that at least one was born on Tuesday--

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
not about boys, but about pairs.

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And we just don't have very good intuitions

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
about what it means to say something

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
about a pair of people,

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
rather than about an individual person,

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and that's what we did here--

100
00:04:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's why the answer comes out to 13/27.
