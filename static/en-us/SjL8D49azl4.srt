00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,490
Now that you know the various ways to
read and write from Firebase, you might

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,530
have noticed that to update a piece of
data there are a lot of moving parts.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,830
You can call a write
method to update the data,

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,550
then the data's changed
in the Firebase database.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,210
This triggers your listeners
which you've added, and

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,260
finally the UI is updated.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,120
With so much going on, when you're
trying to debug what might be going

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,580
wrong anywhere in this process,
it can be a little tricky.

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,500
So let me tell you about a helpful
method that I've been using to track

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,870
what my code is sending and
receiving from the Firebase database.

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,110
So here I am in my
ShoppingListApplication class.

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,003
If you find like you need to debug your
app you can type the following in.

13
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:43,860
Firebase.getdefaultconfig.setloglevel.l-
ogger.level.debug.

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,210
This turns on Firebase's debug mode.

15
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,160
And in debug mode, you get a printout
of useful data in the logs

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,650
about what is sent to and
received from, from Firebase.

17
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,110
So let's run the app and
see this in action.

18
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,810
With the app up and running,
I can open up the logcat output and

19
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,450
change it from Verbose to Debug.

20
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,040
Okay, so I've cleared the logs.

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,710
I'm going to go ahead and
add a shopping list.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,800
And we can see here that,
in the logs, I actually

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,610
get a lot of information about what
was just set and where it was set.

24
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,300
I made this list called Let's Go
Shopping with an anonymous owner, and

25
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,380
here's the timestamp info.

26
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,790
And here it shows the data
that was being sent through,

27
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,970
you can scroll over a little bit.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,960
And if I go over to my dashboard,

29
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,000
I can see that it has in fact
been sent to the database.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,750
Knowing how to both use
the debug logger level and

31
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,165
to make sure that you keep checking
what's going on in the dashboard,

32
00:01:34,165 --> 00:01:37,600
will help you really make sure that
your app doesn't have any bugs in it.

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,500
So now, whenever you run into a bug,
you can always try turning on the debug

34
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,500
logger level as well as comparing
what's going on in the dashboard.
