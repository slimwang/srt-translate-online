00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,780
With the reduced permissions offered
by the email scope, we get access to

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,820
the Account API but we're forbidden
access to the stuff in People API.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,460
That's were we got the bug
that we had earlier on.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,030
Now the Account API offers
the following methods,

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,740
getAccountName, clearDefaultAccount,
and revokeAccessAndDisconnect.

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,390
You've used two of these already
in building your application.

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,860
Can you figure out where
you actually used them?

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,120
Enter the name of the method
where you used them here.
