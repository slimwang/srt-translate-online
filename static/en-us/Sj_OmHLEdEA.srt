1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, so for your first homework, what I'd like you to do is get a basic web app online.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is going to be the foundation for what we're doing in the rest of this class.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So step 1 will be install Google App Engine.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We'll include documentation in the course notes for how to do this,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and you can also use Google's own instructions online.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And we want to install the Python version.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Put online a basic app. All it has to do is print out the words, "Hello, Udacity!"

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Nothing fancy.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Just basically get this thing online, and when you've got that working,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
submit the URL here.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll show you what it looks like on my browser, or my version of it.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Here we are. This is what I've installed.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You can see it's running on appspot.com, which is Google App Engine's domain by default.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
All it does is has a simple webpage that prints out, Hello, Udacity!

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is the entire homework. If you get this working, you have succeeded.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
For some of you, this should only take 15 minutes or so,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
but I realize that installing web apps and packages and things like this

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
can sometimes be troublesome.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So once we've got this working, we'll have a good foundation to build on

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
for the rest of the course. Okay, good luck!
