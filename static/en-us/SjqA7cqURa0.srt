1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,200
We're going to use this quiz question
actually to reinforce the idea that

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,420
mandatory access control applies
in nonmilitary setting as well.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,670
So hospital is found to be lax.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,310
Unfortunately, there
are examples like these that you

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,920
read about in the newspapers
almost on a regular basis.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,580
So they were lax in securing access to
patient records and they have a breach.

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,370
And a breach means basically
someone who's not authorized to

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,380
access those records is able to do that
or is able to gain access to them.

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,630
That's not a good thing.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,380
So the hospital has violated
some kind of a policy.

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,050
And that policy, really, we talked
about in healthcare regulation,

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,410
is what requires that you handle
data with care or in a certain way.

13
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:50,120
So this quiz question basically is what
policy may the company have violated?

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,460
And there are two options.

15
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,810
Think about each one of those and
then we'll discuss the answers.
