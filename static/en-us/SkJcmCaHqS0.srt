00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,470
Here's a real example of a poly
alphabetic substitution cipher.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,110
It is called the Vigenere cipher.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,400
Vigenere cipher has a clever way
of representing possible mappings

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,800
from one letter to another as a matrix.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,500
Here we encrypt the plaintext by
processing one letter at a time

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,360
across the columns.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,600
We use the letters in a key to tell
us which row to look at the mapping.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,210
Now suppose we have a plain text, and

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,390
the first three letters are A-T-T,
and we have a key.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,350
In effect, the key stream should
be as long as the plaintext.

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,040
So this will be lemon,
lemon, lemon, and go on.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,250
Here, the first three letters
of the key stream are L-E-M.

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,060
Now let's see how we can encrypt
the plaintext according to the key.

14
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,430
We encrypt the plaintext by
processing the letters one at a time

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,970
across the columns.

16
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:59,220
The first letter is A,
so we look at column A.

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:05,470
We use the letter in the key, L to look
at the row to decide the mapping of A.

18
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:11,500
Here the mapping says L, which means
in server text, A has been mapped to L.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,400
The next plaintext letter is T.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,510
So we look at column T and

21
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,500
we use the letter in the key to look
at the row to decide the mapping.

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,220
The letter is E in the key.

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,800
And so we look at column T and row E.

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,340
And the mapping is X.

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,940
This means that the cipher
text of T is X.

26
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,700
The next plaintext letter is T again.

27
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:42,200
So look at column T again, but
here the letter in the key is M,

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,940
so we look at column M, and
the mapping of column T, row M, is F.

29
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:53,810
This means that the cipher text of
plain text T is F, therefore for

30
00:01:53,810 --> 00:02:00,315
plain text A-T-T and key L-E-M,
the corresponding cipher text is L-X-F.
