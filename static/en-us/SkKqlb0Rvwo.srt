00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,680
Before we get started, you may have noticed these cute,

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,290
wooden blocks on my desk.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,641
They belong to my daughter, but I'm borrowing them for this course.

4
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:12,475
And during each lesson, I will illustrate some more complex concepts related to

5
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:17,930
operating systems using a metaphor that's based on toys and a toy shop example.

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,950
To give you a high-level idea of how this will work, we will think of

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,632
the hardware in computer system as the toy shop with its tools and

8
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:26,960
work spaces and storage areas.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,360
Then we will think of all of the processes and applications that execute on

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,730
hardware as all of the toys that are being produced in the toy shop.

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,199
And then central to this course will be that we will drawing be

12
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:40,360
analogies between operating systems and

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,510
the toy shop manager that oversees everything that's happening in the toy shop.

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,590
This will become much clearer in the following classes.

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,450
For now, this concludes the introduction.

16
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,830
I sincerely hope you will enjoy this class.

17
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,670
Good luck and have fun.
