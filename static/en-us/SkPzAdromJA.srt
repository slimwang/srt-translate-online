00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,310
This course is meant to tell the stories our genomes hold for us,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,700
both known and unknown. Now, depending on

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,260
your perspective this can mean different things.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,900
>> The lessons here will cover what genomes are and how they work.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,470
We'll learn how genetic information changes over time, and how it's passed down.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,400
>> We'll learn about how some traits

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,900
are controlled by few genes and other traits

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,660
are controlled by many genes. Genes. Ultimately,

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,170
we'll see how we can use genetics to

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,240
trace our past and see how we're all

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,280
connected, all the while, we'll be getting first hand

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,729
accounts about certain traits and learning about the

13
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,550
social implications of knowing the genetic information underlying them.

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,170
By the end of this course, you'll have

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,870
a solid grasp of genetic information. And how it's

16
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,660
organized into a genome and affects a myriad of

17
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,830
traits. So get ready for tales from the genome.
