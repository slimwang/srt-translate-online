00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For your next homework what I'd like you to do is make a signup page

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
that validates a user's input.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It should ask for 4 things--a name, a password, verify the password, and an email address,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which will be optional.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If the user submits something that's invalid, it should print out an error message,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and if it is valid, it should redirect to a welcome page.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'll give you a demo of this now.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Here's my signup page. It's running at this URL.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If I were to type in a valid username and passwords and an email

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and click submit, watch the URL.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We get redirected to Welcome--username equals spez--

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
where it prints out Welcome, spez!

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now a couple things that this should do.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If you don't enter a username and you submit, we should get an error message.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Likewise, if we don't enter a password, you should get an error message.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If we submit an invalid username--this one's invalid because it has a space in it,

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and I'll include in the notes what a valid username is--

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
we should still get an error message.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If I include 2 passwords that do not match, I'll also get an error message.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now notice that when we included an invalid username, we kept the username in the form,

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
but when we included an invalid password, we blanked the passwords.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That is intentional.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The email address is optional.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I can type in 2 matching passwords. I can make this a valid username.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
When I submit this form, it says Welcome.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay, all is well.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
If I type in an invalid email address, and I'll include for you what makes an email address

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
valid for our purposes, we should get an error message on that field as well.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's not a valid email.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Be sure to read the notes, and when you've got this all working,

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
please enter the URL here. Good luck!
