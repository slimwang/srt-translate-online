00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,939
Since around 2005 malware has been used
to control compromised computers and

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:10,990
networks to perform malicious activities
that often lead to elicit financial and

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,130
even geopolitical gains.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,960
In other words, whereas computers in the
past were merely targets of malware for

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,540
fun, they are now resources that malware
can take control of for profits and

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,750
gains.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,545
Since modern malware are now used to
do real work to achieve profits and

8
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:31,760
gains, they tend to be
technically sophisticated and

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,070
utilize the latest technologies.

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,000
For example, they have utilized
popular peer to peer protocols and

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,290
applications to set up communications.

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,520
And they've used cloud computer servers
to support their activities, and they

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,240
have used the latest crypto algorithms
to perform authentication and encryption

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,300
to protect their communications
from subversion and analysis.
