1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,450
So now that we're logged
in to our cloud shell,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:06,050
let's take a look at how we manage
applications without Docker.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,528
We'll kick this off by creating a Ubuntu
VM to play around using the gcloud

4
00:00:09,528 --> 00:00:11,280
compute instances create command.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,080
Once our VM is created, we"ll log in
using the gcloud compute ssh command.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,852
On our VM, let's use our native
package manager to install NGINX and

7
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:24,090
all of its dependencies.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,560
First we'll have to make sure
everything is up to date on our system.

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,090
Now, with our system up to date, we're
going to install the NGINX web server.

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,470
And let's check the NGINX version.

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,240
Let's use systemd to start the NGINX
based on what we did previously.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,640
Now I need to check that
the NGINX is actually running.

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,600
One way to do that is with
the systemctl command.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,860
So I see that everything's
actually running.

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,990
I see the logs are telling
me everything looks right.

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,950
So now I should be able to hit
NGINX locally, using curl.

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,853
This is great.

18
00:00:56,853 --> 00:01:00,999
So modern OSs make it really easy
to install applications, start, and

19
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:01,630
run them.
