00:00:00,154 --> 00:00:05,020
Hi, my name is Patrick Nussbaumer, and
I'll be your instructor for this course.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,640
I work for Alteryx, a leader in
self-service data analytics, and

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,470
I've worked with data acquisition and
analysis for over 20 years.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,560
Imagine that you work
at a large bank and

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,684
you're contemplating changing operating
hours at all of your bank branches.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,830
You're not sure if the change will
lead to better performance and

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,520
want to run an experiment to determine
if you should proceed or not.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,490
It would be great if you could change
the hours at a few branches and

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,830
then base your decision on all branches
on the limited data that you gathered.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,392
This is exactly the type of scenario
that is a perfect fit for AB testing.

11
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:43,875
Using AB testing methodologies, you
can design an experiment where you can

12
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:48,569
determine if the performance of a group
of branches with the modified hours have

13
00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:52,970
statistically significant results
over the control branches.

14
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,900
And you can use this information
to guide your business decision.

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,339
In this course, we'll learn how
to set up and analyze AB tests.

16
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:05,004
AB testing is a type of experiment
with two variants, A and B,

17
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:09,750
which are the control and
variation in a controlled experiment.

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,140
You can use AB testing to
help solve business problems

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,710
when you don't have enough data
to use modeling techniques.

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,224
The two types of experiments that
will be discussed in this course

21
00:01:20,224 --> 00:01:23,780
are randomized design and
matched pair design.

22
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,380
The first lesson in this course will
walk you through the fundamentals of

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,040
experimental design, then we'll
cover the two types of AB tests.

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,220
Lesson two will focus on
randomized designs and

25
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,590
lesson three will focus
on matched pair designs.

26
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,920
We'll then build upon what we've
learned in lesson four and

27
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,240
address a slightly more
complicated business problem.

28
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,530
To get started with experimental design,
let's introduce a business problem that

29
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,670
we'll reference throughout the course to
give some context to the terminology and

30
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,599
processes that you'll learn.

31
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,070
You've recently become the brand
manager for a large candy manufacturer.

32
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,930
The product development team
has been hard at work coming

33
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,820
up with a new line of products for
your brand.

34
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,759
As this is a new product and the company
is unsure if it will be successful or

35
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,550
not, you're being asked to
predict the effect on sales

36
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,190
if the new product is introduced so

37
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,800
management can determine if the product
should go into full distribution.

38
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,100
In this situation, we have no past
information to help us build a model and

39
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,590
predict what will happen in the future.

40
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,530
Being in this data-poor situation, we
have only one course of action to help

41
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,210
us with our business problem,
set up an experiment.
