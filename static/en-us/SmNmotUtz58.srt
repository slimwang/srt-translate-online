1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,780
So, there are a lot of
open source systems for

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,840
different aspects of monitoring.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,640
This is a really vast subject, so
we can't really cover all of it.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,210
Couple of important points, one you

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,800
won't be able to monitor every aspect
of your system with only a single tool.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,740
That's okay.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,050
Pick a couple.

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,420
It's important though that whatever
monitoring systems you pick be

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,930
generally accessible within
your organization so

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,580
that other people can
learn from them as well.

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,060
One of the most flexible
approaches to monitoring

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,600
involves having some kind
of key value data store,

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,380
with a simple API to dump in
whatever values you want to monitor.

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,320
This is the approach favored by
Graphite, InfluxDB, etcetera.

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,460
Then you have various front
ends to visualize the data.

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,390
Graphite offers it's
own web front end for

17
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,310
it's data, Graphite also works well for
a more flexible display.

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,730
And there are a lot
of other systems that

19
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,940
are mentioned in the instructor notes.

20
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,990
Now for the app server you've
been working within this class,

21
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,280
we've provided a Graphite monitoring
server with symmetric setup.

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:02,990
You should check it out.
