1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,299
I'm here with Jarrod Parkes, who is
a course developer here at Udacity.

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:04,553
Thanks so much for
talking with us today Jarrod.

3
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:05,296
>> Absolutley.

4
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:07,605
>> I'm going to talk to
Jarrod today about games, and

5
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:08,960
using games in learning.

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,550
So let me start by asking Jarrod,

7
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,590
what experience do you have
with using games in learning?

8
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,860
Do you have any projects
you've worked on in the past?

9
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,331
>> Yeah before projects,
as a gamer at a young age,

10
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:20,887
a lot of the games that I played were
ones that had like a really strong,

11
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:25,048
I wouldn't necessarily say educational
skew, but they were developed to a point

12
00:00:25,048 --> 00:00:28,275
where they taught some concepts
that I was learning in school.

13
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:31,762
And I was like hey, I'm learning
the same things playing games as I

14
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:34,451
am in class, and
I felt that effectiveness there.

15
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:39,396
But in terms of projects, yes I've
worked on a couple projects that used

16
00:00:39,396 --> 00:00:43,840
game engines to teach science and
biology specifically.

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,210
And those seem to reach a certain
group of students pretty effectively.

18
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:47,980
>> Very interesting.

19
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,494
So when you're talking about using game
engines for that, is it building a game

20
00:00:51,494 --> 00:00:54,222
for it, or is it just kind of
using the physics simulation, or

21
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:56,333
something like that for
the learning process?

22
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,697
>> It's more using the physics engines,
and

23
00:00:58,697 --> 00:01:02,048
the other different components
that game engines have, and

24
00:01:02,048 --> 00:01:05,529
presenting something that looks and
feels like a video game but

25
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:09,160
in terms of maybe game logic, or
other types of game objectives.

26
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,510
Those may not necessarily exist.

27
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,570
There's different ways
to I guess classify.

28
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,640
You also have technology.

29
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,100
There are apps that
are using game technology,

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,560
that are more like gamified learning.

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,020
As opposed to something that's more of
like a full in depth 3D experience,

32
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,130
where maybe you're walking around in
an environment that is historically

33
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,440
relevant and doesn't exist today.

34
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,322
And you're seeing it and experiencing
it, as opposed to something that's kind

35
00:01:38,322 --> 00:01:43,160
of like quiz games, or something like
a brain game trivia style type stuff.

36
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,890
>> So, talking about a spectrum that
runs from, giving students badges or

37
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,540
achievements for

38
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,560
completing the kind of work they
probably would have been doing anyway.

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,500
All the way to building kind of these
more robust, exploratory environments,

40
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,930
where students can actually experience
playing with some real system.

41
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,710
>> Right, and systems and
also things that are telling stories.

42
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,600
For me history was the thing that
really I learned through games.

43
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,070
A lot like you might learn through
movies, or other media where you're able

44
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:16,010
to portray something in a interesting
way in something that's engaging.

45
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,160
>> So do you think that kind of
teaching approach is inherently better,

46
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,200
is it always better, are there
certain fields it works better in?

47
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,170
>> I think it's better for
certain cases,

48
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,340
I don't think it is the all in one
solution, it's not the silver bullet.

49
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,090
But for certain mediums,

50
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,420
that maybe classically aren't
interesting in a classroom setting

51
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,670
I think it's great to explore ways to
bring in game tech to make learning fun.

52
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,870
>> Yeah.
Does it apply to everybody or

53
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,240
does it appeal to everybody, or
do we need to be aware sometimes

54
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,550
of the type of audience we're reaching
with some of those interventions?

55
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,960
>> I think you have to be very aware.

56
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,250
I think for certain students,
you can approach them with

57
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,540
some learning application that's
using game technology, and

58
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,730
they would tell you
themselves that they love it.

59
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,620
And to those students I say,
let's give them more of what they like.

60
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,040
For the students that
you're not engaging,

61
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,110
I think you take an alternate route.

62
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,500
>> So, is the main purpose of
that approach engagement, or

63
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,040
is there something more to it?

64
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,120
Is it to get them interested?

65
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,490
Or, is there some fundamental learning
that's easier to do through this kind

66
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,491
of arrangement?

67
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:18,525
>> I think for
things that are visually based,

68
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:23,855
they're hard to conceptualize on
a whiteboard, or just extract from text,

69
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:29,032
than things that are in a video game
setting using physics or other things.

70
00:03:29,032 --> 00:03:33,008
Yeah it would probably be easier
to teach in a game way, for

71
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:35,047
certain things no, though.

72
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:39,108
Math maybe not, that's I think
the chalkboard has been an effective

73
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:41,278
way of teaching math for a long time,

74
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:45,844
but I think some of those things where
you get to say games are getting better.

75
00:03:45,844 --> 00:03:47,737
Engines are getting better in
terms of what they can do and

76
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:49,020
what they can simulate.

77
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,100
>> And I agree,
I think that when we're designing games,

78
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,210
there's an authenticity there we really
need to pay attention to that when

79
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,060
we're able to use those engines to
create an authentic experience,

80
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,070
then the learning kind of follows that.

81
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,960
That it might be more engaging sure but,

82
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,870
even if it's not inherently
more engaging if it can build

83
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,200
a closer experience with whatever that
system we're going to explore is.

84
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,640
That's the old better.

85
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,620
So what are the new coming horizons?

86
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,839
What are the new frontiers in using
games in educational environments?

87
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,300
>> I think there's a lot of interesting
things that are being re-thought

88
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,340
about and rehashed in computer AI.

89
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,460
Oh man.

90
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,480
Systems that respond more
intelligently and more realistic, and

91
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,810
those types of things, I think, will
be more prominent in the coming years.

92
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,650
I know there's a lot of
research being done there.

93
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,370
And I'm happy and excited to see
how that's going to translate from

94
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,620
something that's maybe purely academic
to something that's more in games.

95
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,425
>> One of my favorite topics that, it's
covered a good bit here at Georgia Tech

96
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:51,456
is game AI for story telling,
for narrative story telling,

97
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:54,964
because it creates a kind of nice
experience where not only students,

98
00:04:54,964 --> 00:04:56,530
in human history for example.

99
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,050
Not only are we putting them in
a environment where they can

100
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,140
look around and see what it looked
in some historical time period, but

101
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,910
we might actually be able to create
a world that they can interact with.

102
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,000
And, that actually has
the kinds of stories and

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,010
kinds of experiences we want to teach
them, as something they can just find,

104
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,280
and just emerges out of some
system that they interact with.

105
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,220
So it's very personal to them but it's
also very authentic to whatever system

106
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,580
we're, or
whatever time period we're exploring.

107
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,330
>> Yeah.
>> So for

108
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,240
any of our students who want to use
games for teaching, do you have any tips

109
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,624
on things they should be aware of,
things that they should look in to?

110
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:31,400
>> Yeah, I think it's important
to start with an idea, and that

111
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,850
idea needs to be something, that maybe
the motivation isn't games at first.

112
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:43,520
And really sit down and think about
is how I'm using this game technology

113
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,110
an effective mechanism,
as opposed to something else.

114
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,810
Don't just go, I like games,

115
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,200
let's figure out how to take what I've
learned in classroom and make it a game.

116
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,290
It should be approached with
a little bit more caution.

117
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,557
>> And I agree, I think that there's
some theory about motivation that says

118
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:01,658
that when we kind of gamify
the traditional educational experience,

119
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:04,200
we actually risk hurting it,
especially down the road.

120
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,640
So I agree with you that I think,

121
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,890
what we really need to pay attention to
when we're building educational games is

122
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,980
building the game out of the authentic
portions of the material,

123
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,890
as opposed to just attaching a game
onto what students are doing anyway.

124
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,500
>> Right, consumers of games and
of technology in general can see when

125
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,040
something feels cheap, and
if the experience feels cheap I

126
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,770
think you're going to lose more students
then the ones you're going to help.

127
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,260
>> Great.
Well thank you so much Jarrod for

128
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,150
talking to us today.

129
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,720
>> Absolutely.

130
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,620
>> And thanks you all for watching.
