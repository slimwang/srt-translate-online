1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,530
Oracle, one of the largest
database vendors,

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,128
actually sponsored
a database security survey.

3
00:00:07,128 --> 00:00:11,857
I think it was 2014, to basically
ask people in various companies,

4
00:00:11,857 --> 00:00:16,600
organizations, about threats to data
that is stored in the databases.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,729
And they list the number of threats
that they're worried about, and

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:24,716
this question is actually about,
what are some of these threats,

7
00:00:24,716 --> 00:00:27,795
which are the most serious or
the biggest threats?

8
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:31,245
The two options I have here
are external hackers, and

9
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:34,245
the second was insider and
unauthorized users.
