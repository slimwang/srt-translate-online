00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,320
Our solutions are negative 3 plus the square root of 2, or negative 3 minus the

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,060
square root of 2. Nice work for finding those two answers. We start by taking

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,252
the square root of both sides of our equation. So we'll have x plus 3 on the

4
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:18,607
left equal to plus or minus root 2 on the right. Then to isolate x or to solve

5
00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:22,885
for x, we'll subtract 3 from both sides to get x is equal to negative 3 plus or

6
00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:25,563
minus root 2.
