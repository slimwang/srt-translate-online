00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,522
The answer is 5 over 2. Let's say I want to start at this point right here, the

2
00:00:05,534 --> 00:00:11,206
point 0,1. I can find another point that lies on this line that's easy to pick

3
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:16,915
out, like this one right here, point 2,6 and figure out that we count over one,

4
00:00:16,927 --> 00:00:22,114
two, to the right, and then up from there, one, two, three, four, five. So we

5
00:00:22,126 --> 00:00:26,508
take five and divide it by two and that gives us the slope. We can also see that

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,468
if we wanted to step over one to the right, we would need to step up 2 and a

7
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:34,445
half units to be back on the line and 2 and a half is equivalent to 5 halves.
