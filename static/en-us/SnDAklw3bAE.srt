1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,624
So we'll need to save the name of the country as well as the country's

2
00:00:02,624 --> 00:00:06,498
population. We'll initialize largest country name with the first country that

3
00:00:06,498 --> 00:00:09,474
we look at, sort of the way we initialized largest population with just the

4
00:00:09,474 --> 00:00:14,210
population that we looked at. Now when we find something which has a population

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,546
larger than the largest population. We'll need to update the largest country

6
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:22,449
name as well as the largest population. Now, when our program gets to the end,

7
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:25,989
where we print things out, it'll still have access to the largest and the

8
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:31,826
largest country name, but it's only printing out the population. So I'll add a

9
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:35,661
line, print the country with the largest population is and the variable where

10
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:40,230
we saved the largest country's name. When it asks for a file, I'll find the

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:46,194
population file. And I get that the country with the largest population is

12
00:00:46,194 --> 00:00:51,160
Afghanistan at 3.0419E7. That seems pretty funny to me. I don't think of

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,080
Afghanistan as a very big country. Let's look at these numbers. Afghanistan has

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,445
eight digits. But Bangladesh has nine. Clearly there's something wrong with the

15
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:05,464
program. It looks like it's set the largest population and the largest

16
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:11,360
population name the first time, but then after that, probably didn't update it.

17
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,203
So there must be something wrong with my loop. Oh! It's looking for a double

18
00:01:16,203 --> 00:01:18,869
first, but the format of the file has the name of the country first, and then

19
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,630
something that could be read as a double. So this should actually just be,

20
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,510
hasNext not hasNextDouble. Let's try this again. Okay. Now I'm getting that the

21
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,910
country with the largest population is China, with this as it's population.

22
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,119
That seems much more reasonable.
