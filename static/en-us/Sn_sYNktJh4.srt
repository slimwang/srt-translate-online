1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,495
And the answer is no. This is a really great reason, and a really great thing

2
00:00:03,495 --> 00:00:07,160
to think about. If 6x minus 2 were a factor, then we could rewrite this

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,656
expression as follows. We could write it as 6x minus 2 times a bunch of other

4
00:00:11,656 --> 00:00:16,556
things. But then, that would mean that we could rewrite it as 2 times 3x minus

5
00:00:16,556 --> 00:00:21,728
1, times a bunch of other things. Since this expression is not divisible by 2,

6
00:00:21,728 --> 00:00:24,968
or in other words, since we can't pull factor of 2 out of every single term

7
00:00:24,968 --> 00:00:29,363
here, that means 6x minus 2 can't be a factor of f of x.
