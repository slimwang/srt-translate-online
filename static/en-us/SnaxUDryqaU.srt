1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay. Another difference is, in this class, we've been talking about SQL

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and in the app store, we've got something a little different.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's called "G-quel"--GQL

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and it's basically a simplified version of SQL

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that works only in the Datastore.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And the main difference is

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
all queries begin with SELECT*

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
so there's no way to select individual columns--

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So this actually simplifies a lot of queries we can do.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
For example, we can't do joins,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
which is why I didn't want to spend a whole lot of

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
time on joins earlier.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Even if I were working in a SQL database,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I probably wouldn't be doing a whole lot of joins

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and in the App Engine Datastore,

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
we won't be doing any joins whatsoever because it's not possible.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
When we're using GQL--

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
actually, we don't even have to use GQL at all.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The Datastore has a kind of procedural language you could use as well.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But since we've spent all this time practicing SQL

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and you'll probably use it elsewhere in your career,

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
we're going to use GQL for this example.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So we can at least have some consistency there.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Another difference is in a kind of generic

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
SQL database, as we've been talking about.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You can run arbitrary queries--

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
no matter how slow, with or without indices.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And in App Engine, all queries must be indexed.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is important, right--because

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
when you're running your own database, you can do whatever you want.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But Google--it's very nice of them to give us this whole system for free--

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
at least for small-use cases--

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
but we can't beat their machines to death.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
All the queries must be indexed.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's actually not just so we don't beat them to death

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
but it's just the way the whole system is built.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
As you get more familiar with it, it'll kind of make sense--

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
why things are designed the way they are.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So for the most part, in this example

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
that I'm going to build and your homework,

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
you won't actually have to build any indices yourself.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Google App Engine will actually build the indices for you,

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
which is really handy.

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If you wanted control over what indices they build--

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
yes, you can do that yourself.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Sometimes, it might build, not the most efficient index,

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and you can define your own--so that's pretty cool as well.
