1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And, not surprisingly, the answer is

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
all of those companies and many, many, many more

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
use massive machine learning for making decisions

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
that are really essential to the businesses.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Google mines the web and uses machine learning for translation,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
as we've seen in the introductory level. Netflix has used

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
machine learning extensively for understanding what type of DVD to recommend to you next.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Amazon composes its entire product pages using

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
machine learning by understanding how customers

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
respond to different compositions and placements of their products,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and many, many other examples exist.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I would argue that in Silicon Valley,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
at least half the companies dealing with customers and online products

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
do extensively use machine learning,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so it makes machine learning a really exciting discipline.
