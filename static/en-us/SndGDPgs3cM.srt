00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,788
Through of the constant term from being on the right-hand side to being on the

2
00:00:03,788 --> 00:00:07,315
left-hand side, we usually need to add 3 to both sides. This gives us an

3
00:00:07,315 --> 00:00:11,996
equation of y plus 3 equals x squared. So, in other words, if you want to shift

4
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:17,216
to the problem y equals x squared down by 3 units, we just need to replace y

5
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:18,266
with y plus 3.
