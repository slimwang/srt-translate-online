00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,203
In the previous lesson, we learned about the words and, and or and intersections

2
00:00:04,215 --> 00:00:08,307
and unions. And was for an intersection and or was for a union. We're going to

3
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:12,402
use this knowledge for compound inequalities. Let's see how these ideas play

4
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:16,597
out. For a compound inequality, we don't just have one inequality, we have two.

5
00:00:16,692 --> 00:00:20,792
Between each compound inequality, we'll have the word and or, or. This one has

6
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:25,173
and. So, for this first skills check, I want you to solve each inequality and

7
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:29,208
write your answer in these boxes. Then, we're going to look at how to diagram

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:29,929
the solution.
