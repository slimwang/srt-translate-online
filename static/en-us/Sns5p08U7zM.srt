00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,730
So now, we know that everything we think and do happens because of nerve cells.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,264
As it turns out, nerve cells are not alone. There are actually two main types

3
00:00:08,264 --> 00:00:12,766
of cells in the central nervous system. The glial cells and the neurons, or the

4
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:19,070
nerve cells. The glial cells, as seen here, provide structural support. They

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,247
support the efficient communication between neurons. In addition, they also

6
00:00:23,247 --> 00:00:28,643
help my removing cellular debris. Glial actually means glue in Greek. It helps

7
00:00:28,643 --> 00:00:32,508
to hold the central nervous system together. The glial cells also help form the

8
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:36,810
blood-brain barrier, and play a role in the control of breathing. The neurons

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,682
are cells that process and transmit information in the nervous system. They

10
00:00:41,682 --> 00:00:44,898
receive information, they integrate that information, and then they generate

11
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:50,281
messages. There are approximately ten billion neurons in the human brain. And

12
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:53,336
even though they're located very close together, most of them don't actually

13
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:59,225
touch. Each neuron has about ten thousand connections to other neurons. Which

14
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:03,470
allows for literally trillions and trillions of neural connections. This makes

15
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,710
the brain one of the most complex structures we know.
