00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,080
I'm going to use the find method again. I need to find the

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,060
index of the person I want to move. In this example it would

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,120
be four. Then I need to remove them from that spot, so

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,100
that I won't have two copies of that person in the list. And

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,850
then the induces would change accordingly. Then once I've removed them, then

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,330
I want to add them at the front. I'm going to use add

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,390
instead of set, because I don't wipe to away the zeroth one,

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,430
I just want to move everybody down. So now this will be zero,

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:31,470
this will be one, two, three, four, five. In BlueJ that would look like,

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,610
get the Old Index, by finding the Person. And then if that Person is already

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,779
a friend we remove them from their old position and insert them into the

12
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:42,930
zeroth spot. If they're not already a friend, then we don't have to do anything.
