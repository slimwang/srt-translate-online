00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,384
To finish solving for x we divide both sides by 3, so x would equal 5. So we

2
00:00:04,384 --> 00:00:08,814
know the x coordinate is 5, but remember we still need to find y. I'm going to

3
00:00:08,814 --> 00:00:13,312
use this first equation to find y. I'm going to plug in or substitute the value

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:17,954
of x, which is 5 into this equation. Negative 2 times 5 is negative 10 and then

5
00:00:17,954 --> 00:00:22,602
I add 10 to both sides of the equation to get y equals negative 1. So this is my

6
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:27,192
solution to the system. And, of course, if we want to know if we're right, we

7
00:00:27,192 --> 00:00:31,965
can check our solution. We'll plug in x equals 5, and y equals negative 1 into

8
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:36,893
both equations, and it should work. And when we check the first equation, we get

9
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:41,838
negative 11 equals negative 11. And when we check the second equation, we get 26

10
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:45,084
is equal to 26. So, yes, this has to be our solution.
