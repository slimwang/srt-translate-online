So in the next few quizzes, I'll be
showing you an action in the app and I

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,789
want you to go ahead and choose which
action on the table, so either create, read

3
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:13,500
update or delete that will need to learn
about, in order to complete action inside

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,980
the app. So for the first one, said I just
open up the app and I see a list of all

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,089
the pets there in the shelter, so in
order to open and see the list of all

6
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,329
the pets in the shelter requires which
of the actions on the table?
