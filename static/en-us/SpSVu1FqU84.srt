1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,340
This is a good time to revisit
our final detail wireframe.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,550
If we're going to store our weather
forecast information in a database

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,270
table, which columns
should our contract have?

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,360
In our database, we will have
a table of weather forecast entries.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,880
We use a row to represent
each forecast day.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,520
And we'll store each piece of data
associated with the forecast in

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,750
a separate column.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,345
Taking a look at our weather UX,
which columns would we need for

9
00:00:26,345 --> 00:00:28,100
the weather database table?

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,830
Think of which columns should
be in each database record.
