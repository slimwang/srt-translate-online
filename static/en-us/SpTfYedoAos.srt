00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,839
Let's take a look at this app across

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,300
a few devices with different width screens, an iPhone

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,980
at 640 pixels across and a nexus 7 tablet

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,230
in landscape, at double that width 1280 and note

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,210
that it rescales properly on both of these

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,940
devices. Note this takes into account orientation as well.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,300
The default scaling is to available screen width, so

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,600
it will properly adjust when you flip the screen.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,960
There's also a height property on viewport which you could

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,590
use instead of width, to control the scaling based on

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,900
the height, but of course, most designs are built as

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,220
width primary. That is, they're designed to scroll up and down.
