1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
And the answers here are that the shortest path from A to B has length 10,

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,950
so, for example here, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,890
and the number of shortest paths from A to B is still 2.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,250
If you start on A, and once you've made the decision to go up here,

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,250
the only way to continue the shortest path is like this,

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,520
because otherwise he would be visiting a city more than once,

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,910
and then the path gets longer than 10 edges.

8
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,600
If, on the other hand, you start out by going down,

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,190
then there is no other way to go along the shortest path than this here.

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,560
So again there's 2 diffferent possibilities of going from A to B

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,250
along the shortest path that visits all vertices,

12
00:00:40,250 --> 99:59:59,999
and the length of that shortest path is 10.
