00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,170
So how will this class work? Because you can do just about

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,290
anything with Salesforce, we spent a lot of time dreaming up the

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,540
different apps you could build. For example, we could've built an app

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,190
to manage airplane parts in a warehouse, or keep track of clients at

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,690
a hotel, or anything else really. But these are everyday use cases

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,700
that just don't excite the imagination. You're going to spend some time on

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,230
this and we wanted you to have fun. So we settled on

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,470
building an app that would let you manage a music festival. If you

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,040
don't know what a music festival is or how

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,500
they work, don't worry. We'll teach you as we go.
