00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,520
Now you'll learn how to run queries to
find conferences that were created by

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,910
a specific user.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,970
Remember that each conference
has an ancestor and

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,800
that ancestor is the profile
entity of the user who created it.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,760
So here's how you create
a query to get all entities

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,600
that have a particular ancestor.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,400
You just add an ancestor argument to
the query with the key being the profile

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,440
of whichever user it
is you're looking for.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,590
This kind of query is
called an ancestor query.

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,900
But you can also think of it as a
descendant query because it lets you get

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,260
all the descendents of
a particular entity or

12
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,660
all the descendants that
match a particular kind.

13
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,080
So for conferences, this will get
all of the conference objects

14
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,100
that were created by a particular user.

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,190
Now you already dealt with the response
classes for conferences, so all you'll

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,020
need to do is define get conferences
created in the conference API.

17
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,400
It doesn't need to accept
anything from the request so

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,310
you can use void message there.

19
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,760
But since this query, query's for

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,260
conferences created by the logged in
user, you need to make sure the user

21
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,890
is logged in, and if not, throw
the endpoints unauthorized exception.

22
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,870
That's your task for this exercise,
define the endpoint,

23
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,480
test it, then deploy and
create some conferences.

24
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,170
The sample code is in lesson four
editions to do three conference.qy.

25
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,130
Once you're done adding
getConferencesCreated to the conference

26
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,120
API, test your code on localhost,
deploy it to appspot,

27
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,980
create several more conferences, and try
querying them, and put your app ID here.
