1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,976
Based on these two examples, maybe you can figure out a pattern. How did we get

2
00:00:04,976 --> 00:00:10,008
this answer from this term and this term? And how did we get this answer from

3
00:00:10,008 --> 00:00:14,662
this term and this term? Using what you see here, write a general rule for

4
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:17,268
finding the quantity of a plus b squared.
