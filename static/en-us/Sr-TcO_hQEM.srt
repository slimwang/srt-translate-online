00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,300
First, can malware disable
a software firewall?

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,310
The answer is yes, because if the
malware gets into the operating system,

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,670
then it would have the privilege to
disable software-based firewalls.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,230
Likewise, a malware can
disable an antivirus checker.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,550
Because if the malware gets in the OS,

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,240
it would have the privilege to
disable the antivirus checker.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,030
Can a malware disable
a hardware firewall?

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:29,450
Typically, no, because malware typically
cannot control hardware settings.

9
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,320
Can firewalls stop pings?

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,090
Pings are ICMP packets, and

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,420
they can be stopped by firewalls
because the firewall can look at the IP

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,510
header and
know that this packet is an ICMP packet.

13
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,040
Second one, packet sniffing.

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,950
Typically, this means that
the attacker has a malware

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,910
in the internal network that passively
records traffic on the internal network.

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,960
And so there's no activity that
can be seen in the firewall unless

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,130
the attacker is sending a huge amount
of decoded traffic out to the Internet.

18
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,142
But typically the attacker would have
a malware performing the analysis of

19
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:05,633
the decoded traffic in
the internal network.

20
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:09,415
And only sends the small amount of
valuable data out to the Internet.

21
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:12,500
So it would be hard for
the firewall to stop this.

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,190
Outbound network traffic.

23
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,250
Yes, the firewall can control outbound
traffic, because firewalls can inspect

24
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,670
and control traffic both inbound and
outbound.
