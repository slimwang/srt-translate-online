1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,730
I actually just started going through
the process of proving this and

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,730
it was an awful lot like stuff
that we've already done,

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,250
in terms of taking bellman equations
minus other bellman equations.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,840
So let me just jump to the punch line.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,270
So if you push the math all the way
through, what you find is that

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,640
all the transitions and
rewards are alpha close to each other,

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,700
then the difference in the values that
you get for following the policy is

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,160
going to be no more than G over one
minus gamma, where G is that alpha.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,780
That error amount, plus a discounted
version of that error amount,

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,430
times the maximum reward that we get for
forever.

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,896
Right, so this is actually
the maximum value that you can get.

12
00:00:39,896 --> 00:00:43,147
If you get the maximum reward over and
over and over again.

13
00:00:43,147 --> 00:00:43,820
>> Okay.

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,933
>> So, this just gives a quantity.

15
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:49,841
And it has some properties
that you'd expect,

16
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:54,923
like the fact that if we estimate
the parameters perfectly and

17
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:59,080
alpha is zero,
then this is zero plus zero.

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,320
And then, this is zero over
one minus gamma, which zero.

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,470
So, the two value functions
are actually identical.

20
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,800
But they fall off from each other.

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,380
So, if this alpha is something not zero,
some slightly bigger than zero,

22
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,130
then these value functions
are going to be off by a bit more.

23
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,400
So ultimately what we're
going to want is, we want to know

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,390
how accurately do we have to
estimate the transition and rewards?

25
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,630
What should alpha be so that the
difference between the value that we get

26
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,540
by running in our simulation of
the model, and the value that we get

27
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,280
running in the actual MDP,
are really small, like epsilon close.

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,950
So I think all we need to do, actually,
is solve for alpha, in terms of epsilon,

29
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:44,320
to be able to see how accurately we need
to do our estimates to make sure that,

30
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,110
ultimately, our values
are going to be close.

31
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,990
>> That makes sense to me.

32
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,155
>> So this is me now solving for Alpha,
and we end up with this expression here,

33
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:56,837
[SOUND] which says that, that we need
to take the epsilon that we want,

34
00:01:56,837 --> 00:02:01,875
how close we want the values to be,
and then transform it in various ways.

35
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:06,182
Actually make it a heck of a lot
smaller, and that gives us how accurate

36
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:10,479
we need the estimate to
the transitions and rewards to be.

37
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,440
So we know that we're going to be
that close in terms of the value.

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,110
>> Sure, that's intuitively obvious,
even to the most casual observer.

39
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,465
>> Well, okay,
you're probably being sarcastic.

40
00:02:19,465 --> 00:02:20,720
[LAUGH]
>> Possibly.

41
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,570
>> So it's maybe not completely obvious
but I, you know, I did algebra here so

42
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,120
it's, it's not,
it's not deep but it's not,

43
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,080
it's not intuitively obvious
why it should have this form.

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,030
In fact, usually, I don't know.

45
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,220
Epsilons are like one over.

46
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,160
Oh, but I guess we're trying
to define a quantity, alpha,

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,730
which is like an epsilon quantity.

48
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,090
So it wouldn't make sense for
it to be a giant number.

49
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,430
It should be a tiny, tiny number.

50
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,530
But, yeah.
No, no, you're right.

51
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,730
It's not completely obvious.

52
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,410
But the point.
The point that I want to make with this

53
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,615
is they're polynomially
related to each other.

54
00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:50,115
>> Mm-hm.
>> Right.

55
00:02:50,115 --> 00:02:52,038
So if we have RMAX, and

56
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:56,070
one over one minus gamma, and one over
epsilon, then the kind of alpha that we

57
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,990
get out is going to be polynomially
related to the other things.

58
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,690
>> Okay.
>> So that's reassuring.

59
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,080
I mean, if you actually work out what
these numbers are, they're pretty scary.

60
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,330
But, you know, we're, we're trying to
not let ourselves be scared of that.

61
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:13,617
The important thing though is that
alpha's not really a parameter of RMAX,

62
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:15,680
the RMAX algorithm.

63
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,480
Right?

64
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,283
What was the parameter that we had
when we talked about the algorithm.

65
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:22,011
>> [FOREIGN]
>> [FOREIGN]

66
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:22,675
>> [LAUGH] [FOREIGN]

67
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:23,995
>> So, that is to say,

68
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,685
what we want is a parameter that
says how many times do we have to

69
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:31,630
try a state action pair,
before we are confident that our

70
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,330
estimate of that transition
probability is better than alpha?

71
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,240
So, how are we going to
get that last piece?

72
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,490
How are we going to turn alpha into C?

73
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,080
>> More algebra?

74
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,320
>> Yeah, but specifically,
there's bounds that come into play here.

75
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,330
So now, we've actually turned
it into the same kind of problem

76
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:51,010
as the bandit problems that
we were talking about, right?

77
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,510
That we need to know, how many times
do we pull a bandit arm before your

78
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,120
estimate in the mean
is sufficiently close?

79
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,380
And that is the Hoeffding bound.

80
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,180
>> Right.

81
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,870
You did say we were going
to use Hoeffding bounds.

82
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,380
>> Yeah, and the union bound.

83
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,090
>> Oh, yeah.

84
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,110
>> We want to simultaneously
make this alpha

85
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,490
close estimate hold across
all state action pairs.

86
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,250
So we need to make the c big enough, so

87
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,730
that the probability that it fails in
any one of them is sufficiently small.

88
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,899
But it really is exactly the same
argument that we did when

89
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,140
we were talking about bandits.

90
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,780
>> Okay.

91
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,540
And, sure.

92
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,580
So, every.

93
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,460
Every state action
pair is like a bandit,

94
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,380
and you have to pull it
a certain number of times.

95
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,530
>> It's like an estimate of an arm,
right, and

96
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,220
we need all the arm estimates
to be accurate if we want

97
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,580
the arm that we eventually
pick to be near the optimal.

98
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,820
>> Right, okay.

99
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,480
No, that makes
>> That, you know?

100
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,250
I can see the analogy.

101
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,230
I can see the metaphor.

102
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,995
I can see the simile.

103
00:04:40,995 --> 00:04:42,060
>> [LAUGH] All right, perfect.

104
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,670
So, okay.

105
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,530
There's one more piece to this story,
and

106
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,220
then I think we're
doing with exploration.

107
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,040
>> Yay,
we'd be done exploring exploration.

108
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,065
That sounded sort of sad.

109
00:04:49,065 --> 00:04:50,084
>> [SOUND]
