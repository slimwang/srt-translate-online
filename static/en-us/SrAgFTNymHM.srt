00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,720
Visuospatial reasoning is reasoning with visuospatial knowledge.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,060
This has two parts to it, visual and spatial. Visual deals with the what part.

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,880
Spatial deals with the where part. So imagine a picture in

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,590
which there is a sun on the top right of the picture. There are two parts to it.

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,840
Sun, the what, the object. And where, the top right of the picture.

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,330
We have come across visuospatial reasoning a little bit when we use

7
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,840
constraint propagation to do line labeling and 2D images. One way of defining

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,360
visuospatial knowledge is to say that in visuospatial knowledge causality is,

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,460
at most, implicit. Imagine a picture in which there is a cup with

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,290
a pool of water around it. You don't know where the pool of water came from.

11
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,400
But you and I can quickly infer that the cup must have contained the water, and

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,340
the water must have spilled out as the cup fell. So visuospatial knowledge,

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,270
causality is implicit when it enables inferences about causality.
