00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,154
The answer, of course, is simply the number of elements in the stencil,right?

2
00:00:03,154 --> 00:00:08,475
So every element in that array is going to be read 5 times by the 2D von Neumann stencil

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:12,017
because there are 5 entries in the neighborhood.

4
00:00:12,017 --> 00:00:17,002
So, all elements will be read 5 times by the 2D von Neumann stencil,

5
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:22,460
9 times by the 2D Moore stencil, and seven times by the 3D von Neumann stencil.
