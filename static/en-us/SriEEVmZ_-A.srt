00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,530
Now that we've talked about
3D objects inside of Unity,

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,230
let's talk a little bit
more about materials.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,470
&gt;&gt; Take for example this chair.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,080
Materials are a great way
in Unity to color them.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,850
&gt;&gt; Yep, you could also use
materials to shade objects,

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,920
like that, or texture them as well.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,990
Nice, and without materials, we wouldn't
even be able to see our game objects.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,490
&gt;&gt; That's right, so they're incredibly
important to understand thoroughly.

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,500
So let's dive right in to learning
about materials inside of Unity.
