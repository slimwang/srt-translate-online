1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,040
So our Catalog Activity
is looking pretty good.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,240
So now we want to tackle one of the big
remaining functionalities which is

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,500
implementing the detail screen.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,420
So instead of adding a brand
new activity to your app,

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,870
we can actually go ahead and use our
existing Editor Activity for this.

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:15,986
What's the modifications?

7
00:00:15,986 --> 00:00:21,720
So one way to think of this, is that
the Editor Activity will have two modes.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,710
So the first mode will
be inserting a new pet

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,780
which is triggered when
you press the FAB button.

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,860
So from this mode,
the title will say, Add a Pet and

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,740
the fields will be all blank and

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,360
then pressing the save button will
insert this new pet into our database.

13
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,920
The second mode is an edit mode
where we allow to edit a pet and

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,250
this will be triggered when one of
the pets in list view is clicked on.

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,270
So in this mode, the title will say Edit
Pet and the fields will be pre-populated

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,010
with the existing pet's information and
pressing the Save button here

17
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,530
will update the pet's info instead
of making a brand new pet.

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,210
Now our Insert Mode Is already done.

19
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,489
So that means we just need to add logic
to differentiate between these two modes

20
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,740
and then add code for
the edit-mode function.

21
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,030
So building this out will
require quite a bit of code, but

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,000
let's start off with
a small coding task.

23
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,870
So for this small coding step,
I just want to focus on pressing

24
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,990
one of the list items and
then have it open up the EditorActivity.

25
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,660
In addition, I want it to display
whether the editor is in edit mode or

26
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,040
the insert mode via what's in the title.

27
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,370
Right now, there's no need to
populate these fields just yet,

28
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,200
just changing the title.

29
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,760
So populating these fields will involve
more than just triggering an intent

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,265
that's opens up a new activity
because the intent to do so

31
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:46,900
we'll need to include some data
which shows the fact that the user

32
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,370
has clicked on a list view item.

33
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,980
So to help us eventually build out so
that the edit mode of the editor

34
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,870
activity will eventually show
the information about the existing pet,

35
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:01,160
we can add the URI to
the data field of the intent.

36
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,650
So the URI will contain
the ID of the pet and

37
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,990
we'll pass it along to
the EditorActivity.

38
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,229
And so we can use the data field of
the intent because it's meant for

39
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,700
storing URIs.

40
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,220
So to sum it up, by the end of this
coding step, the user will be able to

41
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,010
press any of the pet list view items and
the URI for that pet will be sent

42
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,230
along in an intent data field to
the editor activity in edit mode.

43
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,860
Now here's how you would implement code.

44
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,440
So first you'll need to add an on item
click lister onto the pet list view.

45
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,470
Now inside of it,

46
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,420
you need to create an instance
of a new on item click listener.

47
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,050
Now remember the reason that
it's thrown an error right now,

48
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,280
is that there's a method that
we still need to implement.

49
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,280
So to help us with that, go ahead and
click on this red light bulb.

50
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,550
Go to implement methods,

51
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,780
and it will pull in the on items click
method that we need to implement.

52
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,052
So go ahead and select that, click OK,

53
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:58,560
and then it pulls in a template
of the method for us.

54
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,130
Now remember on item click is the method
that's triggered when the list view

55
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:03,790
item is clicked on.

56
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,940
So by default,
we're given these parameter names, but

57
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,929
I'm going to change a couple of
them to be more useful to us.

58
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,310
So first we have the adaptor view,
and this is just the listview.

59
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,330
Next is view, which is
the particular view for the item.

60
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,210
Following is integer, which is the
position of the item in the listview.

61
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,190
So let's go ahead and
change this from I to position.

62
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,530
And lastly, is the long parameter.

63
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,230
So long here is the ID of the item and
let's change this from L to ID.

64
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,300
So this parameter will be particularly
useful for us since we'll

65
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,420
be generating the URI for the pet In
order to pass along as an intent extra.

66
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,740
So we'll need this ID to identify
which item we've clicked on.

67
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,490
So here are two hints for accomplishing
this inside the onCreate method.

68
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,220
So once you receive the intent
from the CatalogActivity,

69
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,520
you have to use the getIntent method and

70
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,330
the getData method in order to get
the associated URI from the intent.

71
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,680
Now once we have that information,
you have to set the title of the editor

72
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,790
activity depending on
which situation you have.

73
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,040
So the two situations, remember,
are if the editor activity

74
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,209
were opened from using the list view
item, then we'll have the URI for

75
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,660
the pet, so we should change
the app bar to say Edit Pet.

76
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,980
Otherwise, if we are coming from a new
pet, that means the URI is null, so

77
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,990
the app bar title should
change to Add a Pet.

78
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,790
So given these hints and
the flow of information, go ahead and

79
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,420
complete the quiz.

80
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,130
So for this coding step, I'd like
you to modify the editoractivity so

81
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,580
that it accommodates editing pets.

82
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,470
So to do so, add the functionality so

83
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,500
that when you press a list item view
from the catalog activity, it, 1,,

84
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,450
opens up an Editor Activity,
2, has a title of Edit Pet and

85
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:59,080
then 3, passes the selected Pet's URI
by setting the data of the intent.

86
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,380
As a hint, remember you can always
log the URI in the log statement

87
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,730
in order to test if the URI
was passed along correctly.
