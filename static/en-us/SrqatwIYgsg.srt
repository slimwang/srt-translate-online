00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,158
Social networks have been around as long as

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:04,548
there’ve been people forming communities but the

3
00:00:04,548 --> 00:00:06,997
modern study of social networks is different because

4
00:00:06,997 --> 00:00:09,583
it’s now possible to put together social networks that

5
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:12,381
include data on millions of people. Now that’s more

6
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:14,469
than any one individual could possibly hope to

7
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:17,015
understand in detail. Unit four explores the notion of

8
00:00:17,015 --> 00:00:19,515
statistics, numbers that summarize complex

9
00:00:19,515 --> 00:00:22,099
structures like social networks. We’re going to take a

10
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:24,599
look at how we can compute statistics quickly, so we

11
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:26,391
can get a handle on the biggest social networks

12
00:00:26,391 --> 00:00:30,000
around. Here we go.
