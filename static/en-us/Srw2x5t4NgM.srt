00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Norvig] What is the one test I have here?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
First I've defined 3 hands.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
sf stands for a straight flush, fk stands for 4 of a kind,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and fh stands for full house.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I've defined those by taking this string, splitting the string up on the spaces,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and so that will give me a list of 5 cards for each of these 3 possible hands.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And then I've asserted that when we play a game of poker between these 3 hands

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that the winning hand is the straight flush.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The whole idea of having tests like this is a vital part of software development.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's important that each part of the specification gets turned into a piece of code

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that implements it and a test that tests it.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So here we have only 1 test.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is a test that tests part of the implementation of the poker function.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If you don't have tests like these, then you don't know when you're done,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and you won't know if you've done it right,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and you won't have confidence that any future changes might not be breaking something.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So remember, to be a good programmer, you must be a good tester.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Write your test cases and test them often.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I want you to add 2 more tests:

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:22,000
1 test that will test whether the winner between 4 of a kind and full house is correct--

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and so what should that be? It should be 4 of a kind--

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and another test that seems a little bit more trivial

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
but testing if we have 2 copies of full house playing each other

24
00:01:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that full house indeed is the winner out of those 2.
