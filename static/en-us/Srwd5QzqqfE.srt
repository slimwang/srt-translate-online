I think with pseudocode you always need examples. Here's some pseudocode. We'll

2
00:00:05,127 --> 00:00:15,442
have two items with prices 1 and 10 and we'll set the cost initially to 0. Tax

3
00:00:15,442 --> 00:00:23,731
is the item price times 0.08. The tip is the item price times 0.18. And I'll

4
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:29,160
set the cost to whatever it was before plus the item price, the tax, and the

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,489
tip. And print the cost. What should this print? And when might you use this

6
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:38,174
process?
