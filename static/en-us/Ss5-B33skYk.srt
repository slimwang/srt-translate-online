1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,400
One last thing about
background subtraction.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,470
These days there are special
kinds of cameras,

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,870
that instead of just giving us an RGB
value, they give us, RGB and D, depth.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,399
So you're familiar with the, the
Microsoft Kinect, because unless you're

5
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:17,084
living under a rock,
you know about the Microsoft Kinect.

6
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:21,471
That's not a rock as in a Iran,
it's a rock as in granite.

7
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:27,786
So anyway RGB-D cameras, you can
then do background in depth, right?

8
00:00:27,786 --> 00:00:31,630
So you take an image,
and the depth is fixed.

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,884
That is, the lights might turn on and

10
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:39,380
off, the sun might cause a shadow to
move by, but the background is fixed.

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,240
So, so in, in terms of its,
it's geometry.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,760
So you can actually do background
subtraction in terms of geometry.

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,780
So you subtract on the d channel, and

14
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,541
that's pretty cool and,
and very powerful.
