00:00:00,382 --> 00:00:04,782
[SOUND] Learning about all those
e-commerce steps was a bit complicated.

2
00:00:04,782 --> 00:00:06,952
Now let's do something a little easier.

3
00:00:06,952 --> 00:00:09,270
Let's time something
that happens in the app.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,550
You can send hits to Analytics
to record timing information.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,990
To be clear,
Analytics won't do the timing for you.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,310
You need to write
the timing code yourself.

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,830
Once you've recorded the timing,
you can set that in hit to Analytics.

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,764
The easiest way to time things is
to record the timestamp before and

9
00:00:31,764 --> 00:00:35,003
the timestamp after
the things you want to time.

10
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:39,871
And you can use System.nanoTime to
record elapsed time between the start

11
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:43,110
and the stop time in nanoseconds.

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,780
So to send a timing hit to Analytics,
use TimingBuilder

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:53,680
to build the hit and set the value
to be the time that you recorded.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,610
The other parameters are the same as for

15
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,320
the events that you've
already sent hits for.

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,260
There's the category, the value,
the label, the variable.

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,244
It's important to put
the time value as the value.

18
00:01:05,244 --> 00:01:09,125
Now you may find that the developer
documentation says that some of

19
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,938
the parameters are optional.

20
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:15,680
But I found that the hits didn't show up
unless I supplied all the parameters.

21
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,922
To see the timed values in
the Google Analytics Dashboard,

22
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:24,360
you go to Behavior > App Speed.

23
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,300
And here you see I had some
sessions with timing hits.

24
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,300
And I timed how long it took to list all
the dinners, and it was really fast.

25
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,960
Now it's your turn to add
timing hits to your app.

26
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,260
Go ahead and
add the code to time how long it takes

27
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,760
to display the list of dinners and
then enter that value here.

28
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,770
And we want the value as
reported from Google Analytics.

29
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,869
No fair popping up
a toast to get the data.
