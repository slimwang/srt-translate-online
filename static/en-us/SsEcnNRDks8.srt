1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,050
If an error occurs here in this line,

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,190
then the next reject function
will get called, which is here.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,720
So once again the first number is 1.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,460
Then the recovery function happens,
and things get back on track.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,610
So, the next number is 3.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,250
After that, there's no more
log in here so that's it.

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,020
Next step.

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,390
If there is an error with this recovery
function, now this is an interesting

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,930
one, because this is only going to
get called if there is another error.

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,470
So in this case nothing
will show up in the log.

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,385
And then for this one, if something
goes wrong with the async function,

12
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:37,195
then this next reject
function will get called.

13
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:40,495
In that case, the number 4
should end up on the screen.

14
00:00:40,495 --> 00:00:43,415
So, these can be kind of tricky,
but just keep in mind that if

15
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:46,515
something goes wrong, the next
reject function will get called.
