00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,420
If you watched the solution video, you would have noticed that I

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,380
used two different methods for transforming our variable. The first method used

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,450
a wrapper right around the variable, and then the second used a

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,130
scaling layer. Let's look at the differences between these two plots and

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,560
see what the two adjustments really do. I'm going to save this first

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,700
plot into log scale and I'm going to save the second plot into

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,660
count scale. I'm going to use each of these variables and pass it

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,950
to grid.arrange, so that way I can plot them side by side, and

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,730
that's why the ncal is equal to two. Running this code,

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,680
we can see that we get our two histograms. When looking

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,240
at the two plots, we can see that the difference is

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,742
really in the x axis labeling. Using scale_x_log10 will label the axis

13
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:42,750
in actual friend_counts. Whereas using the log10 wrapper will label the

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,640
x axis in log units. This is just something to keep

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,380
in mind as you make more plots. In general, I think

16
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,208
it's easier to think about actual counts, so that's why I prefer

17
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:54,020
using the scale_x_log10 as a layer. Now, this does

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,540
mean that you'll need to learn the ggplot syntax, but

19
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,605
don't worry, you'll have plenty of practice in lesson

20
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:01,480
four, and if you're feeling really adventurous, you can add

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,780
a layer to any of the plots that you

22
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,010
create. So, take our original histogram for friend count. Let's

23
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,319
just add scale_x_log10 to it, and there you go. You

24
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:13,163
have it, the new histogram transformed using log base 10.
