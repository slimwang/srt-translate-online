1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,150
I started teaching myself how to
program around the age of 12, and

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,970
quickly fell in love with web
development, specifically.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,910
I got my first freelancing gig in 1996,

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,740
so I've survived quite a lot of
changes as the web has evolved.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,270
As developers we're learning
pretty difficult concepts and

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,580
solving hard problems all the time.

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,190
The best was to accomplish
this is to get into the zone,

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,830
where time just flies by and you're
highly engaged in what you're doing.

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,550
To get to that point, you have to
be comfortable in your environment.

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,780
From keyboard shortcuts and
color schemes to window positions.

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,540
When I'm working on a new project or
learning something new,

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,050
I always place my windows in
the exact same position on-screen.

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,600
My editor taking up the left half.

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,310
A browser taking up the right half.

15
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,690
And my terminal, up and running, so

16
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,370
I can easily get to it
with a keyboard shortcut.

17
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,170
>> Even experienced programmers
are constantly learning new things.

18
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,780
As Mike explained, setting up your
workspace for success is key.

19
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,630
Next, we'll give you some tips and

20
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,790
walk you through how to set up
your own personal workspace.

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,250
To start we'll make sure Python is
installed properly on your computer.
