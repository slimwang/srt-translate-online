00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,149
So welcome to Sunday of
your Firebase weekend.

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,929
Yesterday we learned all about
the Firebase Realtime Database, and

3
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:09,019
we set up Friendly Chat to send and

4
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:11,469
receive messages that were
stored in the database.

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,740
>> Right, right, and we talked about
security rules for the database.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,859
And then we set up authentication
to control who can access messaging

7
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:19,739
in the Friendly Chat app, right?

8
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:22,279
So right now we have
an app that can send and

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,070
receive messages, which really is
amazing for just a day's work.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,429
>> Yeah, it really is.

11
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:31,500
And today, we're just going to add some
more features to enhance Friendly Chat.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,625
We'll look at some things
such as Firebase Storage.

13
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,546
And we'll use this to
store photo messages, so

14
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:38,333
we're not just sending
text to each other.

15
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:40,300
And we'll make Friendly Chat
that much better.

16
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:41,759
>> That sounds great actually.

17
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,989
Then next we're going to examine
the security roles for Firebase Storage.

18
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:45,200
>> Okay.

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,520
>> Right?

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,170
And then finally,

21
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,170
we're going to round out the weekend
by adding some other Firebase features.

22
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,079
Let's do analytics, notifications,
and how about remote config?

23
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:57,039
>> That's a lot, but
I know we can do it.

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,229
So let's dive in.

25
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:58,379
>> Cool.
