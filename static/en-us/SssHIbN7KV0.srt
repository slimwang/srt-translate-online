1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,990
Now we talked about the need for

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,450
labels when you want to talk about MAC,
or multi-level security.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,670
And we even said, well, user has
a certain label, file has another label.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,940
And we have to say, we have to check,
if user with this label L1,

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,580
should he or she be able to access
the document that has label L2?

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,940
So we have to sort of
compare these labels.

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,990
So here, we're going to explore
how that comparison might work.

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:34,040
So let's just talk about labels of the
type that we discussed in the context

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,100
of the military intelligence community
and how they access information.

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,350
So, sensitivity, how sensitive data is.

11
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,910
We said that, we had those circles,
top-secret is the most sensitive,

12
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,990
secret, next level,
then classified, and unclassified.

13
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,220
We had restricted in the middle there,

14
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,410
but I'm just picking
these four examples.

15
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,290
So what does this greater than mean?

16
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:04,470
So we are saying that, these levels
are actually ordered totally.

17
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,050
And by total order, what we mean here
is that if I pick any two of these,

18
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,720
I can tell you which one is more
sensitive than the other one.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,520
So TS is the most sensitive.

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,140
If you took TS and
any other of these levels,

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,500
then we know that this is higher, or
is greater than, the other level.

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,990
Similarly, secret is greater,
or higher, than classified.

23
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,430
So this greater really means it's
higher level of sensitivity.

24
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,390
And total order basically means,
when you pick any pair so

25
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,130
the relations and various kind of
orders that you can define for

26
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:41,880
the elements that are in a given set,
that's where it defines a relation.

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,750
So the total here means you pick
any two elements of this set,

28
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,650
and there is an order between them, so

29
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,490
one is always going to be more
sensitive than the other one.

30
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,590
Here we see that through this greater
than sign, symbol that we have.

31
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,810
We do know that labels have a level,
sensitivity level.

32
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,880
But they also have a compartment.

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,630
And we said compartments are sort of
sets of different topics or categories.

34
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,711
And how do you compare sets?

35
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:13,080
You take set S1 and S2.

36
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,140
S1 may be contained in S2,
S2 may be contained in S1, or

37
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,750
neither set may be
contained in the other one.

38
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,170
So if set S1 has some
elements that S2 doesn't, and

39
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,930
vice versa, then neither set
will be contained in the other.

40
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,750
So when you have sets, the way you
compare them is containment, or

41
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,090
subset, or
is one a subset of another one?

42
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,460
And we know that that
order is a partial order.

43
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,510
So total order is when,
pick any two, and

44
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,050
one always is greater than or
higher than the other.

45
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,280
When you talk about sets,
we know there are going to be

46
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,750
pairs of sets where neither
one contains the other one,

47
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,690
and they're not going to be ordered,
so that's called partial order.

48
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,215
So we'll explore this a little
bit more through examples.

49
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:03,510
But if a label is going to have two
parts, one part is totally ordered,

50
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,080
one part is ordered sometimes and
not comparable at other times, so

51
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,390
that's the partial order.

52
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,260
So when we talk about actually ordering
labels, we had to look into the label.

53
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,820
We have to look into
the sensitivity level.

54
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,240
What are the sensitivity levels?

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,428
If the labels that we're comparing is
L1 and L2, then we are to look at L1's

56
00:03:24,428 --> 00:03:29,160
sensitivity level and L2's sensitivity
level and how they compare.

57
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,260
And then we're going to look at the
compartment of each one of those, and

58
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,130
then compare those compartments.

59
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,320
And by comparing both parts,

60
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,740
then we going to be able to
decide how to order the labels.
