1
00:00:00,187 --> 00:00:02,858
So let’s follow our Jersey Square team down

2
00:00:02,858 --> 00:00:05,163
and see what they’ve done for customer

3
00:00:05,163 --> 00:00:07,290
relationships. We’ll it’s really interesting to

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,124
remember when they first started. Customer

5
00:00:10,124 --> 00:00:13,506
relationships for then said search ads, social

6
00:00:13,506 --> 00:00:15,671
medium and stadium promotions. And there

7
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:18,703
was nothing wrong with that. But really

8
00:00:18,703 --> 00:00:21,288
what they discovered is that they were actually

9
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:24,390
just talking about the customer acquisition

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,656
portion, or the get portion of customer

11
00:00:27,656 --> 00:00:30,776
relationships. But we really want teams to

12
00:00:30,776 --> 00:00:33,472
understand, what you can do to keep customers

13
00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:35,245
long-term, and what are you going to do

14
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:37,999
to grow them in the next couple of years as we.

15
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:40,168
So we ask you to think about get, keep

16
00:00:40,168 --> 00:00:42,268
and grow. And they did a good job of

17
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:44,645
getting out of the building and doing that.
