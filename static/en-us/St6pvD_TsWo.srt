1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,260
Remember how I told you that your editor
is like that steak knife that was

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,510
built to fulfill a specific purpose?

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,490
Well, that wasn't the entire truth.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,390
It's true that most editors have figured
out how to do a great job with basic

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,860
editing, but almost all modern editors
can be extended with functionality.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,840
In Sublime's case,

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,760
all of it comes from a healthy
community of developers, like you.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,920
They were missing something and
built it.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,300
And indeed, right now your
Sublime is a genetic text editor.

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,509
It doesn't care about you
being a web developer.

11
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:29,107
In the next step you customize
it with the help of James, so

12
00:00:29,107 --> 00:00:31,190
it becomes a front-end
development editor.

13
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,240
>> Sublime doesn't have a built
in plug in repository, so

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,000
the first thing we'll need to
do is install package control.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,655
Its the only time we'll manually
need to install a plugin.

16
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:46,360
We'll take this scary looking
block of text from the notes and

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,060
paste it into Sublime's terminal.

18
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,780
And with that it's fetching the plug in
and installing all of the dependencies.

19
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,770
Let's test whether it worked.

20
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,820
Type Command+Shift+P to bring
up Sublime's command palette.

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,660
This drop down menu is
useful in many ways.

22
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,760
Because it contains all
the actions Sublime can do.

23
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,000
I generally use it to discover
stuff I didn't know about,

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,730
like this toggle comment action and

25
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:19,070
to execute actions that don't have
shortcuts or have crazy long ones.

26
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,370
But right now, type in P-A-C,

27
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,980
and you'll see many new commands
associated with package control.

28
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,270
The one we really care
about is install package.

29
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,775
This one right here.

30
00:01:30,775 --> 00:01:34,705
This is the list of all of
the packages in the repository.

31
00:01:34,705 --> 00:01:38,195
So now that we're prepared, let's
install a few of our favorite plugins.

32
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:45,100
This list of plugins is also in the
notes for you to quickly copy and paste.

33
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,850
Through package controls and
stall command, please install Emmet,

34
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,000
Sidebar Enhancements,
Color Picker and Color Highlighter.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,600
Some plugins require
restarting the editor.

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,590
So to make sure to do that after
you have installed everything.

37
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:05,205
Emmet dramatically extends and improves
Sublime's built in text snippets.

38
00:02:05,205 --> 00:02:09,550
Its craziest feature is the ability
to use CSS selectors to create new

39
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,930
HTML markup.

40
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,890
I know that sounds a bit confusing,
but let me tell you what I mean.

41
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,450
Let's say I need a list with four
items in my index.html file.

42
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,240
I can do that by typing
the CS selector shown here.

43
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,689
Then pressing Tab expands the selector
into the HTML we specify.

44
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,510
Emmet comes with a lot
more built in magic

45
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,890
that you should definitely check out
in the link in the instructor's notes.

46
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,760
The Sidebar Enhancements plugin has
a pretty descriptive and spot on name.

47
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,960
It mostly extends the right-click
menu of Sublime's

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,830
usually pretty bare-bones sidebar with
all of the stuff you would expect.

49
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,890
Deleting files, new folders and so on.

50
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,690
But also, some nifty stuff such
as copying content as a data URI.

51
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,920
Now, these last two,
Color Picker and Color Highlighter

52
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,642
work together to make editing and
working with colors in CSS, much easier.

53
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:08,090
Pressing Cmd+Shift+C opens
the system color picker and

54
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,760
allows you to quickly choose a color.

55
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,610
And when the cursor is placed in or

56
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,770
around an existing color,
picking a new one will update it.

57
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,678
The highlighter outlines or
underlines colors it finds in your

58
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:24,960
CSS with a preview so you always
have an idea what you're looking at.
