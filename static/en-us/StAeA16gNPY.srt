1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And the goal of all this is to actually

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
define the customer persona or archetype,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which is just a fancy way for saying

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I want you to know everything about those customers.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What could be everything?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
At the end of the day, not only do you know about the pains and gains

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
of these customers, but you specifically know who they are.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If they're in a company their position and title, their age, their sex, their role.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Consumers could be parent. They could be child.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
For a consumer it could be housemate, et cetera.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
How do they buy? Where do they buy?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
How much money do they have discretionary to spend?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And again, it's true in companies, and it's true for consumers.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In companies do you know how much each individual department can sign off for?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That is, if you've priced your product $1 too high,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
sometimes it requires the next level of management to sign off.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Same at home.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you're trying to sell to kids, do you know what their allowances are

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and where they get their money and how often they get it?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And if you're selling to consumers who are parents

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
what's their weekly spend on discretionary items?

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You need to understand what matters to them, what motivates them,

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
who influences them, and this one isn't trivial.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The influences them, you're going to go back to this

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
when you do customer relationships later,

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and it would be great if you actually knew how to reach these people

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and what buttons to push when you do.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And so if you start asking these questions when you're starting to talk to them,

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
trying to define them, it makes spending for marketing and demand creation,

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
that is, for customer acquisition and activation,

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
incredibly easy because you already asked them up front

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
how would I get you to buy this?

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So marketing doesn't become some mysterious process later on.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Customers already told you "Oh, this is how I buy, and this is how much I spend,

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and here is who I listen to when I want to make a purchase."

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
As I said earlier, to me the goal is actually for you to know enough

37
00:01:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to confidently go up to a white board and draw the day in the life of a customer.
