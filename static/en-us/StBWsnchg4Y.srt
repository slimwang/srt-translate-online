00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,485
Shifting up or moving in the positive y-direction, means replacing y with y

2
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:08,850
minus k. This goes along with the same reasoning that we used for the shift

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,725
downward. We just need an opposite sign here to indicate the opposite direction

4
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:14,400
of motion.
