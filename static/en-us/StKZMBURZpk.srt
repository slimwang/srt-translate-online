1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,170
Okay.
It's time to finish the project.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,400
If you want to follow
along with my solution,

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,180
you can download a copy of my source
code in the downloadable section.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,840
I started by creating
new crops of the images.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,280
Some of the images were fine, but for

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,600
most of them, I went with different
crops for different browser widths.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,050
For instance, with the horses
on medium sized displays,

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,369
I zoomed in just a little bit.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,460
And then on small displays,
I zoomed in quite a bit.

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,330
Now, you can actually see the horses.

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,235
Back in the HTML,

12
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:33,650
your picture element has two types
of children, source and image.

13
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,070
Source is optional but image is not.

14
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,480
The image here acts like a fallback,
meaning,

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,880
that if none of the sources get hit,
the images will be displayed.

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,390
Also for

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,510
browsers that don't support picture,
the image will be displayed by default.

18
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,310
For each image,
I set two sources alongside the image,

19
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,740
the first source has a media query
of min width 750 pixels, and

20
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,530
the second has a media
query of 500 pixels.

21
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,520
For each image, I set two
sources alongside the image tag.

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,800
The first source has a media query
of min-width 750 pixels, and

23
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,150
the second has a media query
of min-width 500 pixels.

24
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,360
This means that for any browser with
a view port greater than 750 pixels,

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,350
the images in this source
stack will be shown.

26
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,410
If the browser has a view port
width greater than 500 pixels, but

27
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,580
not greater than 750.

28
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,330
This source tag will be shown.

29
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,440
And then, for any others,
the last image tag will be shown.

30
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,660
Which means that, basically,

31
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,560
any browser smaller than 500
pixels will be seeing this image.

32
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,270
For the first source, I decided to take
advantage of the source set attribute.

33
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,070
Source set allows you to change
which image is displayed,

34
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,610
based on a device pixel ratio.

35
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,220
So for a 2x display, I am showing a 2x
image which is at 1600 pixels wide.

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,200
But for 1x displays I am
just showing a 1x image.

37
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,090
And 1x is default,
it doesn't need to come at the end

38
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,770
with the picture element set up like so
the browser is being told to decide

39
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,960
which image to download based on its
width and its device pixel ratio.

40
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,570
This is really awesome because
you know that the browser is

41
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,470
only going to download the image
that meets its needs perfectly.

42
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,889
Talk about responsible.

43
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,920
And hey, all of this still works within
the figure tag that I was using before,

44
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,820
so here's a figure caption because,
why not.

45
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,230
And, of course, I made sure to
set all of my alt attributes.

46
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,740
The only image that didn't
get an alt attribute is

47
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,640
the SVG logo at the top because it
doesn't really mean anything here.

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,580
So, how does all this look?

49
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,845
I'll go ahead and test.

50
00:02:30,845 --> 00:02:32,735
First things first, I'll test whether or

51
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,775
not these images are changing
based on browser width.

52
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:38,395
So here's the large image of the horses.

53
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:42,945
At less than 750 pixels, I see a much
tighter crop of them, which looks good.

54
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:45,835
And then,
once the browser drops below 500 pixels,

55
00:02:45,835 --> 00:02:48,245
there's the tightest crop of the horses.

56
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:50,590
So it looks like the picture
element is working.

57
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,930
To test whether or not SourceSet
is working, I've gone ahead and

58
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,170
refreshed the page while
emulating an iPad.

59
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,540
With a width of 1,024 pixels and
a device pixel ratio of 1,

60
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,380
you would expect that only 1 x
images are being downloaded.

61
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,010
In fact, that's what you see.

62
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,090
Check out how in the network tab,
only 1 x images are being downloaded.

63
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,710
As a test, I'll change
the device pixel ratio to 2 and

64
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,730
hit Refresh and check it out.

65
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,070
2x images are being downloaded.

66
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,510
That's a pretty clear sign that
the picture element is working awesome.

67
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,340
And then, for the fun of it,

68
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,300
I can even emulate what the experience
would be like on mobile.

69
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,020
I set the network throttling to 3G,
and hit Refresh.

70
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,650
And it looks like the page loads
in just under four seconds,

71
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,450
which all things
considered isn't too bad.

72
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,650
And then, and so, wallah.

73
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,260
There's the blog.

74
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,744
I made a few other changes like
making the top image a full image.

75
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:42,890
And you can check out those changes
if you check out the source code

76
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,960
in the downloadable section.
