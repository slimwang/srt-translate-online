1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,050
Now remember,
we started off by saying we want

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,530
2D transformations where we
basically have a matrix M

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,020
to give us values of any point
p to give a point p prime.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,900
Let's look at what we would do to
get something simple as translation.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,750
So what we want to do for
translation is of course,

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,680
we would have the axis for x and y.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,690
And we want to translate it into
a different location again from this and

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,750
x and y, so this has been translated.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:32,840
Let's say for a lack of better
words by an amount, tx and ty.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,610
Okay?

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,750
How we represent this in this new
homogenous coordinate system?

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:44,610
Well, again, this is what we interested
in x, y prime, x prime, y prime, 1.

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,670
X, y and of course,
now let's think about what M would be.

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,532
By just looking at this, you notice
that we can actually construct it.

15
00:00:50,532 --> 00:00:55,710
Diagonal terms are all 1's, and these,
these two axis could just be tx and ty.

16
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,220
And if you actually do the math,
you'll basically notice

17
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,393
that what we will come up with
would be is x prime is going

18
00:01:06,393 --> 00:01:12,030
to be equal to x plus tx and
y prime would be equal to y plus ty.

19
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,560
That gives us what we wanted.

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,200
So translation is easily
modelled this way.

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,560
What about scale?

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,970
Again, here, the goal is to go from
this image, to a larger image.

23
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:25,830
In this case, again,

24
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,830
what we did before, the same two by two
we had looked at before, with sx and sy,

25
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,470
can go into these two values here, and,
of course, the rest of it will work out,

26
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:39,670
because what will happen is x prime
times sx, x would be the result.

27
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,550
And that's exactly we want.

28
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,620
So this gives me a nice
three by three matrix for

29
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,930
being able to doing things like scaling.

30
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,330
What about rotation?

31
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,980
In rotation, basically I want to take an
image and being able to kind of rotate

32
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,630
it around where basically how I
need to know things like theta.

33
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,340
And here the theta would
be this value here.

34
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,100
All right.

35
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,170
And we know how to do this.

36
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,805
Again, we know when if, somebody
gave me a theta, I can compute using

37
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:09,699
this cosine theta minus sine theta,
just in this two by two.

38
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,190
And again, these are 0, 0, 1.

39
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,520
What gives me x prime, y prime.

40
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,930
And we know how to do this too.

41
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,050
The good thing with homogenous
coordinate system is,

42
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,910
these two parameters help us do
things like model translations.

43
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,840
We can also do shear the same way.

44
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,590
Start with an image.

45
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,410
We want to shear it.

46
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,970
Remember, this was when
shear happened like this.

47
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,030
And of course again, we would put
the shears in the off diagonal terms.

48
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,760
All the diagonals would be run.

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,450
You can play around with this yourself
in these matrix multiplies and

50
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,500
you'll see it works.
