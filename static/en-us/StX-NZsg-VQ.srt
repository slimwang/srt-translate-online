00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,142
This time we have to start from scratch. Plugging in 400 for d, in our equation

2
00:00:04,142 --> 00:00:08,534
N of d, 4 times the square root of 400 gives us 80, so it looks like he's going

3
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:14,748
to make 80 glass swipers. Now, this output access the input to our second

4
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:20,102
function for R. R of 80 is just 15 times 80, that gives us 1200, which means

5
00:00:20,102 --> 00:00:24,206
that Grant will make $1,200 in revenue.
