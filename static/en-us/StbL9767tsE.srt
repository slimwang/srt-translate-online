1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,230
On Windows, I'll open the Command Prompt and cd to the Downloads folder.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:10,130
And this time I want to use FC to compare game_old.js to game_new.js.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,478
So I'll scroll back up to the top, and I can see that I'm comparing the files,

4
00:00:14,478 --> 00:00:17,170
game_old.js and game_new.js.

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,680
And there's a, a few different changes here.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,110
So I'll have to look through for

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:26,320
a little bit, but if I scroll down, here's the typo, spacr.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,980
That's not right.

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,320
On Mac or Linux, the process is very similar.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,520
I'll open the terminal, cd to the Downloads folder,

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,730
then run the command diff -u game_old.js game_new.js.

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,060
The diff is in a slightly different format than when I ran this on Windows, but

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,390
the content is the same.

14
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,630
If I scroll back up here's the typo.

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,190
I'll go ahead and open the game.js file.

16
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,820
Search for spacr, and here it is.

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,460
I'll change it back to space now.

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,260
Now I'll go ahead and try out the new controls.

19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,519
I can move now, but it's harder to play the game since I only have two hands,

20
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,280
because Enter is a bit far from the arrow keys.

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,610
I think I'll change the controls back.

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,340
Now I'm going to hand you over to Sara to reflect on what you just accomplished.
