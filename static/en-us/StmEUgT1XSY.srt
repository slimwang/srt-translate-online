1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,820
And the answer is positive, and I prove it to you.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,228
Suppose you put one cluster center right between those two points over here and

3
00:00:07,228 --> 00:00:09,110
the other two somewhere in here.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,380
It doesn't even have an error.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,520
In your assignment step, you will find that pretty much everything left of

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,330
this line would be allocated to the left cluster center.

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,262
And as a result,

8
00:00:21,262 --> 00:00:25,142
this is the point where the total rubber band distance is minimized.

9
00:00:25,142 --> 00:00:27,410
So this cluster is very stable.

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,400
These two guys over here,

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,500
however, separate between themselves the data on the right.

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,350
And they will fight for the same data points and

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,920
end up somewhere partitioning the cloud on the right side.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,456
And that is a stable solution because in the assignment step, nothing changes.

15
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:47,350
This guy will still correspond to all the guys over here, and

16
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,380
these guys will correspond to the guys over here.

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,498
That's called a local minimum.

18
00:00:51,498 --> 00:00:54,960
And it really depends on the initialization of the cluster centers.

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,710
If you had chosen these three cluster centers as your initial guesses,

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,600
you would never move away from it.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,300
Thus, make sure it's really important in clustering to be aware of

22
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,200
the fact it's a local hill climbing algorithm.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,600
And it can give you suboptimal solutions that, if you divide them again,

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,520
it gives you a better solution.

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,110
Obviously, in this case with three cluster centers,

26
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,250
you want them over here, over here and just one on the right side over here.
