1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now we'll have a couple of quizzes to see that you understand Cipher Feedback Mode.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The first question is, how does one decrypt a message encrypted

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
using Cyper Feedback Mode?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here are the choices.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The first choice is we have to go through the blocks backwards,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
XORing out the cipher text from the results of encrypting the X values,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we can compute the X values in reverse order like this.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The other choice is we do the decryption going forward,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
XORing out the cipher text with encrypted Xi values and updating them

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
as we did in the encryption mode.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
A third choice is the same as the second choice except instead of using

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
the encryption function, we're using the decryption function,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which is the inverse of the encryption function.
