1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,100
So, in this question, I'm showing you three processes,

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,400
P1, P2 and P3. And these are the events

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,590
that you can see happening in these three processes.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,420
And, what I want you to do is to

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,820
derive a total order and in deriving the total

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,020
order, we're going to use Process ID to break the

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,930
tie. And smaller the Process ID, the higher the

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:25,480
priority. In other words, P1 dominates P2 dominates P3.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,870
So, using that, go ahead and derive a total order for this

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,130
set of events that I'm showing you happening in the distributed system.
