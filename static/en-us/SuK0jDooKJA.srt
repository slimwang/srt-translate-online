00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,480
As you might imagine, with an important
area such as image loading,

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,450
there are actually a large number
of libraries providing this

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,490
exact functionality,
each a little bit different.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,730
Comparing similar libraries can
be a laborious process, but

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,730
can really give you a deep understanding
of how the libraries work.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,030
For Sunshine, we'll use Glide, the image
loading library that is flexible and

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,570
has a number of optimizations to
allow it to work efficiently within

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,330
a scrolling list and work alongside
the activity and fragment life cycles.

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,180
It is used in a number of Google Apps,

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,930
including Google Camera, Photos,
Field Trip, and the Google I/O app.

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,440
With an easy Getting Started guide,
good documentation, and

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,020
the full source code,
there's a lot to like.

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,660
Let's see how we can use Glide for
Sunshine.
