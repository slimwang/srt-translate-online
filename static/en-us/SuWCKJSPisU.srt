Loren on the other hand again uses emotion focus coping. And one way she can

2
00:00:05,435 --> 00:00:09,822
use this technique is through reappraisal. Here, Loren looks at the situation

3
00:00:09,822 --> 00:00:14,382
again in a new light. Being an avid scuba diver, she remembers the information

4
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:17,892
that her scuba instructor gave her, and that let her reappraise the stressful

5
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:23,594
situation. If Loren checks the tide tables, she could actually time her dive to

6
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:26,780
the changing tides and have a better dive if she gets in the water an hour

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,770
before high tide. This is great news for Lauren. So, now the negative emotions

8
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,730
have been replaced with positive ones. Excitement for the awesome dive.
