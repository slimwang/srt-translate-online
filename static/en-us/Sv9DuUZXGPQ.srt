00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,990
Okay, it's time for quick quiz.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,460
Which of these are built-in variables?

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,350
Does Android detect what language
you use for voice searches, and

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,090
make that available as a built-in
variable in Tag Manager?

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,675
Is the language the device is set to
available as a built-in variable?

6
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:17,945
What about the user's location,
or their email?

7
00:00:17,945 --> 00:00:19,165
What about the SDK version?

8
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:21,915
And, that would be
the Android SDK version.

00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:23,465
Name of the application?

00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:25,565
Is there a random number
built-in variable?

11
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:28,045
And, is there a built-in variable for
food preference?

12
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:30,165
You know the drill.
