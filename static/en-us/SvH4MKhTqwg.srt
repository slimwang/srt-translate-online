1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,080
Let's start by looking
at the Firebase site.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,950
Sometimes UI's for websites change so
if anything seems out of place,

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,510
check out the instructor nodes for
the most up to date information.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,870
We're going to create a free account,
so let's first see what's included.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,700
As you can see here, the free account
gives you a good amount of included

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:24,470
storage, unlimited users and
some static hosting.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,270
That last part might be useful
later on if you ever want to

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,280
make a web app in addition
to your mobile app.

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,430
Now to create a free account.

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,330
Click on Sign Up, and
enter an email address and password.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,300
Once you're account is created you
are redirected to your account page.

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,090
This page shows you all
of your apps in Firebase.

13
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,640
But what is an app in Firebase?

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,090
In Firebase,
an app refers to a Firebase app backend.

15
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,920
This backend includes a database and
support for authenticating users and

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,160
tracking if they're logged in.

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,321
But, for shopping list plus plus,

18
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:02,230
we also have our client
code which runs on Android.

19
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,239
So to be clear as we continue through
the course, here's what we mean.

20
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,580
When we say your app, we're referring
to the shopping list plus plus app

21
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,890
you'll be helping me create in Android.

22
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,180
When we talk about your app's backend,

23
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,310
we're referring to one of these
online Firebase app backends.

24
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,010
So now,

25
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,780
looking at your account page, you will
see the card titled My First App.

26
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,650
This is a starter Firebase
app backend available

27
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,870
when a user creates a new account.

28
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,880
If you're just playing
around with Firebase,

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,380
this is where you'd go to
explore the functionality.

30
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,140
However, for our purposes we are going
to make a new Firebase app backend for

31
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,730
our shopping list plus plus app.

32
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,770
First click on the gray card
to the left of My First App.

33
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,980
You'll need to name your new app.

34
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,780
I will go ahead and
type mine in the app name field.

35
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,840
Notice that the app URL is populated
with the base URL for his app.

36
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,100
Every app has a base
URL associated with it.

37
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,010
And this URL is where you'll go when
you want to access or edit your data.

38
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,050
URLs must be unique.

39
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,750
So now, since I've just taken that URL,

40
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,320
you'll need to use something
a little bit different.

41
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,320
You could use any name that
is 20 characters or less.

42
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,480
Containing alpha numeric characters and
hyphens.

43
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,370
For example, you could name your app
like I did, shop list plus plus hyphen,

44
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,430
and your initials or
something else if you prefer.

45
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,740
Select create new app.

46
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,660
You should now see a card for
your Firebase app backend here.

47
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,700
Click on the URL, or

48
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,230
manage app button and you'll be
taken to your Firebase app backend.

49
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,520
Notice how the URL is
what we originally typed.

50
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,410
As long as you're logged into your
account you can go to this URL

51
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,280
to get a view of what's
going on with your data.

52
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,240
Right now there's not a lot going on.

53
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,080
Your entire database is equal to null.

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,540
Now we could manually
type some data in here.

55
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,818
But instead, let's start with making
a new Android app, hooking it up to this

56
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:07,920
Firebase app backend, and writing
your first data from the Android app.

57
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,750
I'm getting ahead of myself
a little bit, though.

58
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,950
I'll give you a moment to
make an account now, and

59
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:17,280
when you're done, copy and
paste your app's root URL here.

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,460
The root URL is just
the base URL of your app.

61
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,070
You will need this for

62
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,760
the next step, when we hook up
the Android app to the Firebase.

63
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,930
So paste or type your URL here.
