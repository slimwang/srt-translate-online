1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,969
So to quickly summarize, talked a lot
about how we can extract shapes,

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,669
structure, geometry, range and
depth from a variety of methods.

3
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:11,140
Specifically, talked
about stereo imaging and

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,973
also how do you compute depth or
disparity from a stereo image pair.

5
00:00:15,973 --> 00:00:17,541
A lot of information exists.

6
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,716
I just put one paper for you to look at
in terms of what can be done with image

7
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:22,517
based rendering types of things.

8
00:00:22,517 --> 00:00:25,782
That the Szeliski book has
a lot of information stereo.

9
00:00:25,782 --> 00:00:27,547
There's a whole chapter dedicated to it.

10
00:00:27,547 --> 00:00:30,696
If you really get more interested
in 3D computer vision,

11
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:34,641
the most classic textbook in this
area is by Hartley and Zisserman.

12
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:38,415
While dated, it still has
the most foundational methods for

13
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:42,271
trying to reconstruction or
geometry construction from images.

14
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:45,182
Just to finish up, of course,
there are, you know,

15
00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:48,696
lots of nice stereo cameras
available in the market these days.

16
00:00:48,696 --> 00:00:50,560
Here's the one that I have.

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,893
Basically, if you notice
it has two cameras and

18
00:00:53,893 --> 00:00:57,498
basically can be used
to generate 3D images.

19
00:00:57,498 --> 00:01:01,896
And have,
you know can show you this one actually.

20
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:03,881
I just took a picture of
the scene that I am at.

21
00:01:03,881 --> 00:01:05,959
I don't know if you can see
this when I rotate this around.

22
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:09,577
But it should show you that this
basically has also got a display that

23
00:01:09,577 --> 00:01:10,859
shows the scene in 3D.

24
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:14,990
Again I'm going to let you folks spend a
little bit of time learning about these

25
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,260
types of cameras and stuff like that.

26
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,904
There are some cameras.

27
00:01:18,904 --> 00:01:21,677
And of course,
there's a long history of 3D cameras,

28
00:01:21,677 --> 00:01:23,218
even with film are coming out.

29
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:26,302
And there are these days,
of course, game devices and

30
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:28,918
a lot of cell phones that
have multiple cameras

31
00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:32,825
that could be used to generate 3D
images by just doing stereo pairs.

32
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:37,147
Here is actually just using this camera,
I took the images left and

33
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:38,998
right pair of Daniel and

34
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:43,342
they can be used in this instance
to generate anaglyph image here.

35
00:01:43,342 --> 00:01:46,393
There are lots of other different types
of ways you can display 3D images

36
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:46,901
like this.

37
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:51,060
For more information, please look at
some of the other sites and thank you.
