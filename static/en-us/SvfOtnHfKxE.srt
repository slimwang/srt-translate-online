00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,145
It turns out that it would only take 15 minutes. Nice algebra skills if you got

2
00:00:05,145 --> 00:00:09,534
that one correct. We know in the first case, we're driving for 20 minutes at 45

3
00:00:09,534 --> 00:00:15,254
miles per hour. So 20 minutes would be time 1, and 45 miles per hour would be

4
00:00:15,254 --> 00:00:18,891
rate 1. We're looking for how long it takes for the car to travel the same

5
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:23,970
distance. So this must be x, our time 2. And for the second rate, we're

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,926
traveling at 60 miles per hour, so we fill in this with 60. Then, we cross

7
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:35,722
multiply to get 900 equals 60x. We divide both sides by 60 to get x is equal to

8
00:00:35,722 --> 00:00:40,210
15, or 15 minutes. The key for these inverse variation problems is that one

9
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,318
quantity will be in the numerator while the other will be in the denominator. We

10
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:47,653
usually flip the second fraction to make that happen.
