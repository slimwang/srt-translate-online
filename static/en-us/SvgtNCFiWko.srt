1
00:00:00,315 --> 00:00:03,300
So this burst utilitzation, as Stratton and Company call it,

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,783
is usually the most critical factor to optimize for global memory performance

3
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:12,115
and that's where the examples of a ray of structure, the structure of a ray comes in.

4
00:00:12,115 --> 00:00:16,586
But there are also subtler issues like partition camping that can occasionally rear their heads.

5
00:00:16,586 --> 00:00:20,094
So as before, I'll use the ninja icon to indicate topics

6
00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:24,029
that the average GPU programmer probably won't need to concern themselves with.

7
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,264
Now a more sophisticated example of the data layout transformation technique

8
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:32,441
is something called the array of structures of tiled arrays, or ASTA.

9
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:35,184
This technique can address issues like partition camping

10
00:00:35,184 --> 00:00:39,378
and can potentially achieve even better bandwidth utilization on a wider range of architectures.

11
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:43,000
So you'll find a reference in the supplementary materials.
